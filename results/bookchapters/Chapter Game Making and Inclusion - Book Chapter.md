# Literature Review for Chapter on Game Making - Book Chapter

## Context

~~From RSA game making and potential for engagement~~

Game making as a series of software tools that are increasingly easy    to use / have a focus on specific areas e.g. GSM
social approaches - Using the funds of knowledge of YP and families see Ivan Games phd and Gee  discourses

Thus big question how to leverage all the tools and funds in the classroom

### Game Making and Computational Thinking - Approaches via case studies

Relate back to the CT chapter - summary of the abstract / concrete divergence. Then a quick summary of findings of related studies which address CT -maybe top three

**Scalable game design**  Repenning etc - the process of moving to CT

Denner and Werner - explore **game mechanics as design patterns** as apart of wider strategy of identifying programming plans (from Brooks)
Werner, L., Denner, J., Campe, S., 2014. Children Programming Games: A Strategy for Measuring Computational Learning. ACM Transactions on Computing Education 14, 1--22. https://doi.org/10.1145/2677091

Then Game Star Mechanic - the phd? - based on **systems thinking** - as a different set of learning dimensions or similar?

### Game Making and other Learning Dimensions - programming, systems thinking, design thinking

Scratch and Design Thinking - work of Resnick and Kafai.. Cross curriculum stuff.

Game making and Scratch - problematic - no gravity - my own experiences- explore some of the tensions of freedom - compare to Papert and microworlds

What falls out of those studies in terms of wider skills - 21stcentury skills, Design Thinking, Domain specific etc - as per the other chapter .

### My intervention? Map, Missions, Methods

Intro - concept of **Open World Games** - reference James Gee's question - how can we make learning more like a good game - participants are given the feedback then need to progress and monitor their own progress.

First examine the specific interventions, tools and frameworks that educators and designers have used.

Revisit earlier research - point out the ones of SGD and the Denner game mechanics - point out the complexity or assumptions about transfer - say why they may be less appropriate for other contexts. (too sciency - US context no programming in curriculum - or too complex - suitable for researchers to address b

**GSM** - missions, framework of game elements,


**Missions**
come in different kinds - some linked to game mechanics -some to more systems thinking - some to do with engagement, social learning and reflection.


**Methods** - drama methods & designing for an audience (the meta mission), playtesting,

- Recap of Learning Dimensions and effectiveness - Just a recap? -
On going work?
