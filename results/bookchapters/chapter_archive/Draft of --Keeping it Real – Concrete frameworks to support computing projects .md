## Introduction

One of the interesting elements of computing as a subject is the variety of different ways it can be taught. There are many sources of inspiration and information for computing teachers to help build a picture of diversity of approaches to covering the curriculum and building skills and confidence in programming and wider knowledge and approaches. This chapter covers the value of some of the more hands-on teaching approaches and will put this into an academic context in an accessible way by drawing on influential and inspirational research and projects in the field of creative computing.

The start of this chapter outlines some of the theory and  practice of applying an inclusive pedagogic approach to learning to complete computing projects, specifically the benefits of a hands-ons/project based approach. I then look at different interpretations of Computational Thinking from a critical perspective to contrast the concepts-first approach to other more hands-on approaches.

In the second half of the chapter we will look at some of the learning supports available to educators who want, help their learners jump right into coding, sustain interest and reflect on the progress they have made.

To address wider challenges of implementing PBL approaches we look at what is available to help teachers balancing the requirements of the curriculum and doing hands-on work. The question of equality then remains how can young people from a wide variety of backgrounds benefit from this approach. And do this at KS3.

## Context of Teaching Computing in the UK

Embracing the challenge has been a team effort. Universities and spin-off programs have created a diversity of computing environments designed to aid novice programmers. They have followed this with innovative teaching approaches to use the new opportunities made possible by the new software tools. Teachers themselves have been a tremendous source in the sharing of knowledge, materials and approaches to respond to the challenge of embracing new areas of subject brought about by the introduction of a new computing curriculum. Industry too has embraced the challenge with ecosystems of products that

As a result, if you search the web for creative computing there is a tremendous diversity of activities and mediums which have huge potential for engagement of young people and to involve their home and hobby interests. Physical examples include fashion and textiles based computing, robotics, programming lego constructions. Other web-based or software activities include game making, meme creation, hobby website creation, or making storytelling adventures.

A quick search of the web will bring up countless blogs, twitter posts and online groups and individuals sharing exciting tools and creations. However while this train is enticing it is not always clear how to get on board.

Whereas the diversity of materials and end goals of projects are readily visible for teachers and family members enthusiastic to help, the best way to help learners learn, or effective pedagogies to support the coding and computing process are less visible and less exchanged.

However into this space of how best to learn computing there came a strong voice, that of those advocating Computational Thinking. In the next section I will explore CT as a useful concept for teachers but one which has some drawbacks if applied too narrowly.

<!-- ## Coding well is well hard

At this point I want to focus on coding as a particular subset of computing and make the point that it is really hard to learn. I also want to follow that by saying it\'s even harder to teach. There is a lot you need to get right , lots that can go wrong, really specific support is needed and a lot of persistence. Choosing suitable coding projects for novices is hard to get right. They may be too hard or too boring.

Also good Code is hard to read. What I mean by that is when it comes to a modern object oriented approach to coding, this can make the code less easy to read through and predict what it can do. -->


## Interpretations of Computational Thinking

Computational Thinking started to gain attention when an academic and computer scientist called Jeanette Wing began to promote it as a concept and approach that could be useful beyond the field of computing. Wing's perspective is that "everyone... can benefit from thinking like a computer scientist" -@wing_computational_2008. Computational Thinking is the ability to express and solve problems in the same kind of way a computer would. This idea caught on especially at University level. Who wouldn't want to have a skill in your toolbox that is transferable and allows you to solve complex problems in all areas of your studies and life.

### Abstract vs Concrete


- A high-quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world.

The concept of Computational Thinking as transferable knowledge became the most significant aspect of the 2015 Computing curriculum. It suited the conservatives government's back to educational basics agenda championed by ministers Nick Gibbs and Michael Gove. However beyond knowledge about computing, elements of creativity are also clearly vital in the process of creating a computing project.

I do not suggest the concepts of Computational Thinking and Creativity are in opposition to each other. However, for the first part of this chapter I am going to explore the two concepts from an academic perspective as a way of finding useful tensions and variety in the way computing teaching is being approached and promoted.

### Definitions of CT

We can use this distinction to examine different interpretations of Computational Thinking. Let's take two popular interpretations and look at the difference. One is Jeanette Wing's original take. "The most important and high-level thought process in computational thinking is the abstraction process. Abstraction is used in defining patterns, generalizing from instances, and parameterization" @wing_computational_nodate. This makes sense as if you can abstract away concepts and principles from the context then you can apply the same ideas outside of computing.

Another popular definition however has a very different approach. Brennan and Resnick set out a widely used definition of CT which they developed in response to the question ""How do we describe what Tim, Shannon, and Renita are learning as they participate as designers of interactive media with Scratch?" This is a clearly a very different approach but one that has the advantage of being very accessible.

In research terms we could call this more of a situated, ethnographic approach to mapping the learning happening. It asks what are the potential learning dimensions of working with others creating computing projects. The resulting map they create includes concepts, practices and perspectives.

This definition of Computational Thinking so popular for both researchers and educators that when a review of the research on learning Computational Thining through programming was carried out by Lye and Koh -@lye_review_2014, they took this more applied definition and breakdown as the basis for their review.

I want to challenge this definition. Not because it isn't useful. I actually think it is a really useful document to help teachers and researchers understand what to look for and what they can design their programming sessions to facilitate. The review bears that out. However, it seems a bit daft to describe the activities you can develop while doing computing as Computational Thinking as if it were a new unique thing. If you look at the breakdown, then you can see that a lot of practices and perspectives are very general to a process of creating something with peers rather than being unique to computing. I could come up with a concept of Gardening Thinking to represent what gardeners can learn by designing and creating a garden together. This might be a very useful document to people doing community garden education projects but it would be another thing altogether to make the case for   as a transferable set of 21st Century Skills (unless you   advocate for Gardening to be part of the national curriculum).

From an academic perspective we should ask what is unique or special about Computational Thinking. When we compare the two definitions there is a lot of overlap with Design Thinking in Brennan and Resnick's approach. Personally, I think Wing's is a better candidate for something unique. The way it looks at the special ways abstraction is done in computer science is convincing. Convincing but harder to communicate. Without going into detail about ways in which CT has been taught - which is covered in another chapter - there are some really innovative and accessible ways that are proposed. Unplugged, concept mapping and others....

### CT and the problem of Transfer

Mark Guzdial was an early advocate of Computational Thinking and wrote about the possibility of this kind of cross over enthusiastically - find and contextualise - However his enthusiasm has changed in focus he has moved towards a more concrete idea of what Computational Thinking . Has he lost the faith - what's happening here?

The key to this idea is transfer which is a tricky concept to prove when it comes to situations like this. As Mark says, you can't prove a negative, but the evidence for CT being transferred to other areas is weak. There is a school of thinking in educational research which argues that learning how to do something like coding is entangled up in particular situations. So even though CT processes may be at work they are tacit and would be of little use in other situations.

One of the most widely read pieces of research on computing education in the UK was the After the Reboot report from the RSA. This published an alarming but understandable concern from teachers who worried about the academic, abstract nature of higher order Computational Thinking concepts and that they were not easily grasped by students with SEND.

As such, educators need to balance the promise of transfer with the difficulties associated with the more abstract nature of the concepts. Even those who advocate the usefulness of transfer of abstract concepts admit that it is a difficult process. For example, among their [*12principles for teachingcomputing*](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/how-we-teach-computing/)aimed at teachers from the National Centre for Computing Education are ways to counter these difficulties.

Some of the tactics used in the area of computing education include surfing the semantic wave and an approach called expansive framing. (See case studies).

There is also danger that an abstract approach to Computational Thinking, while containing the promise of transfer to other domains, has the danger of distracting teachers from other creative ways of representing the learning outcomes of more hands on approaches.

These concerns are addressed in the 12 principles. Some of these support leading with abstract, others concrete, and tactics for bridging the gaps (semantic wave).

A full summary of the approaches here is not possible but there are some very useful and accessible tips here.

As a rule it seems to be easier to the transmission of more abstract approaches as opposed to hands on ones.

Also I fear that there is a danger that teachers unfamiliar with what CT is, find out themselves in a decontextualised way - and then reproduce that learning. They find accessible and often fun ways to do it through unplugged computing activities. However the danger is that meeting the concepts outside of an authentic context where they are put into practice leads to inert knowledge.

At the time of writing the Is not much available in terms of help on how to use projects to support computing or how to make learning more concrete. This is understandable. It is hard to write in a generalised, abstracted way about something concrete. To do that we need to get into the details.

I do want to challenge a couple of the principles as a way of introducing the next section. Firstly that of leading with concepts first. While this approach may suit some students, I propose that it does not suit others. Also while a concepts, abstract ideas first is well provided for in mainstream STEM education, alternative frameworks and approaches are available to us as computing educators if we want to facilitate a more creative approach.

## Summary of the alternatives / the rest of the chapter

So while the concepts-first strategy has its issues, it is well supported and new techniques informed by research are emerging.

What is less explored, at least in the UK context, are pedagogies and frameworks that support the creative processes involved in making computing projects work.

In another chapter in this book I look at how to apply a project and inclusive approach to game making as a coding and computing project.

For the rest of this chapter, I cover three main areas; design approaches, project approaches and inclusive pedagogies.

### Design Approaches

Michel Resnick was instrumental in the Scratch development team and a pioneer of constructivist learning approaches. We have already seen his commitment to a more hands-on approach in his interpretation of CT earlier. Those principles are drawn from work creating and observing the use of Scratch as a program for novice coders. One of the principles behind the design of Scratch are to make more concrete some of the more abstract principles of coding through design decisions about the program's interface. There are many languages and interfaces which have been created with similar principles, Agent Sheets, Alice and various implementations MakeCode to support physical computing and game making etc.

In more recent works he has been promoting [*the five stage creativecycle*](https://medium.com/@mres/ten-tips-for-cultivating-creativity-fe79e7ebb83e).

Imagine -

There are some parallels and some differences between the framework above and another called Use Modify Create. This pattern is becoming increasingly popular in the computing education sector in the UK.

Use Modify Create framework -

In the **Use** stage, coders build a familiarity with coding interfaces and the some of the through scaffolded approaches. It is not specific how much is taught in terms of the concepts here.

In **Modify** learners progress to working on real projects but one screated by others.

Progressing to the** Create** stage - is not an immediate process. As novices pick up patterns of code design in use in the modify section, they are in a good place to replicate such patterns in other code that they create from scratch.

The process of learning to use the production tools, familiarising yourself with the materials and hands on reality of creating something has been well described using a framework called Studio Thinking - the 8different habits of mind were arrived at though ethnographic observation, and each of these habits was supported by teachers through stages of lecture/demonstration, hands on making, and critique/reflection.

![](./Pictures/10000000000001E7000002826528E0BA8C1E0F11.jpg){width="5.0728in"height="6.6874in"}

Other STEM focused researchers have drawn on the process that emerged from art education community of practice in a studio and have proposed it as a good learning process for STEM.. Sawyer argues for a reduced formulation of studio practice in STEM outlining the following aspects.

-   Complex, authentic, real-world projects-   Guided problem solving-   Curriculum design-   Externalization and reflection

He argues this approach is more suited to the learning sciences than the instruction based or apprentice oriented ones often in place. He cites these approaches as two sides of a spectrum. Studio practice is a third approach, open but guided. Sawyer also makes a link with PBL, an approach that is explored later in this chapter.

We can start to see large similarities between Design Thinking, creative spiral, UMC and Studio thinking. What they have in common - that is distinct from more traditional classroom approaches - is a focus on devoting time to hands on making, structured support to aid inspire learners and facilitate observation of practice of others and a great choice in what goals learners set.

This craft approach and the underlying pattern of the Use Modify Create guidance will be familiar to most professional and hobbyist coders. It is rare in today's coding environment to start anything really from scratch. The first stage will be to research what code frameworks will help your job and what already written modules can be incorporated .Once you have worked out where the gaps are then you start coding tostart plumbing the pieces together and to patch any of the gaps thatappear. It's often a dirty job but this is the reality of coding today.

## Design Patterns as an educational tool

My own efforts in this area centre around the use of design patterns. My own journey in computing has very much been as a modifier of code. You could say my motto was - keep coding crap - now that is not strictly true, but what is true is that I managed to create a lot of useful websites with code that was very far from elegant representation of Computational Thinking concepts. They did a useful job and every one improved my skills along the way.

I am not trying to say everyone should learn how to code in this way. However, it is a valid way that has been seen to suit many novices.

This recalls early writing in the field of studying how young people learn how to code which celebrates the power of this kind of concrete approach as an alternative to teaching coding starting with first principles.

As I retrained in computing in a proper way, one the most instructive and relatable pieces of coding tuition came in the form of studying design patterns to help an object oriented approach.

The advantage of DP as a way of teaching and learning coding is that they are often rooted in real life examples of problems that are often solved in a particular way. This can be described as a concrete implementation of object oriented principles.

The limits of time prevent me from describing the use of design patterns in great detail but this is explored in more depth in another chapter in this collection.

### UDL as Learning Framework

Misconception of many new teachers that to address the learning needs of SEND pupils they will need to create an alternative lesson plan.

However, new understandings represented in concepts of neurodiversity indicate that everyone has limitations and strengths in different areas, so everyone has special or particular needs. Does this mean a teacher would need 30 lesson plans. Clearly this is impossible.

So an alternative is available in the form of designing the learning experience in a way that allows learners to choose the level that is most appropriate for them. Dom says... student often choose the level that is appropriate for them.

This sounds chaotic and at times that is an experience that observers comment on when observing a learning community in full swing. However the process of designing for learners to allow this has guidance in place in UDL guidelines.

![](./Pictures/10000201000003AB000002FA7741B2C2B1FB6101.png){width="6.5in"height="5.278in"}

This seems complicated and for many of us used to a three part lesson plan with set learning outcomes it certainly requires a shift in approach.

The perhaps the most challenging and fundamental is the guideline to provide options for individual choice and autonomy. We explore this in more depth in the next section.

Another is authenticity and personal relevance and value. This could be one of the biggest challenges to a concepts first approach.

### The Potential of Project Based Learning

In the next section I'll cover the potential of project based learning and how this can create inclusive educational approaches. As you will see there are strong parallels with UDL especially in promoting choice and authenticity.

Project-based learning is a wide set of approaches and put simply can be seen as the value of learning via students undertaking practical projects rather than more traditional approaches designed to help the absorption and recall of more book based knowledge.

As PBL has been adopted by higher education and become the focus of academic study then frameworks have emerged as a way of helping practitioners to help students squeeze as much learning as they can from the process and to recognise the complexity of some of the learning happening. This is important as sometimes some of the learning is tacit/hidden learning which is hard to assess in traditional ways.

As a way of quickly communicating the kind of learning that PBL promotes we can represent them in a visual form followed by a table to break down what the categories mean.

![](./Pictures/10000000000004B000000604C4D19211EDEC1B8E.png){width="3.2035in"height="3.3957in"}

  -------------------------- ---------------------------  **PBL Terms**              **Definition / Examples**  Challenging Problem          Authenticity               Real Life Relevance  Student Voice and Choice     Public Project               Critique and Revision        Reflection                   Sustained Inquiry            -------------------------- ---------------------------

Computing education is an excellent vehicle for a project-based approach to learning. As we explored in the introduction, the nature of digitalmaking and the many flavours that are available provides a wide-range of choices of outputs. Projects that create real outcomes that the learner has a choice over are a great way to motivational factor (Blumenfeld).

#### More about challenges and benefits of PBL

But a bit more about project based learning - and how to design it in a computing situation.

## Creatively Overcoming Limitations In Context

All of the approaches above have research to support the benefits of the approach and in a context of inclusive pedagogies we can make a strong case for teachers to adopt them in computing education as a suitable candidate for project based, inclusive approaches.

But there are challenges of exam focus, time poverty, and lack of PBL delivery skills that are among factors hindering take up. This section looks at tips and strategies that have been used by other educators and researchers to overcome these barriers.

Resnick advises double lessons and whole terms devoted to projects. This may not be possible in exam focused classes but may be possible in some situations especially in KS2.

For example, cross-curricular projects may free up more time by linking. Kafai was successful in gaining more time linking computing project with maths as a subject by asking students to create a game that taught maths concepts. Thus deepening their learning of a particular area of the maths curriculum.

Many teachers will add in projects to the end of a series of work to reinforce concept in a practical context and that is certainly better than nothing, but it is likely to reduce effectiveness.

Meeting in the Middle - tactics to bring together approaches. The student that favour a concept first approach are able to choose that path from the start building up coding knowledge and foundational concepts in a structured way. Other student may favour more concrete approaches and jump right in, the learning design then allows teachers to guide their reflection on completed activities that allows connection to the underlying concepts that are a required part of the curriculum.

PBL and UDL would promote not Concepts First, but Choice First, either a concrete exploration, which allows students to meet the concepts in a practical setting first.

I explore the idea of a strategy to 'meet in the middle' allowing students to experience both the more abstract concepts entangled in the process of planning and coding a project in the context of game making in another chapter in this collection.
