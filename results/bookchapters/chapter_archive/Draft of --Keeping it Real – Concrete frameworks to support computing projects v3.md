## Introduction

One of the interesting aspects of computing as a subject is the variety of different ways it can be taught. Many sources of inspiration exist for computing teachers promoting diverse approaches to covering the computing curriculum, building skills in programming and developing wider computer science knowledge. This chapter highlight the value of some of the more hands-on teaching approaches and will put this into an academic context in an accessible way by drawing on influential and inspirational research and projects in the field of creative computing.

### Context of Teaching Computing in the UK

The shift to computing from ICT is covered in other chapters in this book.



Computational Thinking started to gain wider attention when the academic and computer scientist Jeanette Wing began to promote it as a concept and approach that could be useful beyond the field of computing. Wing's perspective is that "everyone... can benefit from thinking like a computer scientist" -@wing_computational_2008. Computational Thinking is the ability to express and solve problems in the same kind of way a computer would.

I do not suggest the concepts of Computational Thinking and Creativity are in opposition to each other. However, for the first part of this chapter I am going to explore both concepts from an academic perspective as a way of finding useful tensions and variety in the way computing teaching is being approached and promoted.

I will use the lens of projects to examine creativity in computing.  

The start of this chapter outlines some of the theory and practice of applying an inclusive approach to computing projects, specifically the benefits of a hands-ons/project based approach. I then look at different interpretations of Computational Thinking from a critical perspective to contrast the concepts-first approach to other more hands-on approaches.

In the second half of the chapter we will look at some of the learning supports available to educators who want, help their learners jump right into coding, sustain interest and reflect on the progress they have made.

To address wider challenges of implementing PBL approaches we look at what is available to help teachers balancing the requirements of the curriculum and doing hands-on work. To address questions equality I explore how can young people from a wide variety of backgrounds benefit from this approach.

Whereas the diversity of materials and end goals of projects are readily visible for teachers and family members enthusiastic to help, the best way to help learners learn, or effective pedagogies to support the coding and computing process are less visible and less exchanged.

We address some of the benefits in the next section and then deconstruct elements of Computational Thinking following this and finally


Other chapters in this book deal with the strategies like PRIMM and Unplugged computing to communicate the more abstract concepts of computational thinking suited to classroom teaching. This chapter explores more concrete frameworks and project based approaches.

## A note on inclusion

The subject of inclusion is explored in other chapters of this book. For this chapter I will focus on UDL later as an inclusive pedagogies well suited to a project based approach. In this section I will explain a definition of inclusion that widens beyond a SEND perspective to involve issues of alienation from school culture.

Black Hawkins take on inclusion explains that ...

As explored elsewhere, the issue of alienation from computing in schools can be an issue especially for girls and some ethnic minorities.

This is way a social and cultural approach to understanding the learning experience of pupils in a wider ecosystem beyond school is so vital. Pedagogies which focus only on a 60 minute lesson plan are limiting in this regard.

Embracing the challenge of making computing projects accessible and has been a team effort. Universities and spin-off programs have created a diversity of computing environments designed to aid novice programmers. They have followed this with innovative teaching approaches to use the new opportunities made possible by the new software tools. Teachers themselves have been a tremendous source in the sharing of knowledge, materials and approaches to respond to the challenge of embracing new areas of subject brought about by the introduction of a new computing curriculum. Industry too has embraced the challenge with ecosystems of products that

As a result, if you search the web for creative computing there is a tremendous diversity of activities and mediums which have huge potential for engagement of young people and to involve their home and hobby interests. Physical examples include fashion and textiles based computing, robotics, programming lego constructions. Other web-based or software activities include game making, meme creation, hobby website creation, or making storytelling adventures.

A quick search of the web will bring up countless blogs, twitter posts and online groups and individuals sharing exciting tools and creations. However while this train is enticing it is not always clear how to get on board.

Computational Thinking is a contested term. But if people can't agree on what it is, there is general agreement that computational thinking is not just computer coding. I know this from personal experience as I learned how to become a proficient coder without knowing anything about what Wing would define as CT concepts.

In fact many studies that look at how coders learn focus not on overarching computational ideas but how they pick up the nuts and bolts of how computing projects are put together from a community they are a part of. Some researchers call this a craft approach to coding and it has strong links with another line of research on Studio ways of learning called Studio thinking.

When I learned coding it was to create websites for community music events and environmental and social justice campaigns. In learning how to code websites, I also had to learn to use other tools to upload files to a web server and then about server file permissions (a useful gateway to linux computing). Having these projects as my base for learning helped in a few crucial ways. Firstly the real life application was great motivation for me to push past technical barriers, there were also similar projects that I could use as inspiration and copy and modify their code solutions and finally if I got stuck there was a friendly community of web site creators working on similar non-profit projects who were willing to share their skills and resources.

Not all young people have access to that kind of motivation and community but there are educational projects which are designed to replicate this kind of project based approach to learning coding and computing. This is visible in maker fairs, online videos and communities and initiatives like the Coolest Project where .....

One of the reasons that I am writing this chapter is to advocate for this approach to learning coding and justify it in relation to existing research. Coding may not be the same as computational thinking but it is part of the computing curriculum and a useful skill in itself. It is the water in which learners swim when creating engaging computing projects where such wider computing concepts are developed.

I argue that mixing up the already abstract / technical terminology of coding with the even more abstract computational thinking concepts increases the difficulty for learners to keep a track of their learning. 

In short I advocate leading with project goals first approach rather than computational thinking concepts AND focusing on coding and design concepts as the framework for learners to help navigate the learning that happens in these projects.  



This section has been a quick introductory sketch of some of the benefits of a project based approach. In a later section I look at frameworks and other studies that support a project-based approach.



### Definitions of CT

We can use this distinction to examine different interpretations of Computational Thinking. Let's take two popular interpretations and look at the difference. One is Jeanette Wing's original take. "The most important and high-level thought process in computational thinking is the abstraction process. Abstraction is used in defining patterns, generalizing from instances, and parameterization" [@wing_computational_nodate]. This makes sense as if you can abstract away concepts and principles from the context then you can apply the same ideas outside of computing.

Another popular definition however has a very different approach. Brennan and Resnick set out a widely used definition of CT which they developed in response to the question ""How do we describe what Tim, Shannon, and Renita are learning as they participate as designers of interactive media with Scratch?" This is a clearly a very different approach but one that has the advantage of being very accessible.

In research terms we could call this more of a situated, ethnographic approach to mapping the learning happening. It asks what are the potential learning dimensions of working with others creating computing projects. The resulting map they create includes concepts, practices and perspectives.

This definition of Computational Thinking so popular for both researchers and educators that when a review of the research on learning Computational Thinking through programming was carried out by Lye and Koh -@lye_review_2014, they took this more applied definition and breakdown as the basis for their review.

(The review finds that) this is a really useful document to help teachers and researchers understand what to look for and what they can design their programming sessions to facilitate. If you look at the breakdown, then you can see that a lot of practices and perspectives are very general to a process of creating something with peers rather than being unique to computing. This map of the concepts and skills that learners can develop while doing computing projects may certainly be useful but you can't argue that this definition Computational Thinking is unique. Certainly from an academic perspective we need to ask what is special about Computational Thinking.

When we compare the two definitions there is a lot of overlap with Design Thinking in Brennan and Resnick's approach.

Wing's is a better candidate for something unique. The way it looks at the special ways abstraction is done in computer science is convincing.

Convincing but harder to communicate. Without going into detail about ways in which CT has been taught - which is covered in another chapter - there are some really innovative and accessible ways that are proposed. Unplugged, concept mapping and others....

Another take on CT critiques Wing fron the other angle. According to Denner and Tendre -@tedre_long_2016, Wing's view of CT over eggs the possibility of transfer to other areas beyond what is shown in the research and has a too narrow view of CT.

### CT, Abstract / Concrete and the issue of Transfer

Mark Guzdial was an early advocate of Computational Thinking and wrote about the possibility of this kind of cross over enthusiastically - find and contextualise - However his enthusiasm has changed in focus he has moved towards a more concrete idea of what Computational Thinking . Has he lost the faith - what's happening here?

The key to this idea is transfer which is a tricky concept to prove when it comes to situations like this. As Mark says, you can't prove a negative, but the evidence for CT being transferred to other areas is weak. There is a school of thinking in educational research which argues that learning how to do something like coding is entangled up in particular situations. So even though CT processes may be at work they are tacit and would be of little use in other situations.

One of the most widely read pieces of research on computing education in the UK was the After the Reboot report from the RSA. This published an alarming but understandable concern from teachers who worried about the academic, abstract nature of higher order Computational Thinking concepts and that they were not easily grasped by students with SEND.

There is a danger that teachers unfamiliar with what CT is, find out themselves in a decontextualised way - and then reproduce that learning. They find accessible and often fun ways to do it through unplugged computing activities. However the danger is that meeting the concepts outside of an authentic context where they are put into practice leads to inert knowledge.

To counter act this danger there has been good recent work by NCCE .

Educators need to balance the promise of transfer with the difficulties associated with the more abstract nature of the concepts.

For example, among their [*12principles for teachingcomputing*](https://blog.teachcomputing.org/how-we-teach-computing/)aimed at teachers from the National Centre for Computing Education are ways to counter these difficulties. Some of the tactics used in the area of computing education include surfing the semantic wave and an approach called expansive framing.   

SEMANTIC WAVE approach - leading with concepts.

The process of working to integrate
the approach has the advantage of

EXPANSIVE FRAMING
Another similar approach to the semantic wave is that of expansive framing. The core idea of this approach is to meet similar abstract concepts in different


What these theories have in common is an attempt to address the tricky issue of transfer. What the next section asks is do we need to know about transfer to learn to code?

PRIMM

This has been promoted extensively in resources pitched at teachers in recently years. It has been extended from a more open framework Use, Modify and Create.

For a good summary of this approach see articles in Hello World.


### CT isn't Coding - but it's a good place to learn it

CT isn't coding. Or at least it isn't just coding (if we take the more concrete definition of CT from Resnick and Brennan). However, if you want to learn CT concepts then you'll need to do so in a concrete context - and well a coding project is a good place to start.

As an analogy - you have to be able to X to then reflect on Y

And if you agree that a good way to develop CT is through coding projects then teachers will value the process of strategies and model to support project-based coding.


## Summary of the alternatives / the rest of the chapter

There are concerns and alternatives ....

There is also danger that an abstract approach to Computational Thinking, while containing the promise of transfer to other domains, has the danger of distracting teachers from other creative ways of representing the learning outcomes of more hands on approaches.

These concerns are addressed in the 12 principles. Some of these support leading with abstract, others concrete, and tactics for bridging the gaps (semantic wave).


I do want to challenge a couple of the principles as a way of introducing the next section. Firstly that of leading with concepts first. While this approach may suit some students, I propose that it does not suit others. Also while a concepts, abstract ideas first is well provided for in mainstream STEM education, alternative frameworks and approaches are available to us as computing educators if we want to facilitate a more creative approach.

So while the concepts-first strategy has its issues, it is well supported and new techniques informed by research are emerging.

What is less explored, at least in the UK context, are pedagogies and frameworks that support the creative processes involved in making computing projects work.

In another chapter in this book I look at how to apply a project and inclusive approach to game making as a coding and computing project.

For the rest of this chapter, I cover three main areas; design approaches, project approaches and inclusive pedagogies.

### Design Approaches

Michel Resnick was instrumental in the Scratch development team and a pioneer of constructivist learning approaches. We have already seen his commitment to a more hands-on approach in his interpretation of CT earlier. Those principles are drawn from work creating and observing the use of Scratch as a program for novice coders. One of the principles behind the design of Scratch are to make more concrete some of the more abstract principles of coding through design decisions about the program's interface. There are many languages and interfaces which have been created with similar principles, Agent Sheets, Alice and various implementations MakeCode to support physical computing and game making etc.

In more recent works he has been promoting [*the five stage creativecycle*](https://medium.com/@mres/ten-tips-for-cultivating-creativity-fe79e7ebb83e).

Imagine -

There are some parallels and some differences between the framework above and another called Use Modify Create. This pattern is becoming increasingly popular in the computing education sector in the UK.

Use Modify Create framework -

In the **Use** stage, coders build a familiarity with coding interfaces and the some of the through scaffolded approaches. It is not specific how much is taught in terms of the concepts here.

In **Modify** learners progress to working on real projects but one created by others.

Progressing to the **Create** stage - is not an immediate process. As novices pick up patterns of code design in use in the modify section, they are in a good place to replicate such patterns in other code that they create from scratch.

The process of learning to use the production tools, familiarising yourself with the materials and hands on reality of creating something has been well described using a framework called Studio Thinking - the 8different habits of mind were arrived at though ethnographic observation, and each of these habits was supported by teachers through stages of lecture/demonstration, hands on making, and critique/reflection.

![](./Pictures/10000000000001E7000002826528E0BA8C1E0F11.jpg){width="5.0728in"height="6.6874in"}

Other STEM focused researchers have drawn on the process that emerged from art education community of practice in a studio and have proposed it as a good learning process for STEM.. Sawyer argues for a reduced formulation of studio practice in STEM outlining the following aspects.

-   Complex, authentic, real-world projects-   Guided problem solving-   Curriculum design-   Externalization and reflection

He argues this approach is more suited to the learning sciences than the instruction based or apprentice oriented ones often in place. He cites these approaches as two sides of a spectrum. Studio practice is a third approach, open but guided. Sawyer also makes a link with PBL, an approach that is explored later in this chapter.

We can start to see large similarities between Design Thinking, creative spiral, UMC and Studio thinking. What they have in common - that is distinct from more traditional classroom approaches - is a focus on devoting time to hands on making, structured support to aid inspire learners and facilitate observation of practice of others and a great choice in what goals learners set.

This craft approach and the underlying pattern of the Use Modify Create guidance will be familiar to most professional and hobbyist coders. It is rare in today's coding environment to start anything really from scratch. The first stage will be to research what code frameworks will help your job and what already written modules can be incorporated .Once you have worked out where the gaps are then you start coding to start plumbing the pieces together and to patch any of the gaps thatappear. It's often a dirty job but this is the reality of coding today.

## Design Patterns as an educational tool

My own efforts in this area centre around the use of design patterns. My own journey in computing has very much been as a modifier of code. You could say my motto was - keep coding crap - now that is not strictly true, but what is true is that I managed to create a lot of useful websites with code that was very far from elegant representation of Computational Thinking concepts. They did a useful job and every one improved my skills along the way.

I am not trying to say everyone should learn how to code in this way. However, it is a valid way that has been seen to suit many novices.

This recalls early writing in the field of studying how young people learn how to code which celebrates the power of this kind of concrete approach as an alternative to teaching coding starting with first principles.

As I retrained in computing in a proper way, one the most instructive and relatable pieces of coding tuition came in the form of studying design patterns to help an object oriented approach.

The advantage of DP as a way of teaching and learning coding is that they are often rooted in real life examples of problems that are often solved in a particular way. This can be described as a concrete implementation of object oriented principles.

The limits of time prevent me from describing the use of design patterns in great detail but this is explored in more depth in another chapter in this collection.

### UDL as Learning Framework

Misconception of many new teachers that to address the learning needs of SEND pupils they will need to create an alternative lesson plan.

However, new understandings represented in concepts of neurodiversity indicate that everyone has limitations and strengths in different areas, so everyone has special or particular needs. Does this mean a teacher would need 30 lesson plans. Clearly this is impossible.

So an alternative is available in the form of designing the learning experience in a way that allows learners to choose the level that is most appropriate for them. Dom says... student often choose the level that is appropriate for them.

This sounds chaotic and at times that is an experience that observers comment on when observing a learning community in full swing. However the process of designing for learners to allow this has guidance in place in UDL guidelines.

![](./Pictures/10000201000003AB000002FA7741B2C2B1FB6101.png){width="6.5in"height="5.278in"}

This seems complicated and for many of us used to a three part lesson plan with set learning outcomes it certainly requires a shift in approach.

The perhaps the most challenging and fundamental is the guideline to provide options for individual choice and autonomy. We explore this in more depth in the next section.

Another is authenticity and personal relevance and value. This could be one of the biggest challenges to a concepts first approach.

### The Potential of Project Based Learning

In the next section I'll cover the potential of project based learning and how this can create inclusive educational approaches. As you will see there are strong parallels with UDL especially in promoting choice and authenticity.

Project-based learning is a wide set of approaches and put simply can be seen as the value of learning via students undertaking practical projects rather than more traditional approaches designed to help the absorption and recall of more book based knowledge.

As PBL has been adopted by higher education and become the focus of academic study then frameworks have emerged as a way of helping practitioners to help students squeeze as much learning as they can from the process and to recognise the complexity of some of the learning happening. This is important as sometimes some of the learning is tacit/hidden learning which is hard to assess in traditional ways.

As a way of quickly communicating the kind of learning that PBL promotes we can represent them in a visual form followed by a table to break down what the categories mean.

![](./Pictures/10000000000004B000000604C4D19211EDEC1B8E.png){width="3.2035in"height="3.3957in"}

  -------------------------- ---------------------------  **PBL Terms**              **Definition / Examples**  Challenging Problem          Authenticity               Real Life Relevance  Student Voice and Choice     Public Project               Critique and Revision        Reflection                   Sustained Inquiry            -------------------------- ---------------------------

Computing education is an excellent vehicle for a project-based approach to learning. As we explored in the introduction, the nature of digitalmaking and the many flavours that are available provides a wide-range of choices of outputs. Projects that create real outcomes that the learner has a choice over are a great way to motivational factor (Blumenfeld).

#### More about challenges and benefits of PBL

But a bit more about project based learning - and how to design it in a computing situation.

## Creatively Overcoming Limitations In Context

All of the approaches above have research to support the benefits of the approach and in a context of inclusive pedagogies we can make a strong case for teachers to adopt them in computing education as a suitable candidate for project based, inclusive approaches.

But there are challenges of exam focus, time poverty, and lack of PBL delivery skills that are among factors hindering take up. This section looks at tips and strategies that have been used by other educators and researchers to overcome these barriers.

Resnick advises double lessons and whole terms devoted to projects. This may not be possible in exam focused classes but may be possible in some situations especially in KS2.

For example, cross-curricular projects may free up more time by linking. Kafai was successful in gaining more time linking computing project with maths as a subject by asking students to create a game that taught maths concepts. Thus deepening their learning of a particular area of the maths curriculum.

Science is a common way to explore cross over. Very successful project used computational patterns as a navigational base scalable game design.

I am lucky  to have been able to experiment with this as part of EdLab project - I have worked with drama practitioners to explore issues of computing ethics through coding and writing in role.


Many teachers will add in projects to the end of a series of work to reinforce concept in a practical context and that is certainly better than nothing, but it is likely to reduce effectiveness.

Meeting in the Middle - tactics to bring together approaches. The student that favour a concept first approach are able to choose that path from the start building up coding knowledge and foundational concepts in a structured way. Other student may favour more concrete approaches and jump right in, the learning design then allows teachers to guide their reflection on completed activities that allows connection to the underlying concepts that are a required part of the curriculum.

PBL and UDL would promote not Concepts First, but Choice First, either a concrete exploration, which allows students to meet the concepts in a practical setting first.

I explore the idea of a strategy to 'meet in the middle' allowing students to experience both the more abstract concepts entangled in the process of planning and coding a project in the context of game making in another chapter in this collection.
