Investigating the potential of multi-generational game making using code playgrounds ====================================================================================

Background ----------

Digital literacy and informed participation in digital spaces in a context of increased complexity is a challenge being addressed by formal and informal learning spaces.

[]{#anchor}An area of great potential is multiage / intergenerational learning, different aged young people and family members, to widen scope of possible interactions.

This research is especially needed by practitioners in "third spaces" like museum, libraries and after school clubs where initiatives like Code Club and Coder Dojo []{#ZOTERO_TEMP RND4annV4YkW4}{Citation}.

Motivational issues for digital production addressed by creating games

with a particular focus on participatory culture approaches as outlined by Jenkins []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"QYECwBMu","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Jenkins, 2008)","plainCitation":"(Jenkins, 2008)"},"citationItems":[{"id":2612,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/SJMIXMR9"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/SJMIXMR9"],"itemData":{"id":2612,"type":"book","title":"Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide","publisher":"NYU Press","publisher-place":"New York, NY","number-of-pages":"368","edition":"Rev Ed edition","source":"Amazon","event-place":"New York, NY","abstract":"Henry Jenkins at Authors@Google (video)Winner of the 2007 Society for Cinema and Media Studies Katherine Singer Kovacs Book Award2007 Choice Outstanding Academic Title Convergence Culture maps a new territory: where old and new media intersect, where grassroots and corporate media collide, where the power of the media producer and the power of the consumer interact in unpredictable ways.Henry Jenkins, one of America’s most respected media analysts, delves beneath the new media hype to uncover the important cultural transformations that are taking place as media converge. He takes us into the secret world of Survivor Spoilers, where avid internet users pool their knowledge to unearth the show’s secrets before they are revealed on the air. He introduces us to young Harry Potter fans who are writing their own Hogwarts tales while executives at Warner Brothers struggle for control of their franchise. He shows us how The Matrix has pushed transmedia storytelling to new levels, creating a fictional world where consumers track down bits of the story across multiple media channels.Jenkins argues that struggles over convergence will redefine the face of American popular culture. Industry leaders see opportunities to direct content across many channels to increase revenue and broaden markets. At the same time, consumers envision a liberated public sphere, free of network controls, in a decentralized media environment. Sometimes corporate and grassroots efforts reinforce each other, creating closer, more rewarding relations between media producers and consumers. Sometimes these two forces are at war.Jenkins provides a riveting introduction to the world where every story gets told and every brand gets sold across multiple media platforms. He explains the cultural shift that is occurring as consumers fight for control across disparate channels, changing the way we do business, elect our leaders, and educate our children.","ISBN":"978-0-8147-4295-2","shortTitle":"Convergence Culture","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Henry"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9,1]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDZRloFrrpsW}(Jenkins, 2008). and []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"dD0KIetk","properties":{"formattedCitation":"{\\rtf (Sch\\uc0\\u228{}fer, 2011)}","plainCitation":"(Schäfer, 2011)"},"citationItems":[{"id":4586,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/HH8D7RYC"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/HH8D7RYC"],"itemData":{"id":4586,"type":"book","title":"Bastard culture! how user participation transforms cultural production","collection-title":"MediaMatters","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","number-of-pages":"249","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-90-8964-256-1","call-number":"HM651 .S33 2011","note":"OCLC: ocn730264174","author":[{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Mirko Tobias"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDSloxxp5PXw}(Schäfer, 2011)

Accessibility address by multiple paths and mediums and creating a playful game making community

There have been studies on multiple paths but there is still more to learn in this area as new possibilities are afforded by new tools and participatory processes.

All users familiar with surface technology but most unlikely to be fluent in underlying technology of HTML, css and javascript languages. As the web is an authentic environment. There are well established tools and processes to help peer production which can be adapted for our participants.
