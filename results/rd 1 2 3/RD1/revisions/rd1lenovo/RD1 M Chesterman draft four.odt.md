Investigating the potential of collaborative multi-generational game making using code playgrounds ==================================================================================================

Background ----------

Digital literacy and informed participation in digital spaces in a context of increased complexity is a challenge being addressed by formal and informal learning spaces.

[]{#anchor}An area of great potential is multiage / intergenerational learning, different aged young people and family members, to widen scope of possible interactions.

This research is especially needed by practitioners in "third spaces" including museums, libraries and after school clubs where initiatives like Code Club and Coder Dojo

From participatory culture, I will examine how technologies are appropriated by users in the context of this study []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"dD0KIetk","properties":{"formattedCitation":"{\\rtf (Sch\\uc0\\u228{}fer, 2011)}","plainCitation":"(Schäfer, 2011)"},"citationItems":[{"id":4586,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/HH8D7RYC"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/HH8D7RYC"],"itemData":{"id":4586,"type":"book","title":"Bastard culture! how user participation transforms cultural production","collection-title":"MediaMatters","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","number-of-pages":"249","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-90-8964-256-1","call-number":"HM651 .S33 2011","note":"OCLC: ocn730264174","author":[{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Mirko Tobias"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDSloxxp5PXw}(Schäfer, 2011).

Accessibility address by **multiple paths **and mediums and creating a playful game making community, wide walls, many mediums. There have been studies on multiple paths but there is still more to learn in this area as new possibilities are afforded by new tools and participatory processes.

From Papert "epistemological pluralism" is foregrounded. But there are limitations of this focus skewed by technology focus of study around one tool.

For example, we can look at learning around constructivist learning environments (jonassen) and see a focus on digital first environments.

What more can we learn about the impact of wider pluralism involving non digital non coding from a design environment highlighting learner control.

All users familiar with surface technology but most unlikely to be fluent in underlying technology of HTML, css and javascript languages. As the web is an **authentic environment.** There are well established tools and processes to help peer production which can be adapted for our participants.

-   Code playgrounds using authentic web technologies together with     technical scaffolding to facilitate the process -   code project forking and ability to trace origins of projects -   code broadcasting allowing remote sharing and thus coding     collaboration

Participatory culture encompasses various practices and ethos

\

DIY / Maker culture - Game making often pushing cost limits. But web makes it possible to have a low fi approach. **Physicality**, arcade emulators, physical objects

Theoretical Framework

Constructivism will form the core theoretical foundation for this study, in particular the social collaborative elements of the theory.

A Constructionist lens will be used to describe educational application of constructivist concepts focusing on the role of physical materials and digital objects in the learning process .

Activity theory will be used to represent complexity of learning process to go beyond efficacy of interventions to study interactions including power relations, helping behaviour, role of mediating objects, participant questioning and problem solving strategies.

Methods and Activities

Data gathering will be undertaken in stages. Each stage will build on the next. For brevity, a table used to set out the studies research questions in chronological order and summarise the data gathering and analysis process.

In stage one (Questions 1 & 2) research will take the form of a literature review, pilot activities and interviews with participant and other practitioners in the field to inform the design of future activities.

Stage two will involve creating an experimental design around regular game making activities involving Greater Manchester families. Home education networks and schools local to MMU will be the source for participants.

The experimental design of the learning environment will be informed by interviews with participants and practitioners in stage one of the study. Question 3
