**Investigating the potential of collaborative intergenerational game making**

**Background**

The increasing prevalence and complexity of digital technology and the subsequent lag in associated teaching strategies is addressed in a recent report on UK computer education (The Royal Society, 2017). The report highlights the potential of digital game making to enhance computing provision and need for more research into this area. It also foregrounds Wing's conception of computational thinking, which prioritises abstract thought processes and pre-planning, as a key component of a computing curriculum (2006).

Game making is already happening in informal settings including museums, libraries and after school clubs via initiatives like Code Club and Coder Dojo. Here, non-expert volunteers and younger participants form intergenerational learning communities to create games together using accessible technology (Cucinelli et al., 2018). While these environments have great potential to inform practice in digital making, teaching of computing and intergenerational approaches, sparse research exists.

This is disappointing as pioneers of game making Papert and Turkle explored the value of diverse learner pathways, social approaches and multiple media in learning environments in early studies (1990). However many subsequent studies in field have prioritised individual computing progress using particular software tools rather than playful possibilities of material and community activities to support learner autonomy and collaboration in digital making.

In light of this, this study will draw on the potential video games as a cultural object around which rich learning communities form. The resulting focus will be an exploration of optimal strategies for the playful re-appropriation of game mechanics, assets and narratives of video games influenced by conceptions of participatory culture (Schäfer, 2011).

**Theoretical Framework **

Constructivism will form the core theoretical foundation for this study, in particular the social collaborative elements of the theory. This study is influenced by the applied constructivist approaches of student centred learning, particularly the aspects of feedback, collaboration and learner autonomy (Grabinger and Dunlap, 1995). Additionally, a constructionist lens will further describe the application of constructivist concepts through a focus on the roles of physical materials and digital objects in the learning process.

Activity theory will be used to represent complexity of learning process including power relations, helping behaviour, role of mediating objects, participant questioning and problem solving strategies (Engeström, 1999).

**Methods and Activities**

Data gathering will be undertaken in stages. Stage one (RQ1) includes a pilot of eight two hours sessions with pilot group (home education families), four interviews with practitioners in the field and four with families active in the field. Stage two (RQ2,4) incorporates a co-design approach using participant information from RQ1 to create a pedagogical framework. Testing of data gathering methods is also carried out in three pilot workshops. Stage three (RQ3,4) comprises data gathering via two iterations of eight two hour sessions with target groups (see table). Stage four includes analysis of data and writing up of results.

As facilitator, I will take the role of participant observer. The focus on user perspective of the learning environment suits the adoption of ethnographic methods including note taking in sessions, supplementary journal entries, study of artefacts created and digital recordings.

Game making will happen at stations exploring different media and activities, including graphics, audio, coding and narrative planning and will be captured using wide-angle video of physical interactions, video screen capture of computer-based interactions.

To enhance data on the user perspective, I will explore methods to recording participant reactions as recorded logs of during the progress of sessions. Follow up interviews will be arranged to study areas of emerging interest.

**Data Analysis **

A literature review will inform research design and creation of a thematic coding scheme to analyse pilot workshop observations. I will use activity theory to analyse interviews of participants in game making communities to prototype activity systems of participants, practices and materials.

I will be looking for key interactions identified in my journal which may illuminate focal and emergent areas. Recordings of these key moments will be analysed with a particular focus on group dynamics using interaction process analysis (Bales, 2001).

Activity systems created as part of RQ1/2 will then be evolved to create a pedagogical framework and associated observations.
