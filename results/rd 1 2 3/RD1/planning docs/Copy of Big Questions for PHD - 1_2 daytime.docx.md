Revised Question areas----------------------

Come up with 5 Questions around these area, then set out methods andanalysis to answer them

-   Multi generational environments

-   Code playgrounds to integrate, and promote meta-learning strategies    > around collaboration and problem solving and scaffold web game    > production

-   Pedagogy of multiple paths via game production (constructivism)

-   How to design environments to be accessible to all Genders

-   Methodology of gathering data via screen capture

Purpose of tesearch-------------------

Digital artefacts surround us.

Life is complex and lack of knowledge is disempowering.

Creating digital objects can help empower us

Value of increasing transparency of digital objects

Part

Computational literacy and thinking is valuable for problem solving

Can be learned in ground up, bricolage way as well as abstract conceptsfirst way.

Diverse Pathways and processes as new tech emerges are always needed tocounter a tendency of instruction heavy approaches that follow new toolsintroduction.

Gaming club is a community o& play, studying how to encourageparticipation in this one, may be applicable to others .

Really, or is it too complex and specific. Well that's the question? Ornot perhaps. As it's another study.

As society changes , and service provider models are not in alignmentwith family values,

maybe a lot of digital learning will happen at home, or facilitated asfamily learning.

What is the role for parents or other adults to be more hands on intheir joint exploration and negotiations of digital issues?

Participatory culture has been around for a while but hasn't made muchof a dent in formal education.

Practices from free software transforming into remix culture have beenwell documented

Much study has focus3d on social media and playful media creation.

But participatory culture is very wide in focus, and rapidly evolving asnew collaborative technologies emerge.

looking at game making using core web technologies

is fruitful as a more direct parallel to collaborative working practices

The use of forking andmerging as a metaphor

While github is prime code example of 5his the barriers to contributionhave spawned other systems code playgrounds.

The ambition of making a game forces adaptation of other code and gamemechanics.

Iterative and collaborative nature of creativity is apparent .Encouraging a give and take back into the community.

How to answer Questions-----------------------

Phase one

Lit review

Interviews with students and teachers

Analysis of code playground interaction

Phase two

Participant questionaires and

Semi strutted interview

Analysis of screen capture and pair programming converstations

Phase three

Lit review

Ethnography / journal

Johns Questions ----------------

What is the link between play, learning and engagement?\2) What are students' existing attitudes towards play and engagement?\3) How does a playful intervention transform students understandings andattitudes of play and engagement?\4) How does a focus on play transform the interpretation of engagementas an educational goal?\5) How does engaging in playful research transform conceptions of play,learning and engagement?

**Background **

Studies can focus on the result

But there is far more to focus on that

Rapberry Pi foundation, could have potential to narrow the discourse onplay and education. And do amazing things.

Micks revised questions ------------------------

1.  What is link between digital (game) making , learning and    > collaboration?

2.  What are families and facilitators attitudes to collaborative    > digital production?

3.  How does a focus on multiple learning paths and collaboration affect    > the learning experience of participants in a digital game making    > environment?

4.  What can we learn about creating accessible digital game making    > environments (for girls)(multiple generations)?

5.  What are the strengths and weaknesses of the use of code playgrounds    > to enable (and measure) participant collaboration (via analysis of    > screen and audio capture of group programming)?

What happens to learning when participants collaborate inmulti-generational game making communities?

**Juliette's comments** - Gender seems very big question here - area forfuture research - focus on intergeneration

**John's comments - A resulting question**

What happen when we use physical objects to facilitate and navigatecollaboration in digital game making environments?

What is the impact on learning as forking and recombining using codepens.

5

Covers a lot, maybe don't put in methodology in question bump it to theother methods part of the table.

There are no questions here about transforming conceptions orinterpretation in relation to target audience. Which may be the codeclub , pi, dojo side of things.

Maybe this is ok as papert already did this with multiple paths in kidscoding and kafai for girls,

But can argue still much to do with target audience who are often notspecialists either in collaboration based teaching or the tech involved.

And there are alwaysnew possibilities offered by new tech some

What are perceptions to collaboration?

What about pair programming?

Analysis of game mechanics via playing games?

What about physical scaffolds to promote collaboration ?

Should I go into school and ask? Gets away from family learningenvironment.

Phase one questions

-   Questions include, what is value , potential of game making

-   Ditto collaboration in digital making

-   What are barriers to both for you implementing and others    > participating

-   What are incentives present

-   Examples of success large and specific incidents

-   What is your experience of using code playgrounds like trinket etc,

-   What effect on collaboration did this tools have,

-   what were limits? To student collaboration

But collaborative global environment, ie supporting pair groupprogramming through structure, especially game mechanics, and physicalobjects, maybe even 3D printed.

Original early Questions------------------------

-   How effective is digital game making to improve problem solving    > skills in intergenerational learning contexts/

-   How to best design an inclusive digital game making environment    > aimed at intergenerational groups?

-   What impact does using authentic web technologies have in terms of    > authenticity of context and goals and resulting motivational    > issues including self determination?

-   What is the impact of code playgrounds and collaborative text code    > projects on integrating multiple strands of project work, and thus    > facilitate a "many paths" approach?

-   Impact of family learning environment on collaborative video games    > making?

-   To what extent can the characteristics of code playgrounds reduce    > fear of text coding?

Notes on possible Methodologies-------------------------------

Questionnaires

-   -   Post questionnaire only, potential self determination focus.

Observation & Documentation

-   Naturalistic observation and notes for emergent issues,

-   Video and screen capture, of a coding work station

-   Audio capture of a coding work station

Analysis ---------

Analysis of the global working environment of club activity via activitytheory framework into interrelated systems. Particular focus on thecombination and manipulation of assets.

Choose an applied and adapted constructivist or constructionistframework or to code activity against also code against a computationalabilities frame, to identify iteration, conditional, etc.

What theory to use here for coding, grounded theory, thematic analysisBoyatzis, probably grounded theory as an ethnography, or similar.

Analysis on

Notes on challenges making environments inclusive --------------------------------------------------

-   Facilitating and planning multiple paths

-   Designing strategies to merge work together.

-   Importance of physical objects in generation processes

-   Strategies to accept complexity, divergent paths and finding ways to    > facilitate participants bringing them together.

**Other big questions from other notes pasted in **

What is the impact of codeplay grounds and collaborative text codeprojects on integrating multiple strands of project work, and thusfacilitate a "many paths" approach.

More visible, transparent.

Easy to fork trickier to recombine

The ease of remixing

Ease of assessing how different it is from original via diff.

Has advantage of being able to analyse statistically.

Disadvantage that not everyone of target age range will engage with textcoding.

This has wide focus, nayralistic thick study

Use the screen to record
