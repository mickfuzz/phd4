Investigating the potential of collaborative multi-generational game making using code playgrounds ==================================================================================================

Background ----------

The increasing prevalence and complexity of digital technology has lead to a lag in associated teaching strategies. Digital literacy and informed participation in digital spaces are challenges being addressed by both formal and informal learning spaces. The creation of games

In formal provision, a Royal Society report on computer education has highlighted the potential of the use of games making and lack of research on this subject .

Another area of potential is intergenerational / multiage and family learning. This research has potential to benefit practitioners in "third spaces" including museums, libraries and after school clubs where initiatives like Code Club and Coder Dojo already have game making elements with multi

Accessibility address by **multiple paths** and mediums and creating a playful game making community, wide walls, many mediums. There have been studies on multiple paths but there is still more to learn in this area as new possibilities are afforded by new tools and participatory processes.

For example in game playing much has been made of activities surrounding the playing in game playing communities. Gee.

While diverse activities a conceptually present at genesis of study of game making in Papert and Turkles concept of "epistemological pluralism" this focus becomes skewed by technology focus of studies based on use of particular software tools and relegate peripheral activities

For example, we can look at learning around constructivist learning environments (jonassen) and see a focus on digital first environments.

When user control is addressed in these contexts it is often within a narrow frame of choices within a software package or suite of programmes.

What more can we learn about the impact on perceptions of control of a designed environment with a wider choice of materials and ,practices related to game making involving non digital non coding from a design environment highlighting learner control.

Take inspiration from Ito et al studies on participatory culture and the learning value of messing around. Also from lowfi ethic rather than hi tech hi cost approaches

while participatory culture is widely applied term, in particular , I will examine how technologies and practices are appropriated by users in the context of this study (SchÃ¤fer, 2011).

As such, This may involve diversion from a focus on a narrow definition of computation thinking skills from Wing.

This diversion may take many forms, but initial observations suggest,

-   Inspiration from graphical demos from code play grounds

-   Pixel art and physical manifestations

-   Storytelling using web technologies

All users familiar with surface technology but most unlikely to be fluent in underlying technology of HTML, css and javascript languages. As the web is an **authentic environment.** There are well established tools and processes to help peer production which can be adapted for our participants.

Code playgrounds using authentic web technologies together with technical scaffolding to facilitate the process

code project forking and ability to trace origins of projects

code broadcasting allowing remote sharing and thus coding collaboration

DIY / Maker culture - Game making often pushing cost limits. But web makes it possible to have a low fi approach. **Physicality**, arcade emulators, physical objects

**Theoretical Framework of research**

Constructivism will form the core theoretical foundation for this study, in particular the social collaborative elements of the theory.

A Constructionist lens will be used to describe educational application of constructivist concepts focusing on the role of physical materials and digital objects in the learning process .

Activity theory will be used to represent complexity of learning process to go beyond efficacy of interventions to study interactions including power relations, helping behaviour, role of mediating objects, participant questioning and problem solving strategies.

**Methods and Activities**

Data gathering will be undertaken in stages. Each stage will build on the next. For brevity, a table used to set out the studies research questions in chronological order and summarise the data gathering and analysis process.

In stage one (Questions 1 & 2) research will take the form of a literature review, pilot activities and interviews with participants and facilitators of game making environments practitioners to shape the issues studied and inform the design of future activities.

Stage two will involve creating an experimental design around regular game making activities involving Greater Manchester families. Home education networks and schools local to MMU will be the source for participants.

The game making environment will be based around different asset making stations. Specifics of the components of the station will be informed be stage one but will include ability to work on graphical and audio assets and supported narrative planning.

As a facilitator of this process I will take the role of participant observer. I will take notes in sessions where possible but will also make extensive use of recording equipment to

**Data Analysis**

**Stage one**

In early stages I will use activity theory to analyse interview of practioners in multi age game making communities. From this I will map potential activity systems built around intersectioning game making practices and materials.

A literature review will be used to supplement research and intervention design decisions and a thematic coding scheme to analyse observations of stage two.

Stage two

Due to the rich naturalistic nature of the environment I will be looking for key interactions identified in my journal which illustrate transformation moments or have potential to illuminate key issues identified in lit

I am particularly interested in results transformations surrounding participation in digital making cultures.
