**Investigating the potential of collaborative multi-generational game making.**

This study seeks greater understanding of processes of the formation of playful game making communities to enhance computing provision in informal learning spaces.

The increasing prevalence and complexity of digital technology and subsequent lag in associated teaching strategies is addressed in a recent report on UK computer education (The Royal Society, 2017) Wing's conception of computational thinking, which is foregrounded in the report as a key component of a computing curriculum, will be critically evaluated in this study (2006). The report also highlights the potential of digital game making to complement existing strategies and the need for more research into this area.

Beyond formal education, there is strong potential for game making in informal learning in museums, libraries and after school clubs via initiatives like Code Club and Coder Dojo. Here, non-expert volunteers, family members and younger participants form intergenerational learning communities about which there is currently sparce research (Cucinelli et al., 2018).

This study will examine a learning environment comprising of diverse pathways and media, a focus present at genesis of studies of digital game making and one explored by Papert and Turkle (1990). While their studies highlighted the pluralism of approaches possible rich game making communities involving both digital and physical objects, many subsequent studies focus on individual progress and particular software tools and thus deemphasise the playful, collaborative possibilities of linked, non-software activities.

**Theoretical Framework** Constructivism will form the core theoretical foundation for this study, in particular the social collaborative elements of the theory. Specifically, this study is influence by the approaches of student centred learning, with a particular focus on the impact of feedback and metacognition on learner autonomy.

A Constructionist lens will focus constructivist concepts focusing on the role of physical materials and digital objects in the learning process.

Activity theory will be used to represent complexity of learning process to go beyond efficacy of interventions to study interactions including power relations, helping behaviour, role of mediating objects, participant questioning and problem solving strategies (Engeström, 1999).

**Methods and Activities**

Data gathering will be undertaken in stages. Stage one (RQ1) includes a pilot of a minimum of eight 2 hours sessions with pilot group (home education families), four interviews with practitioners in the field and four with families active in the field.

Stage two (RQ2,4) incorporates a co-design approach using participant information from RQ1 to create a framework. Testing of data gathering methods is also carried out in three pilot workshops.

Stage three RQ3,4) comprises data gathering via two iterations of eight two hour sessions with target groups (as in table).

Stage four encompasses Analysis of data and writing up of results.

As facilitator, I will take the role of participant observer. I will take notes in sessions, and supplement them with extensive journal entries and use of recording equipment.

Game making will happen at stations exploring different media and activities, including graphic, audio, coding and narrative planning. Video cameras will record activity at each of the stations. Where coding happens video screen capture and audio recordings will be made.

**Data Analysis **

A literature review will inform research design and creation of a thematic coding scheme to analyse pilot workshop observations.

I will use activity theory to analyse interviews of participants in game making communities to prototype activity systems of participants, practices and materials.

A thick approach to data gathering will produce a lot of data including video of stations , good for, general interaction s, screen capture good for

Due to the rich naturalistic nature of the environment I will be looking for key interactions identified in my journal which illustrate transformation moments or have potential to illuminate significant issues identified in participant learning.

The following areas are of particular interest given the background of this study and I anticipate they will be of interest when results are analysed; transformations surrounding attitudes to participation in digital making cultures, impact of learning design in engagement of female participants, complementary role of physical materials in a digital making environment.
