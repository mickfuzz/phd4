**Investigating the potential of multi-generational game making using code playgrounds** ========================================================================================

**Background** --------------

From Papert "epistemological pluralism" is foregrounded. But there are limitations of this focus skewed by technology focus of study around one tool.

Fro example, we can look at learning around constructivist learning environments (jonassen) and see a focus on digital first environments.

What more can we learn about the impact of wider pluralism involving non digital non coding from a design environment highlighting learner control.

Question: What are the implications on learning of genuine learner control and pluralism in a collaborative game making environment?

Participatory culture encompasses various practices and ethos

From participatory culture, I will examine the component of how technologies are appropriated by users. (Bastard culture)

Participatory design, history in product design , techniques overlap with social activism and have created wide

Question. What happens to participants conceptions of technology use when they are involved in game coding and asset creation

**Methodology /framework **

constructivism, focus on social learning and use of objects.

The concepts of Constructionism will be employed as an applied framework to describe educational application of constructivist concepts.

Activity theory as a way of analysing diverse data to represent complexity of learning process.

Also it is the nature of their interactions, power relations, helping behaviour, questioning and problem solving strategies

**Methods**

**Phase one **

Identification of themes of interest and concern to participants via interviews.

Identify suitable activities to incorporate into a learning design as separate activity systems.

Create stations to work on different activities.

-   Video, storytelling, stop motion and web cam

-   Audio, sound effects

-   Graphic, pixel art, backgrounds, drawing equipment.

-   Coding, putting it together.

Set up recording equipment around these stations to record processes.

Looking at recording a rich series of interactions, but selectively

**Phase two **

analysis of interactions to establish roles and mediation in relation to other elements of an activity system.

**Phase three **

I need a question that retrospectively looks at data ant literature

5\. How does engaging in collaborative game making transform conceptions of technology, learning and participation in digital making cultures?
