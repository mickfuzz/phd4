Starting ideas for a Coding Structure-------------------------------------

**Kind of activity **

-   On-Screen game coding using game making software

-   Informal self-playtesting

-   Non-screen design activities

-   Formal Playtesting sessions

-   Unstructured feedback and interaction on games

-   Group Updates / Structured Group Feedback

**Game Patterns - most understandable to game designers**

-   Collisions and power ups / down

-   Win and Lose conditions

-   Jumping on Enemies - greater challenge

-   Collection and transportation

-   Altering Game Space on one level

-   Adding more Levels as a fundamental change to Game Space

-   Adding Lives

-   Player Movement from User Input

-   Non player movement

-   Timer countdown

-   Keys and Doors

**Computational Design Patterns ( including one practices fromresnick)**

-   On Game Creation

    -   Create a starting layout

    -   Set the default behaviours and variable values

-   Events on Input

    -   Player movements

    -   Other input actions

-   Creating and monitoring variables and conditional responses

    -   e.g. key and doors

    -   Adding player health via lives

    -   Use of state design pattern

-   Code Listening blocks

    -   Understanding the game loop

    -   for win/end states

    -   Collisions - e.g player / enemy

-   Remove code redundancy / generalisation

    -   Create own functions

-   Looping through graphical arrays to create or clear layout

**Collaborative Design Practices and Literacies / (also practice fromResnick)**

The following are based around observable behaviour

-   Goal Setting (decision to add a new mechanic, or change space in a    > fundamental way)

    -   Invitation to set new goal or revise existing goals

    -   Participant expressing a new goal to include in game or around        > the wider making experience

    -   Clarification or questions on desired design behaviour

-   Iterative revision of game design, play-testing own work

    -   Smaller revisions, sub goals, seeking game balance

    -   Testing aesthetics of graphics / sound

-   Collaboration during code generation

    -   Refocusing: redirection back to other participants earlier goals

    -   Projection into the ideal player's experience

    -   Remarks on problematic real behaviour

-   Playtesting and feedback on others work

    -   Expression of pride, or fun

    -   Imagining other player's experience

-   Remixing and appropriation of other participants work and ideas

    -   Appropriation without comment or direct copying just taking the        > idea

    -   More direct copying of code via observation or conversation

-   Debugging and different kinds of problems solving

    -   Glitches - code still works but unexpected result (questioning

    -   No errors blank screen, no idea (often retrace steps, go back to        > earlier version, or have to start again)

    -   Clues, greyed out code, red dots, error messages (try to narrow        > down issue, remove sections of code, again go back, try to        > find duplication of code blocks)

**Elements of Systems Thinking\**

Adapted from the work of Torres

-   Identification of Systems Elements

    -   Individual Game Elements

    -   Game Space

    -   Game Mechanics

    -   Game Rules

    -   Game Goals

-   Quality of links between elements

    -   Dynamic system interactions

    -   Static interactions

-   Feedback Loops

    -   Working with feedback loops and changing elements

    -   Recognition of feedback loops

-   Transferrable nature of the systems concepts

    -   Recognition of concept of systems concepts being transferrable

    -   Specific identification of a similar concept in different        > situation

Emerging Criteria for Choosing Critical Incidents - [[compare tothis]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_X1Y7Skdr7pY0wa5RRFeAEa0z0WEOzsvn0ZcqpZPC0/edit#bookmark=id.1obzjeiq44lf)

-   Looking for times of high interaction rather than low

-   simple gesture analysis showing high level of interaction, pointing,    > body language of learning, direction of gaze or movement to others    > workstation

-   Discussions of choice, control, reflection based on possibilities

-   The mention of of design elements to help or hinder desired    > processes
