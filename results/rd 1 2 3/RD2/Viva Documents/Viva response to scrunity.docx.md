Response to Scrutiny - RD2 Viva ===============================

Contribution to Knowledge -------------------------

I imagine contribution could be in one or more of the following ways

1.  Framework of Learning Dimension of a (family) collaborative game     > making environment. This is how the research questions are framed     > at the moment. Thus quite wide including collaboration,     > initiative, (closest framework is that of Bevan et al surrounding     > tinkering frameworks). Thus keep as holistic as workable but by     > necessity curate into a more manageable framework.

2.  A narrower framework of Learning Dimensions focused on computational     > patterns and systems thinking that outcome from use of study's     > toolset and feedback processes / design. This would be a framework     > for recognition, and coding, suitable for the analysis of game     > making using the kind of gaming tools used in this intervention,

3.  Focus on the process to build communities of learners, makers, via     > reflective, iterative expansive processes and tool-sets

4.  A section on methods - including working with 360 camera and     > resulting video data, cross referencing with screen data and audio     > recordings. There may well are particularities about the     > technicalities of this that I can contribute to and their follow     > up implications for understanding evolving research paradigms.

### What's already Present in the Literature

An outline what\'s already there in this area. This can link to coding document which is [[online here.]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/189YsDeDIsvpDOsZaA62FP1iSjpWfMzdlkRe-nXKhVbk/edit#)

**Frameworks for learning dimensions**

-   Resnick and Brennan - wider dimensions of computational thinking

-   Repenning, linked to science simulations - justification

-   Torres - systems thinking

**Processes of intervention based research**

-   Mantle of expert (heathcote) & change laboratory (engestrom)

1)  **A Holistic Framework of (retro)-Game Making Learning Dimensions**

As per Kafai - social and material and cultural dimensions would be included.

Kinds of learning dimensions likely to evolve from my design

-   Computational Thinking concepts / specifics - see Resnick and     > Brennan concepts

-   Digital literacy focus: browser use, code patching, keyboard     > dexterity

-   Roles of family interaction: specifics of parental child interaction     > (as per Roque)

-   Intersection of design and social learning dimensions

The holistic approach It also would also give a linking of the kinds of activities that were being undertaken - and the types of learning or subject of discourse happening at times of different phases of the intervention.

The danger here is over scoping the study, creating a huge coding task with lots of cross referencing, perhaps would suite a better resourced follow up study.

2)  **Game Making Learning Dimensions Framework** ,

For this second one the aim would be to prioritise some of the learning dimensions most suited or particular to game making.

This output asks - What is unique about the object of game making compared to similar creative coding programmes. De-prioritises to some extent the cataloguing of broader social and cultural dimensions.

An advantage would be more specific recommendations for facilitators and designers working in this area. And a more specific look at the interactions between material and social element of the design.

The closest study is Scalable Game Design. There are limits to this.

-   Seems skewed towards transfer Science Simulations, thus     > not-relatable to YoungPeople

-   Excludes mechanics of CT concepts

Start to present the results of my own work in terms of the game making patterns.

For example - GGC Examples created for the second and third iteration of the course outline some of the user generated patterns.

![](media/image2.png){width="5.130208880139983in" height="7.081918197725284in"}

The kind of Game Making patterns above intersect with both the following dimensions

-   Wider concepts: Games as a systems (components, balance, feedback -     > see Torres & Salen) & Computational Patterns (see my coding     > definition based on computing design patterns)

<!-- -->

-   Narrower mechanics: the foundational concepts of coding sequences,     > loops, logic, data ( as per Resnick's first definition of     > "computational concepts")

![](media/image1.png){width="5.109375546806649in" height="4.855543525809273in"}

The resulting implication is that there are design techniques for the designer and teaching techniques for the facilitator to link learner led game patterns and ideas with the wider and narrower patterns.

Design Guidelines

For example the following design guidelines may be suitable

-   Use a learner led approach (thus drawing on their funds of     > knowledge) to source beginning

-   Choose a restricted set of wider (Systems Thinking and patterns),     > and narrower (material-specific) concepts (CT) - orientate your     > language and that of resources around this set

-   Create design briefs, and additional challenges in line with game /     > playful pedagogies linked to the concepts you wish to promote

-   Create feedback opportunities for students to use terms correctly in     > very specific context (second stimulation from Vygotsky)

3)  **A focus on developing a practice base formative research process     > **

The object there which has as its object an evolving community of game makers seems quite interesting. I would be looking at adapting and combining existing paradigms rather than starting from first principles. There at the moment are Change Lab - Engestrom and Mantle of Expert.

This area is only just emerging based on my experiences and reading. Input is welcome. The Following section on building capacity of participants is relevant.

4)  **Development of Video-based Research Methods to study communities     > of digital makers**

A section on methods - including working with 360 camera and resulting video data, cross referencing with screen data and audio recordings. There may well are particularities about the technicalities of this that I can contribute to and their follow up implications for understanding evolving research paradigms.

The process of recording three iterations of programmes has already built my capacity of working with large amounts of data.

I am particularly interested in low-cost approaches to using new forms of technology. I am undertaking this research with only a £120 domestic 360 camera and normal grade laptops for analysis.

Building capacity of participants in Co-design ----------------------------------------------

Agree that this wide "Codesign" of programme seems over ambitious.

What I was getting at what linked to the process of mutual and intentional design and evolution of the programme in a holistic way. However this is beyond the commitment level and interest of the participants. This is more suitable for University to other more institutional or community learning providers where there is mutual benefit and staff are paid.

Instead I will focus on facilitating more proactive contribution to the intentional formation of a community of learners and ongoing communication and sharing of learning that happens as part of and between making sessions.

Uncertainty in this area shows a desire to be led by ideas of design based research / expansive learning / formative interventions / mantle of expert - but to create something that is of particular use to the specifics of this learning situation.

IT'S AN AREA OF ONGOING WORK

Consider Wider Methodologies - Including Gesture ------------------------------------------------

• There's already a lot of data collection happening, I don't want to add more cameras

• Participants are mostly static in key moments of problems solving and interaction, I'm really focusing on their on screen actions and their verbal discourse

• Happy to add in some gesture analysis and recording for key moments captured on the 360 camera that aren't on screen capture, movements around room, who is on the keyboard, broad gestures indicating levels of engagement, facial expressions where appropriate.

• Would really need to redesign the practicalities of gathering data and design follow up activities which encourage explanation of concepts and invite gesture and ways to record this

• Agree that this is an interesting area and this is a good follow up study / side study / but don't want to bite off too much for this thesis
