**Ideas for Blog posts**

**Format **

a\. The aims of the research student's project as detailed in their original application for registration (RD1).

b\. A critical literature review of the findings of other workers in the field of enquiry.

c\. A full description of the methods and/or methodology used.

d\. Details of results obtained. The research student should also indicate how the aims specified in their application for registration (RD1) have been achieved. If these aims have been

altered, the report should indicate how any new aims have been satisfied.

e\. Discussion of the work already undertaken and conclusions drawn at this stage of the work. The relative extent of discussion and conclusions will vary considerably from subject to

subject. If difficulties are experienced, expert advice should be sought from experienced supervisors in the appropriate field.

f\. A full description of the intended further work

***Questions that I'm not going to try to answer / ie include in lit review answer / No go areas***

-   Digital divide ( instead talk of collaborative funds of learning and     > complementary, evolving roles of participation)

<!-- -->

-   Can Family game making may additionally increase family     > communication and bonding in response to fragmented households due     > to separate digital devices

<!-- -->

-   Systems Thinking (instead problem solving)

-   Effectiveness / Impact of X on Y , instead potential, or framework     > of learning dimensions

-   Effect of the physical dimensions of the design on motivation or     > understanding, ie the video game boxes, and the map.

***My Debates over structure of the RD2 Lit review***

Don't try to be clever over the structure follow the guidelines

There's a lot to write about for findings in the field. - May need to skimp a bit on the concepts / terminology section and jump right into the findings.

-   Cover the collaboration, choice only briefly in Lit review,

-   Then findings from the diverse fields, then potential the frameworks

-   Then broad methodology and narrowing down to AT

-   Then results so far, AT diagrams, revision of questions to include     > choice / autonomy

*[Notes on overlap in sections and how to resolve]{.underline}*

-   Resolve design strategies by bringing different sections together at     > end of this part of lit review to identify suitable candidates

-   There's a bit of a split between the section looking at     > collaboration, and choice, with the starting looks at methodology,     > constructivism etc.

-   How to resolve this?? Not sure but try moving around - from version     > 3 to version 4 - changed to move definitions of collaboration /     > choice to methodology - and simplify for

***Big ideas***

***Coding is a STEM shortage,** needed by pipeline, a new digital literacy, good to have understanding of this world to have greater choices, be more informed on digital matters to improve autonomy / efficacy. *

*Bringing cultural funds into learning is needed to widen discorces - referenced in Kafai and RSC. Games provide those funds. *

*There are challenges to doing this - certainly in a new space. And CoPs in schools are very challenging. *

*What factors can be examined to help analyse the kind of social and cultural learning happening. *

-   *Pair interactions, and helping strategies, *

-   *Scaffolding and choice, in design, soft hard, unpicking the terms     > involved, autonomy, *

-   *Collaboration, cooperation, in problem solving and terms involved*

*Digital making is a new area with some but little research in non formal learning areas. *

*Third space, non formal , learning environments have specific characteristics. Don\'t go too far into this, but more guidelines for designing for semi, structured learning experiences are needed. *

*Also designs for informal areas in computing are rare beyond instruction sheets, try to analyse some resources, designs and frameworks, for aiding process. *

**Most specifically , what are elements of negotiation of goals, **

-   Resources, for choice, and limits

-   Learning designs for negotiation of goals

-   Collaborative Problem solving via mediation

-   Analysis of

**On activity theory**

Chat Activity theory is the main research framework.

I locate this research in tradition of socio cultural school of educational theory.

I am not trying to resolve some of e ongoing tensions between personal and culturally focused schools of constructivist theory, see fosnot and o loughin, some of the will be explored as they shed light on key elements

Cultural experience is vital to my research, creating a community, bringing funds of knowledge,

The personal experience is also vital, learning how to code and remix

Chat offers away to wholistic ally remain true to the socio cultural approaches, but enable analysis at an individual level. This is via analysis at different scopes of activity unit size, via focusing on different elements of the interacting elements , say that of norms , and via the concept of expansive learning which enables analysis of change overtime.

There is a lot of flexibility here which suits this emergent study.

From engestrom 2018 , summary

Difference btw broad socio cultural approach and , historicity of at.

**On data collection and analysis**

Via journal, via interviews, via video captures and via 360 camera.

Looking for detail of collaboration , especially maintaining sustained shared thinking

**To integrate in whole night notes 11 May**

~~Add in family as a context and link to Brahms research chapter on family. ~~

Contrast constructivist notion of personal learning as transmission with rigoff and appropriation of practices. The overall focus is on language use and shared meaning, and coding practice appropriation.

Compare the repairs in meaning in teasley, dillengbourg, with conflicts and tensions in at , as a more holistic approach which allows for revision of design and shared cultural artefacts

Give specific example of exploration of community norms in at study on educational game playing programme

A introductory section on design experiments, mutual appropriation and expansion , give brief examples and perhaps come back in results.

Use of the design frameworks for tinkering and resnick as starting point, how appropriate are they?

Expansion present in my decisions to create new mediating tools to address tensions identified.

**Notes on Results**

The coding preferences of Dave are being brought into the design with his involvement, git facilitates this. My participation in open leaders helped make this possible , a possible blog post here. In fact do a host leading up to moz fest.

-   Changes in the length and directiveness of programme

<!-- -->

-   Integration of more non coding elements

-   More consistent use of games and playful approaches to reduce     > anxiety.

-   Reflective elements also playful, more formally included in     > structure, to avoid my over focus on code problems in the moment

-   Coding cheat cheat hacking as an tool output, compare to parents     > with this knowledge , to address frustrations in learners
