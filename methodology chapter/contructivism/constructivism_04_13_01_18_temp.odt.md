 Constructivism and Complex Learning Environments =================================================

This writing covers the foundations and characteristics of the learningtheory of constructivism and explores its relevance to understandingcomplex learning ecologies, such as my study interest of digital gamemaking in intergenerational environments.

Foundations of constructivism-----------------------------

The foundations of constructivism can be usefully contrasted tobehavioural and cognitive learning theories through the lens of theconcept of objectivism. Objectivism in a philosophical context can bedescribed as viewing the reality as external to and independent of thehuman mindJonassen,1991). Applied to a learning context, the behavioural school uses thisperspective to justify for a focus on direct instruction as knowledgesuits direct transmission. Effective learning then is the maximisationof fidelity to the original knowledge which can be tested withoutrecourse to examining the processes of the mind.

While, the cognitive school began to explore mental processes, oftenusing a metaphor of mind as computer. Concepts of informationprocessing, memory and cognitive load became prevalent. Bruner, apioneers of the cognitive movement later questioned the overreliance oncomputer metaphors and subsequent implications for application ineducationBruner,1990). His concern is that the specialisation of cognitivists oninformation capabilities of the mind was detractive from exploring its'meaning-making' capabilities1990,p. 2).

This constructivist focus on meaning-making and a view of knowledge asconstructed rather than received a philosophical break from anobjectivist world, one with significant implications to the design oflearning environmentsJonassen,1991). The foundations of constructivism are outlined in the followingsection.

Outline of key concepts of constructivism-----------------------------------------

To best explore implications for education of a constructivistperspective, fundamental concepts of the theory should be examined. Thisprocess is made more complex by the varieties of schools ofconstructivism. Palincsar explores a tentative spectrum, with aconstructivism rooted in a social construction of reality at one end anda more individually focused view of the construction of knowledge at theother1998).Phillips proposes a three dimensional model of divergences, extendingthe individual/ social focus to incorporate dimensions of publicknowledge and radical nature of knowledge construction, concepts whichare explored in context later in this writingDerry,1996).

Despite this variety, overarching themes of a constructivist view oflearning can be identified. The work of Grabinger and colleagues oncreating rich environments for active learning is instructive in thisaspectGrabingerand Dunlap, 1995; Grabinger et al., 1997).

When describing common features of constructivism, Grabinger and Dunlapidentify three characteristics; knowledge is cumulative and a result ofactive processes, context is used by individuals to personaliseknowledge and the importance of collaboration and social negotiation ofmeaning. These themes are now explored in more depth.

Active nature of knowledge creation

The interrelated concepts of puzzlement, perturbment and disequilibriumare used to explore the active view of knowledge construction prevalentin foundational constructivist theoryDewey,1938; Piaget, 1954; Savery and Duffy, 1995). Piaget described knowledgeis an active process where the learner constructs knowledge usingevolving cognitive structures. In his view dis-equilibrium occurred whenmental structures were no longer viable for the learner in response tonew experiences. Piaget referred to these structures as schema, whichcan be described as mental frames grouping together understanding of andreactions to around concepts and situations. Piaget's understanding ofschema can be contrasted to a more inclusive definition favoured ininformation processing / cognitive science circles were schemas aresmaller in scope and including memory objects and mental modelsDerry,1996).

Schema facilitate the processing and storing of information. Whenexperiences being processed is experienced as in 'dis-equilibrium' withexisting schema, then a process of 'accommodation' is said to happen,resulting in an updated and more complex schema. Experiences not incontradiction with the existing schema, are integrated in a processPiaget described as 'assimilation'. Von Glasefeld highlights theinaccuracy of a view of assimilation as a passive process where schemataare seen as a containers for knowledgevonGlasersfeld, 1998). Instead Piaget's conception of a schema as a'cohesive, repeatable action sequence'1952,p. 240) is emphasised. The concept of viability introduced to clarifythat the restructuring of the schema does not bring the learner closerto an objective reality but one which can be said to be more 'viable'within the learners social contextvonGlasersfeld, 1998, p. 9)

The active process of knowledge creation is also identified by Duffy andSavery who redefine Piaget's dis-equilibrium as puzzlement and citevonGlaserfeld's assertion that the people and environment surrounding usprovide the greatest source of such perturbationvonGlasersfeld, 1998). The importance of context is explored in the nextsection.

Situated nature of knowledge creation

In the framework of constructivism, knowledge is viewed as situated,that is, knowledge best is linked with specific and authenticcontextsCollinset al., 1988). Brown and colleagues talk of 'inert knowledge'accumulated by learners able to perform , for example, rotetransformations of figures with out the ability to use such proceduresusefully in the context from which they are derived1989,p. 33). Inert knowledge can be compare to learning concepts viaauthentic contexts and associated tools which they assert allows aricher, more complex understanding and reproducibility of knowledge. Theauthours describe an indexicalising of knowledge, reflecting a complexconstruction of links between context and the mental models constructed,thus a similar context require to allow reapplication or reuse of thelearning. The primacy of context has wide ranging implications forlearning environments which are explored in the final section of thiswriting.

Collaboration and social negotiation of meaning

The importance of context forms a foundation for a further strand ofconstructivism identified by Grabinger, the socially negotiated natureof knowledge and the importance of collaboration in the process. Theseconcepts are now briefly explored through an examination of fundamentalconcepts of the sociocultural theory of Vygotsky and its influence onthe wider the cultural-historical school of psychologyPalincsar,1998).

For Vygotsky the role of context is extended beyond its impact on the(acknowledged) internal construction of knowledge of individual toencompass the joint creation of a cultural context by its participantsColeand Wertsch, 1996). For example, the previously mentioned concept ofviability depends on the existence of a social environment which allowsthe relative testing of such viability. This environment, and itsassociated tools, norms and processes are socially constructed throughon-going negotiation and active participation of its participants.

These tools and processes are referred to as artefacts. The interactionof present and past participants are seen to create historical andcultural artefacts that compose authentic environments and thuspossibility for deep, contextualised learningBrownet al., 1989). The view of tools and symbolic artefacts as mediating thelearning process is key to a constructivist view of higher mentalprocesses, such as language use or problem solvingColeand Wertsch, 1996; Cunningham and Duffy, 1996; Vygotsky, 1978). Thiscontinued co-construction of the learning environment has significantimplications for educational design which are explored in the followingsection.

Application of concepts to educational settings-----------------------------------------------

Since initial interest of constructivist concepts they have beenevaluated and recombined in a number of education focused responses andframeworks. Many researchers have integrated and evolved aims from thefield Instructional (Systems) Design to create a rich seam of literatureand studies around constructivist learning environments and their thepossibilities offered by emerging tools and technologiesJonassenet al., 1996; Jonassen and Mandl, 1990; Mcmahon, 1997; Wilson, 1996).Other researchers have identified approaches which map underlyingconstructivist concepts to application in digital game playing andmaking communitiesGee,2003; Kafai and Burke, 2015).

Duffy and Cunningham's identify responses to apply a constructivistapproach on the design of educational environments, namely; discoverylearning, zone of proximal development. scaffolding, cognitiveapprenticeship, coaching, learner control, assessment and collaborativelearning1996).I have prioritised the following areas to explore in more detail drawingon the literature base described in the previous paragraph; learnercontrol, context and collaborative learning.

***Maximise ****Learn****er**** Control***

Duffy and Cunningham initially situate learner control through the lensof computer enhanced instruction. Learner control can be contrasted tocomputer control. Learners control the sequence of information andtasks.

Wilson characterises constructivist learning environments as opensystems where learner choice is emphasisedWilson,1995). However, rather than deemphasising the importance of teacher ordesigner input, he asserts that this open nature can tend to chaos andeventually de-motivation of learners and thus good design is needed ineach component of that system and in the linkages to help maintainlearner activityWilson,1995).

Hannafin and Lee identify student autonomy as a key factor in learnermotivation, performance and creativity, as outlined by selfdetermination theoryDeciand Ryan, 2000; Lee and Hannafin, 2016). From them learner autonomy doesnot require participant to have created projects from scratch, they mayhave chosen from a range of predetermined choices, however 'endorsement'of activities is key. Endorsement is described as

Place Learning in Authentic Contexts

Given the constructivist understanding of the indexical nature ofknowledge and effective recall, learning contexts should be as close orideally identical to the target domain of use of the skills being learntBrownet al., 1989). For example, Duffy and Savery note a disconnect betweenthe kind of work a scientist does and the operations they perform andthose required in a science lessonSaveryand Duffy, 1995).

The importance of authentic context presents a challenge to classroombased instruction that many initiatives attempt to overcome. Theseinclude cognitive apprenticeship and student centred learning (SCL). SCLis family of design strategies which highlight an emphasis on activelearner research in inquiry-based learning, a focus on simulations anddynamic case-studies of problem-based learning, and the studentgeneration of artefacts or activities in project-based learningLeeand Hannafin, 2016)

Duffy and Cunningham are critical of cognitive apprenticeship, acoaching model. While they support the proximity to an authenticcontext, it focus on a unidirectional transmission of skills from masterto apprentice and is thus less attractive than a more mutual learningprocess that genuine participation in a community would enableCunninghamand Duffy, 1996; Wenger, 1998).

Grabinger and Dunlap cite the importance of authentic contexts tocontribute to increased student ownership of challenges addressed andthat genuine challenge in team work encourages desireable student'collaboration and negotiation'1995,p. 21).

Gee notes implications for learning surrounding the embodied and thusauthentic context provided by good digital gamesGee,2003, p. 83). As meanings in video games are grounded in real situationsthis facilitates the acquisition of complex language and concepts inways teaching of inert knowledge do not.

Facilitate Collaborative Learning

The role of collaborative learning builds on the importance of authenticcontexts and motivation engendered in the previous two sections to add asocial element of learning based on dialogue. Vygotsky asserted that"the social dimension of consciousness is primary"1979,p. 30). Two resulting concepts which are of import to learning designersare firstly scaffolding, where instructional or designed supportsfacilitate early learning attempts and secondly the zone of proximaldevelopment where learners are able to perform more advanced tasksthrough peer interaction, must be considered to create an effectiveconstructivist learning environment .

Duffy and Savery outline the importance of designing a environments thatallow for support and challenges to participants thinking. Facilitatingprocees for peer feedback and interaction is key to this challengeSaveryand Duffy, 1995).

Gee outlines concept of 'affinity groups' in games playing cultures.Group members share an understanding of the symbols and cultural normsof a share area of interest2003,p. 27). The concept gradually increasing, genuine participation in ofcommunity of practice provides a framework to explain the process ofmoving from outsider to insider of such a groupLave,1991; Wenger, 1998). Kafai underlines the importance of affinity groupsand communities of practice in reference to game making communities,noting particularly the possibilities for interaction and peer learningthrough over shared digital artefacts and processes in real and onlinecommuntiesKafaiet al., 2016).
