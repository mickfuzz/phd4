 Constructivism and Complex Learning Environments =================================================

This writing covers the foundations and characteristics ofconstructivism. It also explores its relevance to understanding complexlearning ecologies, such as my study interest of digital game making inintergenerational environments.

Foundations of constructivism-----------------------------

The foundations of constructivism can be usefully contrasted tobehavioural and cognitive learning theories through the lens of theconcept of objectivism. Objectivism in a philosophical context can bedescribed as viewing reality as external to and independent of the humanmind (Jonassen, 1991). Applied to a learning context, the behaviouralschool uses this perspective to justify a focus on teacher instruction,with knowledge suited to direct transmission. Effective learningmaximises fidelity to the original knowledge which should be testedwithout recourse to examining the processes of the mind.

From these foundations, a cognitive school of psychology began toexplore mental processes, often using a metaphor of mind as computer.Concepts of information processing, memory and cognitive load becameprevalent. Bruner, a pioneer of the cognitive movement later questionedthe overreliance on computer metaphors and subsequent implications forapplication in education (1990). His concern was that the specialisationof cognitivists on the information processing of the mind divertedattention from exploring its 'meaning-making' capabilities (1990, p. 2).

This constructivist focus on meaning-making, encompassing a view ofknowledge as constructed rather than received, marks a philosophicalbreak from an objectivist worldview, one with significant implicationsto the design of learning environments (Jonassen, 1991). Characteristicsof constructivism are outlined in the following section.

Outline of key concepts of constructivism-----------------------------------------

To best explore implications for education of a constructivistperspective, fundamental concepts of the theory should be examined. Thisprocess is made more complex by the varieties of schools ofconstructivism. Palincsar explores a tentative spectrum, with aconstructivism rooted in a social construction of reality at one end anda more individually focused view of the construction of knowledge at theother (1998). Phillips proposes a three dimensional model ofdivergences, extending the individual/ social focus to incorporatedimensions of public knowledge and radical nature of knowledgeconstruction(Derry, 1996). These concepts are explored in context laterin this writing.

Despite this variety, overarching themes of a constructivist view oflearning can be identified. The work of Grabinger and colleagues oncreating rich environments for active learning is instructive in thisaspect (Grabinger and Dunlap, 1995; Grabinger et al., 1997).

When describing common features of constructivism, Grabinger and Dunlapidentify three characteristics; knowledge is cumulative and a result ofactive processes, context is used by individuals to personaliseknowledge and the importance of collaboration and social negotiation ofmeaning. These themes are now explored in more depth.

### Active nature of knowledge creation

The interrelated concepts of puzzlement, perturbment and disequilibriumare used to explore the active view of knowledge construction prevalentin foundational constructivist theory (Dewey, 1938; Piaget, 1954; Saveryand Duffy, 1995). Piaget described knowledge as an active process wherethe learner constructs knowledge using evolving cognitive structures.Dis-equilibrium occurs when mental structures are no longer viable forthe learner in response to new experiences. Piaget described thesestructures as schemata (singular schema), which can be described asmental frames grouping together understanding of, and reactions toconcepts and situations. Piaget's understanding of schemata can becontrasted to a more inclusive definition favoured in informationprocessing / cognitive science circles where a schema is smaller inscope and can comprise a variety of memory objects and mental models(Derry, 1996).

Schemata facilitate the processing and storing of information. Whenexperiences processed are experienced as being in 'dis-equilibrium' withexisting schema, there is conflict and a dynamic, restructuring processof accommodation is said to happen, resulting in an updated and morecomplex schema. Experiences not in contradiction with existing schemata,are integrated in a process Piaget described as assimilation. VonGlasefeld highlights the inaccuracy of a view of assimilation as apassive process where schemata are seen as a containers for knowledge(von Glasersfeld, 1998). Instead Piaget's conception of a schema as a'cohesive, repeatable action sequence' (1952, p. 240) is emphasised. Theconcept of viability introduced to clarify that the restructuring of theschema does not bring the learner closer to an objective reality but onewhich can be said to be more 'viable' within the learners social context(von Glasersfeld, 1998, p. 9)

The active process of knowledge creation is also identified by Duffy andSavery who emphasise learner focus on an element of their environment asa key factor of what learning will occur (Savery and Duffy, 1995). Theyrecast Piaget's dis-equilibrium as puzzlement and cite vonGlaserfeld'sassertion that the people and environment surrounding us provide thegreatest source of such perturbation (von Glasersfeld, 1998). Theimportance of context is explored in the next two sections.

### Situated nature of knowledge creation

Constructivism views knowledge as situated, that is, knowledge is mosteffective when linked with specific and authentic contexts(Collins etal., 1988). Brown and colleagues talk of 'inert knowledge' accumulatedby learners able to perform , for example, rote transformations offigures without the ability to use such procedures usefully in thecontext from which they are derived (1989, p. 33). Inert knowledge canbe compared to learning concepts via authentic contexts and tools whichthe authours assert allow a richer, more complex understanding andreproducibility of knowledge. An indexicalising of knowledge isdescribed, reflecting a complex construction of links between contextand the contents of mental models created, thus similar contexts arerequired to allow reapplication or reuse of the learning.

### Collaboration and social negotiation of meaning

Context underpins a further strand of constructivism identified byGrabinger, the socially negotiated nature of knowledge and theimportance of collaboration in the process. These concepts are nowbriefly explored through an examination o fthe sociocultural theory ofVygotsky (Palincsar, 1998).

For Vygotsky the role of context is extended beyond its impact on theinternal construction of knowledge of individual, which he acknowledges,to encompass the joint creation of a cultural context by itsparticipants (Cole and Wertsch, 1996). For example, the previouslymentioned concept of viability depends on the existence of a socialenvironment which allows the relative testing of such viability. Thisenvironment, and its associated tools, norms and processes are sociallyconstructed through on-going negotiation and active participation of itsparticipants.

These tools and processes are referred to as artefacts. The interactionof present and past participants are seen to create historical andcultural artefacts that compose authentic environments and thuspossibility for deep, contextualised learning (Brown et al., 1989). Theview of tools and symbolic artefacts as mediating the learning processis key to a constructivist view of higher mental processes, such aslanguage use or problem solving (Cole and Wertsch, 1996; Cunningham andDuffy, 1996; Vygotsky, 1978). This continued co-construction of thelearning environment has significant implications for educational designwhich are explored in the following section.

Application of concepts to educational settings-----------------------------------------------

Constructivist concepts have been evaluated and recombined in a numberof responses and frameworks with the aim of reforming educationalprovision. Many researchers have integrated and evolved aims from thefield Instructional (Systems) Design to create a rich seam of literatureand studies around constructivist learning environments and their thepossibilities offered by emerging tools and technologies (Jonassen etal., 1996; Jonassen and Mandl, 1990; Mcmahon, 1997; Wilson, 1996). Otherresearchers have identified approaches which map underlyingconstructivist concepts to application in digital game playing andmaking communities (Gee, 2003; Kafai and Burke, 2015).

Duffy and Cunningham identify responses to apply a constructivistperspective to the design of wider educational environments, namely;discovery learning, zone of proximal development. scaffolding, cognitiveapprenticeship, coaching, authentic assessment and context, learnercontrol, and collaborative learning (1996). Based on the focus of mystudy, I have prioritised the following areas to explore in more detaildrawing on the literature base described in the previous paragraph;learner control, authentic context and collaborative learning.

***Maximise Learner Control***

Duffy and Cunningham initially situate the concept of learner control incomputer enhanced instruction where it is contrasted to computer controlof the sequence of information and tasks. Given that autonomy andlearner control pose significant challenges for designers significantly,how can this extra work be justified?

Hannafin and Lee identify student autonomy as a key factor in learnermotivation, performance and creativity, as outlined by selfdetermination theory (Deci and Ryan, 2000; Lee and Hannafin, 2016). Forthem learner autonomy does not require participants to have createdprojects from scratch. They may have chosen from a range ofpredetermined choices, however endorsement of activities is key.Endorsement is described as a shift from an external motivated locus ofmotivation to an internal one on the part of the learner. Plainlyspeaking, the learner doesn't have to have generated a process to buy into it.

Wilson characterises constructivist learning environments as opensystems where learner choice is emphasised (1995). However, rather thandeemphasising the importance of teacher or designer input, he assertsthat this open nature can tend to chaos and eventually the de-motivationof learners; therefore, good design is needed for each component of thatsystem and in the linkages to help maintain learner activity.

***Place Learning in Authentic Contexts***

Due to the indexical nature of knowledge and effective recall, learningcontexts should be as close or ideally identical to the target domain ofuse of the skills being learnt (Brown et al., 1989). For example, Duffyand Savery note a disconnect between the kind of work a scientist does,the nature of operations they perform and those required in a sciencelesson (Savery and Duffy, 1995).

The importance of authentic context presents a challenge to classroombased instruction that many initiatives, including cognitiveapprenticeship and student centred learning (SCL), aim to address.. SCLis family of design strategies which highlight; an emphasis on activelearner research in inquiry-based learning, a focus on simulations anddynamic case-studies of problem-based learning, and the studentgeneration of authentic artefacts or activities in project-basedlearning (Lee and Hannafin, 2016)

Duffy and Cunningham are critical of cognitive apprenticeship, acoaching model. While they support its aim of proximity to an authenticcontext, its focus on a unidirectional transmission of skills frommaster to apprentice and is less attractive than a more mutual learningprocess that genuine participation in a community would enable(Cunningham and Duffy, 1996; Wenger, 1998).

Grabinger and Dunlap cite the importance of authentic contexts tocontribute to increased student ownership of challenges addressed andthat genuine challenge in team work encourages desireable student'collaboration and negotiation' (1995, p. 21).

Gee notes implications for learning surrounding the embodied and thusauthentic context provided by effective digital games (Gee, 2003, p.83). As meanings in video games are grounded in real (game) situations,participation facilitates the acquisition of complex language andconcepts in ways that teaching of inert knowledge does not.

***Facilitate Collaborative Learning***

Vygotsky asserted that "the social dimension of consciousness isprimary" (1979, p. 30). Two resulting concepts of relevance are*scaffolding*, where instructional or designed supports facilitate earlylearning attempts and secondly *the zone of proximal development* wherelearners are able to perform more advanced tasks through peerinteraction. These should be considered to create an effectiveconstructivist learning environment .

Duffy and Savery outline the importance of designing a environments thatallow for support and challenges to participants thinking (1995).Facilitating procedures for peer feedback and interaction is key to thischallenge.

Gee describes 'affinity groups' in game playing cultures where groupmembers share an understanding of the symbols and cultural norms of anarea of interest (2003, p. 27). The concept of gradually increasing,genuine participation in a community of practice provides a framework todescribe the process of moving from outsider to insider of such a group(Lave, 1991; Wenger, 1998). Kafai underlines the importance of affinitygroups and communities of practice in reference to game makingcommunities, noting particularly the possibilities for interaction andpeer learning through the creating and sharing of digital artefacts andprocesses in physical and online communities (Kafai et al., 2016).
