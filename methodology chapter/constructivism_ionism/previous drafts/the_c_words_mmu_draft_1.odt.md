Notes on Methodology  ---------------------

If there is space include notes on the research methodology of Piaget, Papert and socio-cultural schools. What does this say about their underlying assumptions. Ackermann addresses this indirectly in her characterisation of the three in Ackermann, n.d.).  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Constructivism** ** -------------------

We can see the Constructionist approach of Papert as rooted in Constructivist learning theories as proposed by Piaget. Constructivism in this context refers to a view of the learning process as an active process where the learner constructs knowledge using evolving cognitive structures. We can examine some of the concepts and background to this school of thought.

We can see Piaget work as intertwined with the a reaction against the limits of Behaviourism seen by many as a Cognitive Revolution Miller, 2003). The behaviourist approach to psychology had a focus on empirical observation of measurable behaviour rather than mental processes and thus took place in strictly controlled environments. In this context the overall tag of cognitive is a signifier for mental activity rejected by Behaviourists.

While positioning the advancement of cognitive approaches as a revolution is in danger of ignoring activity exploring the realms of mental activity in Europe, particularly Gestalt psychology. In the US from 1950s onwards there was a growth of studies with such a cognitive focus on information processing and phenomenology. The research methods used by Piaget of naturalistic observation

Piaget's Constructivism through a Philosophical Lens

Cavet that this area is outside my comfort zone but clearly a more detailed exploration of it is in order as...

Piaget has been interpreted as a realist but this contested highly Richards and Von Glasersfeld, 1980).

Also constructivism is an alternative to both rationalism/nativism and empiricism. <http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_constructivism.html>

There are strong links to Kant in the content

Attempts to place Piaget in a school of philosophy prove elusive as this is not his focus.

Piaget has been credited with evolution of epistemology from a branch of philosophy to as science in its own right.

This tactic is perhaps best illustrated in Piaget's quote "Je m'en fou de la realite" Gruber and Voneche, 1995, p. xxiv). The authors take this to be a reflection on the work Piaget has one in translating difficult ontological questions into epistemological concerns that are more easily

addressed by educators.

However, we do need to explore some underlying philosophical concepts before being able to fully grasp the concept of how knowledge is created. (or do we can they be integrated? - probably as too lengthy otherwise)

-   First, empiricism, (piaget very anti empiricism -- too simplistic),     knowledge isn't transmitted it's constructed) -   Nativism

Underlying Concepts of Piaget's Constructivism

We can then explore the nature of interactionism as an underlying, uncontroversial characteristic shared with other theorists. However for Piaget the process is much more active than for others. A simplistic interaction with environment resulting in frictionless empirical learning is something Piaget would reject.

We can now explore constructivism as an active process involving assimilation, accomodation into evolving structures.

In their initial directions, assimilation and accommodation are obviously opposed to one another, since assimilation is conservative and tends to subordinate the environment to the organism as it is, whereas accommodation is the source of changes and bends the organism to the successive constraints of the environment. Piaget, 2013)

Distinction from strict nativism

We can make a distinction between a progression of underlying structures and stages which the learner is constantly creating and a set of a priori stages which unfurl as the child ages. This distinguishes Piaget's constructivism from a more nativist approach is subtle especially due to Piagets' claim that they are Universal. Rather they are a seen as a logical progression Gruber and Voneche, 1995, p. xxxix).
