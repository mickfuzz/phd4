Introduction ------------

[]{#anchor}The key word of constructionism is popular when describing game building.

Less so for game playing and making. What are underpinning concepts of a constructionist approach to game making. This writing traces the genesis of the term from in Papert's Mindstorm. The specifics of the underpinning concepts of constructionism are the pivot for this writing. Before this we explore the foundations of constructionism in the constructivism of Piaget and the landscape at the time of this formation, linking with foundational concepts in the contemporary cognitive revolution

Then we explores elaborations of constructionism in more contemporary studies and make some comparisons to methodologies with a social/cultural focus.

Genesis of ideas in work with Piaget, often references constructivism as base for constructionism. As such this wring starts with an exploration on Piaget's view of knowledge construction.

Constructivism** ** -------------------

We can see the Constructionist approach of Papert as rooted in Constructivist learning theories as proposed by Piaget. Constructivism in this context refers to a view of the learning process as an active process where the learner constructs knowledge using evolving cognitive structures.

We can contrast this with wider applied views of constructivist educational approach where which prithe learner has an active role. This approach has many varients, an exploration of which is outside of the scope of this writing. See see Duffy & Cunningham, 1996, for a review).

To shed light on the influence of Piaget's constructivism on Papert we can examine some of the legacy of the effect of methodology and key concepts .

Methodology

We can see Piaget work as intertwined with the a reaction against the limits of Behaviourism seen by many as a Cognitive Revolution Miller, 2003). The behaviourist approach to psychology had a focus on empirical observation of measurable behaviour rather than mental processes and thus took place in strictly controlled environments. In this context the overall tag of cognitive is a signifier for mental activity rejected by Behaviourists.

While positioning the advancement of cognitive approaches as a revolution is in danger of ignoring activity exploring the realms of mental activity in Europe, particularly Gestalt psychology. In the US from 1950s onwards there was a growth of studies with such a cognitive focus on information processing and phenomenology. The research methods used by Piaget of naturalistic observation

Key concepts of Piaget's Constructivism

Attempts to place Piaget in a school of philosophy prove elusive as this is not his focus. Piaget has been credited with evolution of epistemology from a branch of philosophy to as science in its own right. However given that so much of his work was to do with the active reconstruction of reality in the minds of the learner, what can we make Piaget's quote "Je m'en fou de la realite" Gruber and Voneche, 1995, p. xxiv). Gruber and Vonecher take this to be a reflection on the work Piaget has one in translating difficult ontological questions into epistemological concerns that are more easily addressed by educators.

[]{#anchor-1}Define piagets epistemology, one to do with knowledge creation or growth, compared with other epistemologies concerning validity Papert, 1980, p. 163).

We can then explore the nature of interactionism as an underlying, uncontroversial characteristic shared with other theorists. However for Piaget the process is much more active than for others. A simplistic interaction with environment resulting in frictionless empirical learning is something Piaget would reject.

We can now explore constructivism as an active process involving assimilation, accomodation into evolving structures.

In their initial directions, assimilation and accommodation are obviously opposed to one another, since assimilation is conservative and tends to subordinate the environment to the organism as it is, whereas accommodation is the source of changes and bends the organism to the successive constraints of the environment. Piaget, 2013)

We can make a distinction between a progression of underlying structures and stages which the learner is constantly creating and a set of a priori stages which unfurl as the child ages. This distinguishes Piaget's constructivism from a more nativist approach is subtle especially due to Piagets' claim that they are Universal. Rather they are a seen as a logical progression Gruber and Voneche, 1995, p. xxxix).

Papert's Constructionism : **Celebrating the Concrete** -------------------------------------------------------

Difference in focus of Papert's approach.

Ackermann's exploration of the similarities between constructionism and constructivism places Papert's focus on the way learners identify and accommodate new information thus creating new internal representations of the world.

Less to do with equilibrium. More to do dynamics

While Piaget liked to describe the genesis of internal mental stability in terms of successive plateaus of equilibrium, Papert is interested in the dynamics of change Ackermann, 2001, p. 8).

Overall lamented the focus on Piaget's stages and representations of these structures in equilibrium as he thought it detracted from the more extensive and detailed studies of the more dynamic stages of concrete discovery.

This writing goes on to describe particular areas of interest to Papert in the construction of learning environments that facilitated concrete explorations in students. While is would be logical to first cover overarching concepts and then explore how these are put into practice in more specific design principles, Papert's tendency to refuse to abstract away principles make this tricky to do.

Objects to think with

Why important for video game construction

Papert's interest in the educational value of the production of digital artefacts as objects drove the creation of the LOGO coding language some associated physical tools, notably drawing turtles.

For this study Papert's concept of Microworld is of particular interest. Microworlds are designed spaces which act as incubators for certain kinds of learning. His criteria for Microworlds are that they should give examples of the chosen subject learning, bring all needed concepts inside the Microworld and that there should be footholds for the end user to put this kind of learning to use with interaction with the world Papert, 1980, p. 126).

It must comply to the learning principle that for a concept to progress beyond making links to your existing knowledge, you must use it, play with it to find out more and assimilate or accommodate your findings into your world view Ackermann, 2001).

Evocative Objects

The importance of objects goes beyond the cognitive affordances

Affect

Objects that can be shared.

Maker spaces designed to highlight the physical interactions and facilitate peer learning.

Hard and Soft approaches

Of particular interest to this study are the concept of soft and hard approaches to coding Papert, 1990). Whereas a hard approach infers a top down perspective mirrored by recent conceptions of computational thinking Wing, 2008), soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner directed connection with the materials or digital artefacts involved, a connection evoking Levi Strauss' concept of bricolage 1962).

Exploring Social aspects of Constructionism -------------------------------------------

There are aspects of Papert's observations of the social and situated aspects of learning earning communities which show links with socio-cultural schools of learning. We can examine the example of a Samba School where he describes the learning opportunties theme based, communal project undertaken by a community of learners and teachers Zagal and Bruckman, 2005).

While we can see that Papert's focus on the concrete, non-abstract knowledge is sympathetic to the idea of situated learning, he should not be seen as in accordance with an entirely externally situated view of cognition and he would "allow the situating of knowledge in internalized, mental environments to act in much the same way as situated in external, physical environments Harel and Papert, 1990).

As Papert's ethnographic studies show he is highly concerned with the content of the knowledge and the learning journey of individuals as they overcome obstacles and find ways to accommodate new understandings Ackermann, n.d.).

Constructionism and Legacy of Design Focus ------------------------------------------

Constructionism has been adopted and extended particularly by community of practitioners based at MIT whose primary focus is computational technologies in education. Kafai and Resnick have been particularly influential in promoting an adapted version of Constructionism applied to the design and study of computational environments Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996).

The direction of travel here has been to bring in computational thinking

Also to develop the sophistication and the user friendly nature of the design heuristics presented.

We can compare

Resnick et al develop the process of designing a software tool to facilitate a constructivist approach into a framework containing an analogy to building design 2005). Such a tool should have wide walls catering for diverse interests, a low threshold to allow for novices with little technical experience and high ceilings so learners are not restricted by the technical limits of the creative environment as their designs become more complex. * *

*I would develop this more if there were a greater word count to discuss their framework outlined below.\ Immediate Feedback: See the result, see the process\ Fluid Experimentation: Easy to get started, easy to connect,\ Open Exploration: Variety of materials, variety of genres *

Resnick and Rosenbaum also discuss 'tinkering with tinkerability', detailing facilitation guidelines to support the open learning processes. These include; set themes not challenges, highlight diverse examples, tinker with space, encouraging engagement with people, posing questions instead of giving answers and combining diving in with stepping back 2013, pp. 17--19). They identify this as an area for further research.

Papert and Methodology  -----------------------

What is is what it isn't -- More of a meta theory than a learning theory in itself - Hoban et al., 2010)

Summary of the Elemental and Systems based approaches Sawyer, 2014).

Compare to Piaget Methodology. Both heavily focusing on observation and clinical interviews. Papert defends and seems to celebration the anecdotal nature of his research with subject learning entangled with the complex learning environment.

We can be sympathetic with this opposition to a technocentrist viewpoint. His critique of the methodology of isolating factors like the introduction of LOGO to schools from other more environmental aspects are convincing. Given the emergent medium, Papert's contestation that the introduction of computers allows for radical new ways of learning about subjects and that thus multiple factors a necessity in observing change appears valid Papert, 1987).

Accordingly, Papert argues strongly for an ethnographic approach - which he compares to the derogotory 'anecdoctal' word  as a way of removing a reductionist approach Papert, 1990).

However there is also validity in critism that wider methods would be beneficial in the exploration of the effects of microworlds like LOGO on learners Walker, 1987). Certainly an approach using mixed methods would be welcome beyond pure ethnographic interpretation which is common to much of his dissemination of research.
