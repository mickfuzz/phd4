### New Notes on structure of the chapter

This chapter will discuss the uses of GDPs outlined in the previous chapter in relation to

1. Rising to concrete ; Conceptions of abstract and concrete present in computing and digital making research: ultimately, proposing design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework compared to computational thinking.

2. Socio cultural understandings of mediation and agency via TADS  theory,  particularly in relation to the abstract and concrete.

4. Synthesis in relation to  Issues of inclusive pedagogy. UDL, UMC, MOE.  This  underline the entire motivation and design of the study. Returning therefore to a fundamental point of the study to explore how this help diverse learners in a challenging area to learn.

To do this chapter continues to explore the context of the study's emergent cultural and community activity, deepens discussion on interpersonal activity and implications for dimensions of tool use on learner agency in a way which at times addresses wider aspects of the learning design than GDPs.

- impact of side missions / maker types: keep some elements, importance of identity given Gutierrez's focus.  

### Old Notes on structure of the chapter

Following Chapter 6's presentation findings on how participants use GDPs, this chapter contains further discussion on this use GDPs ,
particularly in reference to the building of agency?

To do so at time the focus is widened to include discussion on the evolving setting of use - in particular playtesting and the design processes involved.  

The chapter contains a discussion on wider concerns of designing for learner agency. Here I synthesise analysis on processes which support learners to develop agency in this game making community
(and the role of different levels of authenticity?)

The lens of inclusion and the alignment with UDL is also relevant within an analysis of the discussion of concrete and abstract frameworks.


Additionally, because of the relevance of x and y  in the process,

The role of the emerging culture and identity of the idioculture  is developed in this chapter in the following ways:

- playtesting as a social process; play testing and embodied participation in the games of others - community concepts and norming behaviour emerging during playtesting

- the impact / if any of the social missions and player types to help the development of learner identities.

- the emergence and nurturing of flexible and complex design behaviours (beyond player types)

Some sections here including discussion on element of the introduced side missions explore how facilitators can encourage emergent processes as part of an introduced design. This discussion chapter uses this conceptual spectrum as a way to explore an analysis of different aspects of agency aand inclusive pedagogies.

## Introduction

The previous chapters have explored both designed and fortuitous changes to the learning design that become adopted by the community.

1. Rising to concrete ; Conceptions of abstract and concrete present in computing and digital making research: ultimately, proposing design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework compared to computational thinking.

2. Socio cultural understandings of mediation and agency via TADS  theory,  particularly in relation to the abstract and concrete.

3. TAS, 3rd Spaces, Col, Fok, idiocultures etc.

4. Synthesis in relation to  Issues of inclusive pedagogy. UDL, UMC, MOE.  This  underline the entire motivation and design of the study. Returning therefore to a fundamental point of the study to explore how this help diverse learners in a challenging area to learn.

To do this chapter continues to explore the context of the study's emergent cultural and community activity, deepens discussion on interpersonal activity and implications for dimensions of tool use on learner agency in a way which at times addresses wider aspects of the learning design than GDPs.




This section takes a step back to explore the wider perspectives of the findings beyond the immediate context to digital making and project based approaches and understandings of design patterns in educational contexts.


In this (second) discussion section, I:

- explore the uses of GDPs in relation to varied conceptions of abstraction, chiefly CHAT and CT

- propose that GDPs provide a suitable way to engage with coding practices partly due to their position between abstract computational concepts and concrete implementations of code structures.

- metaphors / frameworks to envisage affordences and particpant agency in CHAT framework. and why this is useful for facilitators and as an accessibel way to share findings.

- explore potential implications for facilitators and researchers on use of GDP collection as an  intermediate pedagogical construct.

- add in a lens of UDL as a helpful framework to design for varied experience, opening in up diverse affordences.

**more intro material**

An underlying proposal of this thesis is the development of  learner agency can be facilitated by designing effective learning environments. To do this I draw on key forms of developmental agency explored in Chapter 3.

This section synthesises findings learner agency in relation to existing conceptions of agency in other research.

This section explores these academic conceptions in a playful way using relatable metaphors from related research. The aim of this playful/relatable approach is to aid the situation of later recommendations for researchers and educators working in this area in an accessible way.

## Part one - Exploring concepts of abstract and concrete knowledge frameworks in relation to Game Design Patterns


1. Recap, GDPs as a Germ cell,
2. Exploring CHAT concepts of abstraction
3. Locating TADS in this perspective, via 3GAT concept of expansion via double stimulation and TADS

This section ends/begins with an proposal of GDPs as a mid-level construct, demonstrating their utility for both educational designers and researchers.


### Recap

MOVE?
In chapter two I described the characteristics and limits of computational thinking as a pedagogical framework, specifically concepts include: varied interpretations; the role of levels of abstraction for teachers and learners; and the value of epistemological pluralism as a way to value concrete approaches.

GDPs as a germ cell,

Move TADs here as recap, as a way to make link to double stimulation.


### Design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework (compared to computational thinking)

This direction of the findings of the last chapter, support findings on design patterns in other contexts as a middle ground between abstract CT concepts and more concrete techniques.

    In order to be useful, patterns must present an abstraction of good practice at a meaningful level of granularity. Formulations that are too abstract will be impractical in real design use; those that are too specific will be difficult to re-use in new scenarios.[@dearden_pattern_2006, p. 20]

Such an interpretation is adopted by Eriksson and colleagues using gameplay design patterns with young people [-@eriksson_using_2019] which drew inspiration from the value of design patterns as a form of "intermediate-level concept" as advocated by fellow researchers as a way of sharing results of research [@barendregt_intermediate-level_2018].

An interpretation of the abstract / concrete spectrum here in research on design patterns in computing education is on the practicality of application.

In this research, I conceptualised such less practical abstraction as that represented by Wing's interpretation of computational thinking.


### Exploration of findings in relation to CHAT conceptions of abstraction


The previous section began to explored, through the lens of personal appropriation, to variety of skills suitable for development via this learning design. The final section surfaced a  distinction between curricular contents commonly associated with a more abstract understandings of personal knowledge, including more abstract elements of computation thinking. This section continues an interpretation of this chapters findings and an socio-cultural understanding of learning using activity theory as a framework. This investigation has required a careful investigation of abstract-concrete dimensions of emerging knowledge happening in the game making and digital making more generally. To start, let us consider the nature of the abstraction of gameplay design patterns via Sannino' [-@sannino_activity_2011] distinction between empirical and theoretical abstraction.

    "While observation and categorization are actions at the root of empirical abstraction, practical transformation, change, and experimentation are actions at the root of theoretical abstraction. Theoretical abstraction allows one to generate and project complex, theoretically mastered concrete manifestations and developmental forms of the reality under scrutiny. A theoretical abstraction is based on a functional relationship, also called a germ cell." [@sannino_activity_2011].

<!-- There are two types of abstractions: empirical and theoretical. Empirical abstraction
is a classification of superficial features of phenomena. Theoretical abstraction refers to the identification of the genetic origins of phenomena that may externally be not alike at all. A theoretical abstraction is based on a functional relationship, also called a germ cell.  While observation and categorization are actions at the root of empirical abstraction, practical transformation, change, and experimentation are actions at the root of theoretical abstraction. Theoretical abstraction allows one to generate and project complex, theoretically mastered concrete manifestations and developmental forms of the reality under scrutiny
Title: Activity theory as an activist and interventionist theory, Author: Sannino, Date: 10/2011 -->
<!-- A deeper exploration of other concepts may suit another chapter looking at synthesing observations in relation to broader research.  -->

In this research, the empirical level of abstraction is  present in P1 and in P2 where features to be added to the game were classified gameplay features and categorised according to to the existing MDA framework. Moving beyond the empirical towards the theoretical aspect, is the early positioning of each feature as a gameplay design pattern which can be described and supplemented with a suggested code structures and examples.
ANY OTHERS

The key, guiding conception here becomes the pedagogical utility of a strong coupled link between a feature of an observable game product (in this case gameplay design patterns) and scaffolding resources available within a community. This concept becomes the root of the varied approaches and forms of support outlined in this chapter. Some instances based on this kernel concept were created by myself in response to user requests in varied forms of support documentation outlined in Chapter 5 ( e.g. quick start card### Design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework (compared to computational thinking)


The process of identifying and working with GDPs in this research process can be mapped as a dialectical process of moving (rising) to the concrete [@sannino_activity_2011]. It is this movement from a kernel idea into varied concrete instances that is the root of the power of the approach according to CHAT scholars.  While, the varied uses as meditational strategies and their integration into varied concrete forms of creative cultural and interpersonal repertoires many be particular to this setting, the germ cell concept described above is a theoretical and generalisable abstraction not particular to this context.

While the educational use of design patterns and has been explored in other settings via research, the focus has been on professional rather than novice learners.  

While I address areas for future research in the conclusion, a proposed benefit of this research is While understanding the process is more obviously useful for facilitators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects.to underscore the potential and to uncover a starting point for pedagogies that can be transferred to diverse design projects.

<!-- While understanding the process is more obviously useful for faciliators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects. -->




<!-- Through this lens the most abstract activity system is the larger one who's objective, to make an engaging game that tells an environmental story, aligns with the problem level of LOA. The level between abstract and concrete is that of choosing, implementing and testing game design patterns, which aligns with design. The most concrete in this interpretation is then the implementation of different lines of code or creation and migration of digital assets. -->

### Exploration of GDPs as mid-level construct in relation to other conceptions of abstraction in computing education research

Waite's interpretation of levels of abstraction and semantic waves in a computing education context is potentially relevant as example of how can contribute to the debate in this area. In terms of semantic waves, the movement between abstract and concrete is helpful to address some of the issues concerning inclusion and accessibility of overly abstract approaches [@papert_epistemological_1990]. However, if we return to Papert and Turkle's [-@papert_epistemological_1990] challenge to the legitimacy of the primacy of abstract, top-down approaches to teaching coding, such an approach would also challenge Waite rationale of alternating between abstract and concrete poles.

While, none of the author's above are clear about what exactly is meant by the abstract in their explorations, a synthesis of relevant literature supports an spectrum of abstraction, from Wing's take on CT at the most abstract, and specifics coding constructs or even syntax at the most concreted. Such a spectrum is in is broadly in line with LOA interpretation, although the purpose is shown as the higher level of abstraction. ANY DIFFERENCES?


MOVE - chapter 2? COMPRESS?
In Papert's research, detailed study of young coders evolving code creations and accompanying interview data allowed a close study of the personal appropriation, including elements of understanding, application and sharing back this knowledge via created and shared digital projects. Much subsequent research on the use of coding to develop both concrete and more abstract computational thinking skills, has neglected this social and perspectives [find source], instead focusing on a personal dimension of learning as a curricular skill to be absorbed and tested. By way of contrast, this study is aligned with the development of the constructionist movement towards socio-cultural approaches to transcend individual personal conceptions of knowledge, exemplified by the issues associated with the UK computing curriculum.


PERHAPS BRING UP UP TO DATE ISSUE OF TRANSFER. - BUT PERHAPS LEAVE FOR CONCLUSION. NOTE ALSO THE BALANCE BETWEEN CT CONCRETE SKILLS AND TRANSFER IN [@kynigos_modifying_2020]



<!-- **In terms of recommendations for researchers / practitioners of an intermediate framework:** -->


<!-- As such this research has only more theoretical propositions rather than participant data. -->

### Comparing my pedagogical framing with existing research

It is productive to ask: how can the use of GDPs as a framework be compared to that of computational thinking given CT's is a dominance in this area?

Turning to alignment with PBL research in digital making, as explored in the literature review a key challenge to project based learning is finding appropriate conceptual and practical frameworks to scaffold domain specific working practices to ameliorate the dialectical tension between engagement via tinkering and requirements to promote "principled understanding" [@barron_doing_1998, p.63]. Waite and colleagues propose that abstraction should be explicitly taught even to younger pupils [@waite_abstraction_2016]. Waite and colleagues [@waite_abstraction_2018-1] also propose the utility of awareness of LOA in terms of learners knowing at what level of abstraction they are operating, although the evidence is not representative and authors call for further research. As a challenge these findings, my own notes and reflections in appendix.learning map cautioned me against explicit teaching of abstraction and imposing shifts in perspectives for fear of interrupting the flow of participant making.


Despite this, in terms of participant experiences, it is clear from this chapters findings that learners _are_ shifting between LOA without explicit in the process of the use of and contribution to this learning design. Participant perspectives shift between the wider goal of making an engaging game for a real and imagined audience to a narrower goal of implementing a game design pattern and the technical actions and operations needed to complete it. This chapter has outlined the potential of GDP concepts, especially used within playtesting, to support these participant shifts in perspective. In this context I judged the imposition of an additional goal of understanding abstract curricular concepts as potentially counter productive to the overall aim of acculturation to game making tools and processes and developing an inclusive idioculture. I had a reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge. My concern also reflected potential disorientation and reduced experiences of agency from imposed shifts of focus rather than self-initiated ones. I also propose that to further research to would be needed to justify the utility take the time to interrupt flow to explicitly teach abstraction, and abstract CT concepts, apart from if understanding of such concepts are required by curriculum constraints.

On the other hand, my reflections support a proposition that there is utility for facilitators to be aware of the level of abstraction both that present in different elements of project learning design and that of the concepts that learners are working with. Different purposes and contexts of learning may require different interpretations, for example greater awareness of abstract concepts for reasons of assessment. According to [@barendregt_intermediate-level_2018], in their identification of design patterns as intermediate level construct, identifying a suitable the level of abstraction is recommended to best support the goals of learners FIND REASON.  Waite and colleagues [@waite_abstraction_2018-1], also identify the intermediate design level of the LOA model as that suitable for supporting grounded abstraction in learner coding. In computing eduction pattern based instruction has benefits of making complex problems more modular and concrete [@muller_almost_2004-1; @waite_teaching_2021]. The evidence and examples surfaced in this paragraph support a view of GDPs, as an productive intermediate-level framework and contributes a series of grounded pedagogical instances via examples. It also proposes GDPs as potentially more productive and accessible framework in terms of pedagogical uses than that of computational thinking when making games.









## Part Two - Agency

### 2.a Affordances, Mediation, TADS,

1. recap on germ cell as common focus point for mediation (some designed or apporpirated)
2. When novel forms of mediation present, gdps sometimes used - thus as double stimulation
3. This is a transformation / expansion in 3GAT terms, recap as a resolution of tensions, and a manifestation of agency
4. Give a summary of examples of tranformational agency
5. The kedging metaphor and the climbing wall metaphor - in relation to agency and design -  explore them, kedging is a bit flailing , wall less so
6. Briefly touch on the job of the learning designer here.



Chapter 5  exposed the tensions that developed in the activity systems and subsequent evolution the tools used include code authoring environment, supporting resources of printed and digital format.

This section  analyse these tensions in more depth,





<!-- ### Justifying the use of Metaphors in these FINDINGS - CONCLUSION?

A mixed readership for this research is hoped for as relevant to pracitioners and some of the break down of agency is quite academic in tone and potentialy opaque.

There is a good tradition of metaphors in this space with Papert's low thresholds, high ceilings and wide walls concept. INSERT IN LR, PERHAPS IN TRANSITION FROM MICROWORLDS TO SCRATCH AND DESIGN BUILD TEST GAME MAKING.  

Metaphors are another vehicle to explore concepts, and different means of representation are a valid from of inclusive communication [UDL link]   -->

Metaphors are another vehicle to explore concepts, and different means of representation are a valid from of inclusive communication. To explore this thought,  I will engage in some metaphorical analysis, some following many other researchers, and introducing some of my own.


The metaphors below help an exploration of the development of cultural and social practice in this community.





### The use of concepts of mediation and dual stimulation in this exploration of the development of agency -

As previously explored, varied conceptions of agency exist including: instrumental, authorial and transformative agency [@matusov_mapping_2016]. (See methodology chapter).

<!-- This section explores these conceptions using the core AT concepts of mediation and dual stimulation explored in Chapter 3 to illuminate pedagogical development related to the interaction of designed and emergent tools and processes, shedding light on dimensions of participant agency. -->

To summarise similarities and distinctions between mediation and double stimulation  [@isaac_cultural_2022], it is beyond an instrumental approach to provoke change in the enviroment.

<!-- Hopwood [@hopwood_agency_2022] explores varied interpretations between mediation and double stimulation, exposing varied interpretations of mediation and ds's special interpretation by Sannino, and the difficulties of then comparing the models of agency.     -->


<!-- DROP?
While the affordances built into the code playground are valid secondary stimuli in initial in helping to seed initial activity,
supporting documentation can be seen as a form of secondary stimulation more aligned to the process of building agency. -->




<!-- RETURNING TO THE TENSIONS OF AUTHENCITY IN CH.5 AND TABLE AND IMPACT ON AGENCY. -->
<!-- Other tensions were resolved with more fundamental shifts to the overall structure of the activity which can be said to align more closely with the concept of transformative (authorial agency) agency.
In many cases design decisions were driven by the response and interest of the participants.

Research on  engendering authorial and transformative agency [@engestrom2006development; @haapasaari_emergence_2016; @sannino_formative_2016]. -->


<!-- REMOVE THIS DUPLICATE EXAMPLE .
For example in my design:
Introducing additional tools in the form of documentation to the initial coding environment and template provided in early stages introduced tensions between the opportunities for independent development and the additional complexity of the process. -->



### Recap of TADS in context?

MOVE - NOT ALIGHED TO THIS SECTION - Integrate research on engendering authorial and transformative agency [@engestrom2006development; @haapasaari_emergence_2016; @sannino_formative_2016].


### Role of the facilitator

The role of the faciliator in this metaphor is to structure the climber journey to the top.

This my be done by
- defining or reducing the use use of specialised terminology  or
- hiding away un-needed complexity.
- signposting issues   
- imagining the lines of sight of the learner. try to remove large obstacles to potential anchour points.


### 2b - Emergent activities in emergent cultural context - TAS, 3rd Spaces, Col, Fok, idiocultures etc.

1. Intro and value of different Metaphors - types of spaces, walled garden, habour, playground / sandbox - used for different reaons but all about ecological aspects
2. Harbour and authenticity in tool use
3. Gutierrez - 3rd space and Fok + examples in this research, this view of agency has a greater focus on participant identity
4. Examples in relation to the role of playtesting / playground to dvelop identity in a safe space, reduced stress, but with an important aspect of social interaction and norming


In research which addresses transformative agency, GutiÃ©rrez et al. [@gutierrez_youth_2019-1] incorporate broader cultural factors including issues of participant identity and movement of practices between learning settings, in ways which are not generally explored in Change Labs approaches.  


**beyond primary and secondary tools / stimulation conception**

For this study, one issue of Sannino and Engestroms general approach is that there are many possible stimuli in a modern environment (find source ), and while yes, participant may adapt them for their own use, the focus on just one is potentially limiting. JUST A THOUGHT.


### Discussion on the role of playtesting in particular as a suitable medium (third space)

<!-- HOW MUCH OF THIS COULD LIVE IN CHAPTER 7 AS A AGENCY / PLAYTESTING SECTION? -->
<!--
HOW TO KEEP THE MOST VALUABLE PART OF THIS SECTION - IMPLICATIONS FOR AGENCY AND FOR IDENTITY - AND INCLUSION / PARTICIPATION
**On playtesting behaviours and interaction with GDP findings** -->

As explored in the literature review, playtesting is a process common to game making which corresponds to the evaluation phase of design thinking cycles and the process of user testing in HCI [@fullerton_game_2018]. In this section, I review data to describe some of the emerging playtesting behaviours of participants in relation to the introduced learning design.

I propose that the evolving idioculture, playtesting in particular, has been crucial to the development of this design. The learning design sprang from emergent activities. As such, the nature and process of this community evolution merits exploration.

The live chat process started unintentionally as one child was left to their own devices as a parent was undertaking a social mission (see below and previous chapter). -->

### Metaphors of space

It is of value to contrast TADS and the kedging metaphor with that of GutiÃ©rrez in the assembling of new repertoires using the findings of the previous chapter.  

In this case metaphors concerning learning spaces and movement between spaces are often found in existing research.  



#### Playtesting, player types and side missions

One GDPs are identifies as a useful tactic of navigation and as a bridging strategy to wider repertoires, then this can inform process of supporting the develoment participants to assemble their own repertoires of practice in this new sestting.

In this design, as outlined in Chapter 5 and Appendix.drama I used a drama narrative, with side missions and the concept of player types to do this. This matches research of 5D and in particular that of GutiÃ©rrez in conceptions of processes of inclusion.


<!-- By the time phase three and video capture of data was underway, the process of playtesting began to take on interesting characteristics for some younger participants who were working more independently. -->
<!-- Because these interactions were mobile between works is it hard to transcribe interactions. However, description of the physical movement and gestures of the young people is relevant to explore the value of this behaviour which I will call playful playtesting.  -->

 <!-- Examples include.... -->

**Playful playtesting**

I observed an evolution of the form and function of playtesting by young participants as an expression of agency by participants. The link to maker types here exists especially in social makers, glitchers and magpies.

Some children added additional playful elements to playtesting.
Some in particular brought a physicality to the process.

See Appendix.playtestingtypes

The process of play testing as a cultural process is explored in more depth now.

<!-- NOTE - Nadine's play on secret missions mirrors some of her more spontaneous play in the previous phase - thus one informs other -->

### Harbours, playgrounds and walled gardens as a way to explore conceptions of (relational) agency -

The motivations for creating starter templates are similar for both educators and professional template creators. The goal being to want to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency.  This strong alignment with authentic, professional practice may help learners transition to other forms of web coding projects, due to the similarity of as this element of practice.
CH.5

My design decision to build the toolset as structure on top of authentic tools and languages can be likened to creating a protective harbour to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency.

Participants are able to leave the protective harbour by accessing more authentic documentation and moving beyond existing templates. The experience may be involve choppier waters but the tools and processes remain familiar.

Many design decisions were made to create a supported, simplified coding environment. Relevant examples from the previous chapter include: using an online code playground; skirting use of specialist terminology; hiding away un-needed complexity in the code template.

While it is important to acknowledge the danger that such support may make learners run into trouble if coding other projects outside of this supported space, the use of authentic code language makes this less of an issues than with specialised coding environments aimed at novices [@hagge_coding_2018]. Thus to make one addition to the metaphor this design is like a sea-harbour, tools like Scratch are like a swimming pool.

This curated replication of authentic process of finding and incorporating code snippets into the starting template supported the development of skills used in professional coding communities.




#### The freedoms and restrictions of playgrounds

Other affordances of the design would encourage greater authorial (and relational agency), for example those designed to build user's sense of belonging in the game making community.

In this research, similar metaphors have emerged in the pedagogical and technical process surrounding the concept of playgrounds and gardens. In the previous section the use of a curated set of design patterns can be referred to as a walled garden or sandbox. The process of checking the performance of games is called playtesing. The web-based environment which reduce the complexity of web development and provide community and immediate feedback are named code playgrounds. While some of this language is specific to the creation of games, other terms are also prevalent in non-game coding.

These metaphors invite a connection to play theories concept of as the magic circle. Play theorist outline the value of stepping into a more controlled area of voluntary experimentation where the fear of failure is reduced. Game rules are norms which seed participation in community processes. The playful context of the game's magic circle can facilitate participants to adapt norms and rules to their own playing styles. Through this lens, the interaction of playtesting, code playgrounds and a sandbox of game patterns emerge as a key practices to facilitate and maintain learner agency. The discussion of the next chapter explores the intersection of these elements in more detail.

MOVE to RECOMMENDATIONS?
The concepts of affective space and magic circle  as a way to encourage participants to improvise from a starting structure are of value to provide guidance to practitioners in the domain of informal digital design.



**Turning to gardening metaphors**

We can compare the metaphor of playgrounds and harbours with that of a walled garden.

It could be extended to _Rewilding_ metaphor to reflect the importance of leaving learners to evolve their own processes as a form of authorial and transformational agency, albeit within the forms of pedagogical walled gardens.


##### Relational Agency in response to a series of stimuli participant identity

Learner agency in the form of choice over the  chosen activity is present not only in the dimensions of the difficulty and theme of the game features they wished to add, but also in their approach to undertaking it.

<!-- ORIGINAL NOTE : KEEP THE FOCUS ON TOOLS HERE - SIGNPOST TO OTHER SECTIONS IF NEEDED. -->

MOVE SOMEWHERE? DIVISION OF LABOUR? MORE FINDINGS?
Some approached objectives in a methodical manner, others socially and others embracing a playfully disruptive stance. Some decided to focus extensively on the creation and implementation of graphical assets and level design.

While the distributed nature of the toolset, hindered peer learning in P1 as too many tools were introduced, in P2 it helped build authentic digital literacy skills. Some young participants became remarkably swift and adapt at thus transforming chains of actions into a fluid operation.

Learners who had mastered the skills were asked by others for help, becoming domain experts, and thus providing additional affordances in the learning community and building an identify as specialist within it.

It is of value to examine specialisation can be seen through the lens of double stimulation. The choice to specialise, marks a form of transformative agency. Participants craft for themselves a specialist status which becomes shared and celebrated by the group.

### The interaction of flexible deign practices, the collection of Game Design Patterns, stepwise scaffolding of learning environments and new understandings of agency.



<!-- BRING IN A SUMMARY OF LEARNING FROM THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER ON GDPS. -->

In the previous chapter we explored the use of GDPs as a possible response to the challenges to project work and the lack of domain specific frameworks. The nature of the framework provided by game play design patterns has been be explored through the lens of agency

This section synthesises the learning design with such interpretations.

And then progresses to recap the potential of this synthesis of these process, framed in other writing as a 3M approach.

Finally it links the the outputs with the research process in terms of the impact of DBR and formative intervention approaches.

#### Synthesis of Characteritics and Analysis

- use-modify-create (UMC) approach. [source] / stepwise

- GDPs as a germ cell, used in different step wise projects which build one upon the other as a flexible but supporting scaffold. balance between structure and choice  -  facilitates a rhizomatic approach / within a structure

- The role of authenticity and the impact on agency


These varied forms of documentation, and their varied adoption and propagation represent different approaches to  scaffolding the process of becoming familiar with and then modifying to the code in often increasingly ambitious ways inline with the stages and ethos of a



- UDL / PBL

Key characteristics of structuring support around quick start activities and a subsequent menu of GDPs which align with existing research include:

The use of a menu / collection of resources can be considered an inclusive educational practice and offer a rich description of a concrete example which aims to align to inclusive, practice-based frameworks like UDL and PBL. While this may involve more work in advance, the benefits to inclusive practice merit it.

<!-- This decreased need for secondary documentation minimises the possibility for task / tool mismatch.  As outlined above, to avoid the barriers experienced when searching authentic, developer-focused documentation and the support forums, I created  bespoke code examples in an online collection. -->







## Part 3.b: Synthesis in relation to Agency and Sketchy pedagogies    

1. Shifting forms of agency
2. Danger of the design being too complete, a concept of sketchy pedagogy

HARBOURS.

### Shifting forms of Agency

From TA in P1
To relational in P2
Increased support for relational in P3

**Proposal on shifting forms of agency.**
How different forms of  agency are developed and transform over iterations of this game making programme  

Initial blocks are solved by heroic transformative agency of parents, children and facilitator.

Then patterns and tools become established in the community, and agency shifts to be less authorial and more instrumental and relational.

A question arises, is it less valueable in later iterations? Different stokes probably.


### Danger of designing away the possibility for transformational agency

**AN EMERGING QUESTION  - Is nurturing agency by creating space for emergent practices sustainable for ongoing iterations? How much of the learning design can/should be transferred to other settings.**

Is it a negative thinkg that later participants have less opportunity for transformative agency?

Also - A personal refection while I love this aspect, but others can find it stressful. Different strokes.

<!--
NEEDED: MORE SYNTHESIS / DISCUSSION ON Instrumental agency, TRANFORMATIONAL AGENCY AND AUTHORIAL AGENCY IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS WORK ON METHODOLOGY. -->

INTEGRATE SOME OF THIS INTO THE SECTIONS OR THE DISCUSSION ABOVE ON

As a learning designer, design decisions to create a sheltered harbour, increase the instrumental agency of learners allowing them to experience a feeling of control over their creative process.

Adopting analysis which aligns authorial agency and transformative agency, there is a potential tension between instrumental agency and transformative agency. A design which minimises possible conflicts also reduces the potential for participants to solve them both individually and collective responses.

To retain this potential for transformation
it may be advantageous to keep some key areas of the learning design should be more open in structure to encourage the emergence of participant responses and novel practices.

And the danger of being too instrumental if the design is too complete.

A danger that my interest and focus on messy / sketchy pedagogies would try to avoid. But which has wider implications in terms of inclusion and levels of stress for participants.








## Conclusion

In AT terminology, this chapter has in a general sense returned to the concrete (see Marx / Blunden).

Chapter four outlined a design narrative where tools were chosen and adapted by myself and Participants in response to local context. Chapter five explored the emerging organisational unit of GDPs, and how they were used as meditational strategies.  

This chapter has explored emergent cultural and community activity, and deepened discussion on interpersonal activity, and then returned to discuss implications for dimensions of concrete tool use on learner agency.

It's dialectic innit. We call it praxis.

The methodology chapter outlined some of the challenges of this approach, particularly in the thick description of context, and the challenge of then satisfying the goal of generalisability / and overall utitlity.

The final chapters aims to address this with  recommendations for facilitators and researchers. The scope of the applicability is addressed as the findings of this thesis can inform the wider debate of how to best support project based learning in wider domains. Specifically the use of concrete design frameworks and step-based iterative project in scaffolding PBL.

## TO MOVE OR DROP FROM CHAPTER



### On planned and emergent activity)

MOVE TO A DISCUSSION SECTION?
COMPRESS FOR INTRO?
THIS IS PART OF DBR - REFERENCE THAT IF IT IS STILL NEEDED FOR THE CHAPTER.



The previous chapters have described interventions in design that can be characterised on a spectrum between those planned and introduced by myself as a facilitator and those which were emergent, i.e. invented or adopted by participants as a response to the contradictions covered in chapter four.  

The distinction between planned and emergent activities became blurred as practices merged. In Chapter 6 outlines that while  I tool a lead to collate game design patterns into an organised collection with accompanying resources and a navigational menu, many of these patterns, were introduced  initially by participants who recognised them and wanted to add them to their own games.

This aligns with a key characteristic of formative intervention and DBR. Namely that elements of the introduced design changed responsive to learner need as the design evolved through iterations. Some introduced  processes outlined in this chapter were very minimal in embryonic form but extended significantly by participants.


AT theory emphasises that the process of activity does not start in a vacuum. This helps justify the formative intervention process which is active in intervention and in the initial shaping of activity. In an educational context, this can involve introduction of tasks as starting activities to shape. This is justified conceptually from a view of not restricting participant agency in that some form of activity should be suggested in order for them to make a rational choice as to weather to participate. It follows that this activity should encourage the communication that participant choice is significant in the design.

<!-- NOTE - NOTES ON THE CULTURE OF HARDNESSS - FIT IN SOMEWHERE IF APPROPRIATE

When explored from game making perspective the hard is good lens, is limiting in terms of building the engagement of players. However, culturally the desire to make games hard for other participants is more understandable in the context of retro games. .

- arcade games were designed to be hard to extract money from players
- nes games reputation for being brutal as they often had no way to save states, and much of the games challenge, due to limitations of number of levels or modes of playing, depended on this 'hardness'
- this developed later for snes games , finding challenge and other forms of ways of maintaining interest for different genres of games_
- retro games are associated therefore with being brutal and frustrating.
- thus in some ways the process of making a hard game is a way of getting your own back at all the games that have frustrated

### Building Identities as Game Makers  - EXTENDED

PARK THIS FOR NOW IN DESIGN CHAPER

COULD RETURN TO THIS IN A DISCUSSION CHAPTER - AS HAS IMPACT ON GDP TOO.

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with the positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you. -->

#### Helpers supporting supportive community behaviours

While not a key part of this study, it is of value to briefly examine the role of student helpers in this phase.
One of their remits was to support the work of participants and to guide reflection by asking simple questions like "What have you been working on?", What are you working on now. What do you want to add to your game. Beyond this, students also gave feedback between playtestings sessions, connected different participants, supported parental behaviours,   into the design process via debriefing sessions. In journal notes I made observations and gathered feedback, while not fo extensively studied there is potential here.
Especialy in the potential to replicate family supportive behaviours with non-expert facilitators in a volunteering settings, specifically with bespoke guidance to support game making.

<!-- #### Discussion on design stages and GDP for this pair - DROP THIS?

 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.
 This parent was much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents. The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker/player type (concepts explored in previous chapter). This interpretation seems confirmed by less social interactions compared to may parents. The pair engaged far less in play testing of other games and peer support to overcome barriers. They also followed the stages of design more closely than may other groupings, an observation which is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

 This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." This alternation is driven or facilitated by the different stages of implementing GDPs. The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

 Using the coded data from nvivo to compare design cycle stages with pair collaboration, it can be observed that the most likely stages for pair collaboration were during the Ask/Imagine stage, Testing and Planning.

 The vignette shows evidence of that the actions of the parent to re-engage the child at different stages of the design cycle helped sustain the child's engagement in the more focused design process happening on the screen. However, an opposing pattern of behaviour may also be valid. When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups. Within Rogoff's model of community of learners [-@rogoff_developing_1994], this observation is viewed as valid form of participation. The child's ability to legitimately disengage from pair coding to observe the work and interactions of others in this emerging community of learners may also be sustaining.

 It is of note that when describing the design cycle for this family that this family along with others are working with decomposed smaller design challenges in the form of implementing GDPs. Thus the cycle is repeated for each new pattern that the pair take on. These smaller design iterations can be expressed within the framework of AT as an activity system. -->

 <!-- #### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

 NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION?
  NOTE - This more general observation may be part of the previous chapter

 We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

 - The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
 - This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

 Discussion

 - The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

 The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity. -->

<!-- #### Designing to incorporate learner identity

Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].

This chapter supports this research and also finds game making as  a suitable medium to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

Conceptually, within AT, these interventions and design choices which yield possibilities for self-exploration can be see as potential anchor points to increase learner agency.

In summary:

Family game making, of completing projects together with your parents or siblings has potential to remove the **I'm not that sort of person** barrier of cultural identity as participants are surrounded by their people.

  - the choice of retro games as a medium provokes sharing for older participants while their enduring popularity maintains common ground with younger participants;

This distinction is fluid as some tools and processes which emerged in community practice, prove to be successful and which are then adopted as a suggested process for the next iteration of the design.

The full process and rationale and initial reactions are detailed in appendix 4.x . In summary,

The process was very engaging, parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital identities of their children. As part of the process I then proposed that there different game maker types and asked participants to evaluate and discuss with peers what kind of game maker they were. From the following list.

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

**A tension in use of norming practices and participant choice?**
However, as a seeming counterpoint to this growing agency is the norming effects of concepts that gain community currency in playtesting. The repeated attempts by participants to make the jumping mechanic of Molly less frustrating can be seen as a potential drag on the agency or autonomy of Molly as a designer. However this may be a false dichotomy. Such norming practices can be seen from a different perspective according to Rogoff, as a productive nudge to get real.

#### Community concepts and norming behaviour emerging during playtesting

MOVE BACK TO CHAPTER 6 IF SPACE?

NOTE THERE IS SOMETHING HERE ABOUT ME STEPPING BACK AND LETTING THE COMMUNITY EVOLVE.

Ed gives a more technical explanation from  involving the naming of the variable _jump speed_.

Other children come and play the game but only for less than a minute before leaving. Towards the end of the playtesting process, as one child leaves, Molly comments "It's so frustrating." This suggests an evolving understanding that her game is frustrating to players rather than pleasantly challenging.

The indirect norming behaviours described in appendix 5.Norm.x mirror observations seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues [@rogoff_cultural_2003] on learning in  community settings.

There is an apparent tension in play here between encouraging individual agency of expression within the game and an evolving community tendency to norm peoples games to be more _playable_, specifically that player movement should conforming to wider expectations.

What we can draw from the data at this stage is that playtesing provides many leverage points to facilitating learner agency and discuss the limits of designs. IN addition, playtesting is a process that allows participants to demonstrate informed criticality as a player and guide the creations of peers via gameplay feedback.

This process is an example of an emerging process where cultural concepts are mutually constituted by all actors involved in the game making activity system. While the concepts of hardness and challenge that emerge and not concrete examples of GDPS, they are the results of changed GDPs. The next chapter explores similar data on the use of GDP related concepts by participants and the resultant potential impact on participant agency.


<!-- #### Why prioritise local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community - and how are they different in character? PERHAPS DROP IF NOT NEEDED OR KEEP REALLY SHORT. AND MERGE UP.

While a lot of other research has focused on community as an online phenomenon, in this research that aspect has not been explored.

This section explores my decision to prioritise local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community as well as  how are they different in character.

One reason was practical,  a suitable online community pitched at children or even at novices was not apparent using the chosen tools set.

The advantages of this decision is that interactions play out off the screen, the limited games available increase community interaction, as participants drew only from a small pool of locally created games.

While there is convincing research on on how online community  can engender feelings of agency and motivation [ROQUE AND ITO AND GEE], I chose not to connect with existing online communities in this learning design. Online communities can serve as a form of authentic feedback as explored in the Scratch and New Grounds community websites. However, the process of being involved in an online community and in addition learning the processes of participation diverts time and focus from other activities including real life playtesting.

In addition, the diversity of creations available on a online community may also have detracted from the more shared experience of the template used. Not offering a choice of starting game helped this shared technical and cultural base.      -->



####  MoE

One area of research which was explored in this learning design but which has needed to be deprioritise is that of Mantle of the Expert and the permission to play and experiment which the drama process advocates.

While a fuller exploration of how this was put into practice in P3 via a narrative which wrapped around the making activity, it is relevant to the use of side missions, and the possibility for character exploration in terms of a maker type.

### Affordances as points on a climbing wall to support understandings of instrumental agency - MOVE

<!-- In the original metaphor the casting of the anchor is random, experimental. It is unsure if the anchor will catch on anything under the surface. However,  -->

The exploration of tensions in Chapter 5 summary, design decisions of tool use can to increase agency in practical terms by providing affordances or by removing barriers to use. Conceptually these practical dimension can be framed as instrumental agency or removing aspects of negative liberty caused by technical barriers [@matusov_mapping_2016, p. 433].
But may remove authorial or relational agency.

As an example take the tensions surrounding  authenticity of coding web development language, coding environment and documentation. my choice of curated collection of docs prevented friction and potential confusion if using real developer documents.  


In this design, participants aim for affordances as visible  points.

In the design above such  points include: regular play-testing; the use of documentation; and highlighted variables and level structure in the quick start stage.

To incorporate the utility of  previously used affordances within the community,  we can imagine a climbing rock-face metaphor of a lead climber leaving a trail for others behind. Or in a training environment of a climbing wall, attaching colours to a particular route designed to suit a particular skill level.

<!-- Similarly, as the process unfold the faciliator may see learners repeatedly run into the same obstacle and not be able to see the anchor points available to them. Perhaps even catching onto snags or other debris, false anchor points. -->


The role of the faciliator in this metaphor is to structure the climber journey to the top.

This my be done by
- defining or reducing the use use of specialised terminology  or
- hiding away un-needed complexity.
- signposting issues   
- imagining the lines of sight of the learner. try to remove large obstacles to potential anchour points.

### Exploring transformative agency using the metaphor of Kedging anchors


As outlined in chapter 3, Sannino explains TADS using a  metaphor of a using a kedging anchors.

The following section integrates affordance theory into a metaphor to encompass concerns of a more structured learning design.


#####  LINKING TO ANCHORS TO AFFORDENCES

Thus affordances in the learning design can be viewed in this frame as a catching point for these anchors [@hopwood_agency_2022]. An effective learning environment provides a sea bed with many rocks (affordances) for warping anchors (volitional acts of participant agency to transform learning) [@aagaard_teacher_2022].
TADS and the associated metaphor of warping anchors is normally applied in settings of group action.

To aid learners agency, designers notice existing paths of participants and add explicit anchor points and make them visible to learners. The process is on-going and mutual. Additionally, this work happens in an facilitated environment. Design decisions server to clarify common problems areas, thus making the water clearer to better see anchor points. The job of the designer is in part to identify the causes of turbulence and thus create support in a sheltered space of a harbour.


**An example of mini TADS - use of secondary resources**
 <!-- REFLECTION ON BRICOLAGE? -->
An illustrative design tension emerged surrounding which kind of documentation to prioritise. After initially steering participants directly to code snippets, I subsequently directed them instead to step by step tutorials which also included a link to the code snippets. I shifted between prioritising instruction-based practices and more piecemeal, bricolage inspired (see LR) developer practices. Whilst the process of instruction is problematic in terms of learner agency this vies with the practicality to establish a common understanding and shared framework for production.

a theme explored in more detail in chapter five
Traditional, printed, instruction-based software manuals are in decline partly due online documentation but also due to the increased intuitive nature of their design [@pogue_user_2017].
CH 5.

vThe careful alignment between navigational documentation and the participants driving objectives of the mid-level activity system of implementing a game element, also helped avoid mismatch between task and tools described above as mismatch between primary and secondary stimuli.
The process aligns with the concept of just-in-time instruction.
