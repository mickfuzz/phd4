## Introduction

The previous chapters have explored both designed and fortuitous changes to the learning design that become adopted by the community.

This chapter deepens analysis and discussion on RQ2 on the potential uses of GDPs and concludes with  analysis and discussion on RQ3 addressing reflections on partcipant agency.

Following Chapter 6's presentation findings on how participants use GDPs, this chapter contains further discussion on this use GDPs ,
particularly in reference to the building of agency.

To do this chapter continues to explore the context of the study's emergent cultural and community activity, deepens discussion on interpersonal activity and implications for dimensions of tool use on learner agency in a way which at times addresses wider aspects of the learning design than GDPs.

This chapter has three main sections:

1. Rising to concrete ; Conceptions of abstract and concrete present in computing and digital making research: ultimately, proposing design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework compared to computational thinking.

<!-- - propose that GDPs provide a suitable way to engage with coding practices partly due to their position between abstract computational concepts and concrete implementations of code structures. -->

3. Synthesis in relation to  Issues of inclusive pedagogy. UDL, UMC, MOE.  This  underline the entire motivation and design of the study. Returning therefore to a fundamental point of the study to explore how this help diverse learners in a challenging area to learn. Ending by suggesting UDL as a helpful framework,

- explore potential implications for facilitators and researchers on how to design for inclusion and agency - e.g. use of GDP collection as an  intermediate pedagogical construct.

The lens of inclusion and the alignment with UDL is relevant as a possible resolution to abstract  / concrete tensions as a gateway to access diverse learner pathways and thus avoid an overly complex navigational framework thus reducing cogintive load.

<!-- - MOVE TO CONCLUSION? metaphors / frameworks to envisage affordences and particpant agency in CHAT framework. and why this is useful for facilitators and as an accessibel way to share findings. -->




The chapter contains a discussion on wider concerns of designing for learner agency. Here I synthesise analysis on processes which support learners to develop agency in this game making community
(and the role of different levels of authenticity?)

This section takes a step back to explore the wider perspectives of the findings beyond the immediate context to digital making and project based approaches and understandings of design patterns in educational contexts.

**more intro material**

An underlying proposal of this thesis is the development of  learner agency can be facilitated by designing effective learning environments. To do this I draw on key forms of developmental agency explored in Chapter 3.

This section synthesises findings learner agency in relation to existing conceptions of agency in other research.

This section explores these academic conceptions in a playful way using relatable metaphors from related research. The aim of this playful/relatable approach is to aid the situation of later recommendations for researchers and educators working in this area in an accessible way.

## Part one - Exploring concepts of abstract and concrete knowledge frameworks in relation to Game Design Patterns


1. Recap, GDPs as a Germ cell, Exploring CHAT concepts of abstraction  
2. Locating TADS in this perspective, via 3GAT concept of expansion via double stimulation and TADS
3. Papert - pluralism & the concrete
4. then Waite Levels of abstraction - & observations
5. Then begin practical use of this take - tinkering pedagogy

In chapter two I described the characteristics and limits of computational thinking as a pedagogical framework, specifically concepts include: varied interpretations; the role of levels of abstraction for teachers and learners; and the value of epistemological pluralism as a way to value concrete approaches.

The previous chapter began to explore, through the lens of personal appropriation, to variety of abstract concepts and more concrete applications suitable for development via this learning design. This investigation has provoked careful reflection of abstract-concrete dimensions of emerging knowledge happening in the game making and digital making more generally.

There are two main aspects of this. Firstly, the research process and the evolving design involve a process of rising to the concrete, identifying an abstraction of interest and then different concrete instantiations of it. Secondly, the abstract concrete tension runs as a theme through the literature of this domain. This section addresses both aspects.

This section ends by unifying these threads with an proposal of GDPs as a mid-level construct, demonstrating their utility for both educational designers and researchers.


### Exploration of findings in relation to CHAT conceptions of abstraction

WHY IMPORTANT? LINK BACK HERE?

<!-- surfacing a distinction between curricular contents commonly associated with a more abstract understandings of personal knowledge, including more abstract elements of computation thinking.  -->

To start, let us consider the nature of the abstraction of gameplay design patterns via Sannino' [-@sannino_activity_2011] distinction between empirical and theoretical abstraction.

    "While observation and categorization are actions at the root of empirical abstraction, practical transformation, change, and experimentation are actions at the root of theoretical abstraction. Theoretical abstraction allows one to generate and project complex, theoretically mastered concrete manifestations and developmental forms of the reality under scrutiny. A theoretical abstraction is based on a functional relationship, also called a germ cell." [@sannino_activity_2011].

<!-- There are two types of abstractions: empirical and theoretical. Empirical abstraction
is a classification of superficial features of phenomena. Theoretical abstraction refers to the identification of the genetic origins of phenomena that may externally be not alike at all. A theoretical abstraction is based on a functional relationship, also called a germ cell.  While observation and categorization are actions at the root of empirical abstraction, practical transformation, change, and experimentation are actions at the root of theoretical abstraction. Theoretical abstraction allows one to generate and project complex, theoretically mastered concrete manifestations and developmental forms of the reality under scrutiny
Title: Activity theory as an activist and interventionist theory, Author: Sannino, Date: 10/2011 -->
<!-- A deeper exploration of other concepts may suit another chapter looking at synthesing observations in relation to broader research.  -->

In this research, the empirical level of abstraction is  present in P1 and in P2 where features to be added to the game were classified gameplay features and categorised according to to the existing MDA framework. Moving beyond the empirical towards the theoretical aspect, is the early positioning of each feature as a gameplay design pattern which can be described and supplemented with a suggested code structures and examples.
ANY OTHERS

The key, guiding conception here becomes the pedagogical utility of a strong coupled link between a feature of an observable game product (in this case gameplay design patterns) and scaffolding resources available within a community. This concept becomes the root of the varied approaches and forms of support outlined in this chapter. Some instances based on this kernel concept were created by myself in response to user requests in varied forms of support documentation outlined in Chapter 5 ( e.g. quick start card

 <!-- Design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework (compared to computational thinking) -->


The process of identifying and working with GDPs in this research process can be mapped as a dialectical process of moving (rising) to the concrete [@sannino_activity_2011]. It is this movement from a kernel idea into varied concrete instances that is the root of the power of the approach according to CHAT scholars.  While, the varied uses as meditational strategies and their integration into varied concrete forms of creative cultural and interpersonal repertoires many be particular to this setting, the germ cell concept described above is a theoretical and generalisable abstraction not particular to this context.


Rather than Germ Cell for learning designers the concept of strong concepts or intermediate concepts may be more relatable and applicable [@hook_strong_2012; @barendregt_intermediate-level_2018]

And invites this discussion to turn to the role of conceptions of abstract and concrete in the process of designing for learning, with a particular focus on the concern of this study of participant agency.

While the educational use of design patterns and has been explored in other settings via research, the focus has been on professional rather than novice learners.  




<!-- While understanding the process is more obviously useful for faciliators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects. -->




<!-- Through this lens the most abstract activity system is the larger one who's objective, to make an engaging game that tells an environmental story, aligns with the problem level of LOA. The level between abstract and concrete is that of choosing, implementing and testing game design patterns, which aligns with design. The most concrete in this interpretation is then the implementation of different lines of code or creation and migration of digital assets. -->


### Exploration of GDPs as mid-level construct in relation to other conceptions of abstraction in computing education research


#### Design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework - THE HYPOTHESIS

This direction of the findings of the last chapter, support findings on design patterns in other contexts as a middle ground between abstract CT concepts and more concrete techniques.

    In order to be useful, patterns must present an abstraction of good practice at a meaningful level of granularity. Formulations that are too abstract will be impractical in real design use; those that are too specific will be difficult to re-use in new scenarios.[@dearden_pattern_2006, p. 20]

A similar interpretation is adopted by Eriksson and colleagues [-@eriksson_using_2019] using gameplay design patterns with young people which drew inspiration from research on  value of design patterns as a form of "intermediate-level concept" [@barendregt_intermediate-level_2018], a form of "representation of knowledge in-between  general theories and particular artefacts in terms of abstraction and  generalizability" [@eriksson_using_2019, p.15].  

An alignment in this framing from the design research community with CHAT interpretation of the utility of a germ cell construct can be made in terms of the utility of the process and the process of divining a abstract enough germ cell to merit application in other instances.

However, given that the area of research in which this is carried out is CCI rather than that of learning computer programming or game making, it is value to examine types of abstract / concrete framework in this area.


Additionally, it is important to ask who these frameworks are aimed at.

#### Purpose of the frameworks being addressed is also relevant.

Before further analysis on semantic waves, and types of abstract / concrete framework

This is the motivational aspect of framework?

a. As a research framework - Eriksson et al.
b. A facilitator / design framework -
c. as a participant framework for navigation and goal formation as explored in the previous chapter.

Addressing the first aspect, the process of rising the concrete outlined above is helpful not just for analysis (a) but also for ongoing pedagogical design (b).

The third aspect c, can be returned to, but where and when in this chapter? Points follow:
- the link with the experienced feature of the game / product as a framework increases inclusive nature of process (later?)

PERHAPS MOVE THIS TO NEXT SECTION
What about semantic waves and movement. How explicit does the understanding of the motion between poles need to be? For example in my design, it is not very explicit of guided towards. However, this may be different in different UK computing settings.

This potential non-alignment with UK non-formal may be a limitation in the take up of this research.  



#### Types of abstraction in frameworks - recalling definitions or lack of clear definitions
**More concrete CT**
Q: What is abstraction and who useful for?

The term abstraction has varied interpretation even within the field of computer science education [@hazzan_reducing_2002].

It is of a value to return to, what exactly is meant by the abstract within existing pedagogies in this domain explore this area. To do this we can turn to concepts explored in Chapters 1 and 2: computational thinking, Papert and Turkle's concept of epistemological pluralism and bricolage approach and  the concept of levels of abstraction (LOA)  


##### Computational thinking

In this research, I conceptualised such less practical abstraction as that represented by Wing's interpretation of computational thinking. Which as explored in Chapter 2 is a more abstract definition can be see as overarching computing principles with cross over to high level structural design approaches.

<!-- To ground this in GCSE examples.

Iteration and Selection are in the gcse example, tick examples of them. Just recognise. -->

While Wing's emphasis on the importance of the explicit teaching of skills of decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking, contribution on computational thinking is  more theoretical than applied. Begs question how do you teach computation thinking in most abstract way via explicit teaching. Grover [@grover_computational_2017; @grover_computational_2013], Guzdial [@guzdial_learner-centered_2015]- offer explicit techniques linked with computer coding. Bell and colleagues [@bell2019constructing] explore the process of unplugged activities, exploring abstract CT concepts without using computers or coding.

This learning design takes a fundamentally different approach. Abstract aspects of CT are strongly scaffolded, i.e. the process of code decomposition via the pre-existing functions in the code template, and abstraction again in template via the graphical design tool. The process of abstraction is also present, indeed it is present in the the last section addressing the process of moving from concrete exploration to an abstract germ cell of GDP use. The subsequent structuring of the of core learning design around a collection of GDPs coupling description and implementation also involves the processes of decomposition and pattern recognition. Thus, while the process was collaborative in goal formation the heavy lifting was carried out by myself, a decision justified by focusing on more relational elements of the learning design aligned with the RQ3. In this context, Wing's CT framework describes some of the processes I have undertaken as a learning designer and researcher, but is less relevant to participants.


**More concrete CT**: As explored in the appendix on learning map, the more concrete elements of CT definition [@brennan_new_2012], which exist on a more applied level, are readily observed in the data as explored in the following section.


<!-- What has this research got to say about the relationship between the two? -->
<!-- **In terms of recommendations for researchers / practitioners of an intermediate framework:** -->
<!-- As such this research has only more theoretical propositions rather than participant data. -->

##### Levels of Abstraction

While Waite and colleagues also propose that abstraction should be explicitly taught, even to younger pupils [@waite_abstraction_2016], their approach to abstraction [@waite_abstraction_2018-1] is distinct from that just tackled in that it is grounded in an operationalised  computational model distinguishing levels of abstract to concrete, specifically, in descending order of abstraction,
the goal or problem to be solved, the designed structure of the program, the actual coding of that design and at the most concrete level the running of the code and its outputs [@waite_abstraction_2018-1]. Wing's CT concepts within the LOA model would lie in the design level.


Their advocacy for the utility of awareness of levels of abstraction, based on research indicating its efficacy to support learning programming [@cutts2012abstraction; @statter_teaching_2016], states the value of learners knowing at what level of abstraction they are operating and a fluency of movement between the levels. Waite and Sentence's later work synthesised this approach with interpretation of levels of abstraction and semantic waves in a computing education aligned with a UK curricular context  [@sentance_primm_2017]. The focus of semantic waves aimed at teachers to help them design learning experiences which allow for participant shifts in LOA perspectives.
<!-- This context frames the following contribution to the debate in this area. -->


Following Waite et al. interpretation, in the Use stage of the UMC model [@lee_computational_2011] (explored in Chapter 5 in relation to this research's learning design), participants would be aware of the goal of the program, and the results. Subsequently, in the Modify stage they would become familiar with the design and code levels. Further analysis of my learning design in relation to the concept of LOA follows, after an exploration of abstract and concrete learning approaches in the work of Papert and colleagues in the following section.


<!-- THIS DEPENDS ON WHAT THE CONCEPTION OF ABSTRACTION IS HERE -->

##### Epistemological pluralism, bricolage & Microworlds

In Chapter 2 the concepts and legacy of Papert and Turkle's [-@papert_epistemological_1990] exploration of diversity in coding approaches which the call epistemological pluralism. The focus here is on their championing of approaches beyond the dominant formal/ abstract approach that "emphasizes control and through structure and planning" [@papert_epistemological_1990, p.134]. This approach which can be characterised by the following: a top-down design processing involving extensively planning prior to coding, explicit teaching of language principles and syntax, coding from scratch rather than altering existing products. To counter this dominance, Papert and Turkle [-@papert_epistemological_1990] highlighted the value of a more concrete computing pedagogy, likening the process to bricolage, a craft based approach where participants become very familiar with their tools and materials. The authors exploration of the types of coders as either Planners or Bricoleurs aligns with two aspects of the making styles explored briefly in Chapter 5. Bricoleur types are describes as preferring to stay in closer contact with the a concrete sense of the outcomes even to the expense of programming efficiency of neatness of code.

This recognition and advocacy for the bricolage approach, seemingly also also challenge Waite's research on the importance of alternating between abstract and concrete dimensions present in research on semantic waves, and the value of participants being aware of the level of abstraction at which they are working.

THIS NEEDS WORK - MORE ON MY EXAMPLES? 

A careful examination of the literature is needed here to catch the complexities present. The celebration here is of pluralism rather than the culturally prevalent one privileging abstraction. Abstraction is not seen as undesirable.

Papert's focus on Microworlds using the LOGO language as a vehicle to make concrete previously abstract mathematical concepts, seems to locate the exploration of abstract knowledge as a learning goal.

This, can be perhaps profitably explored using the concept of leading activity, which in this case is play rather than instruction, and is led by the child rather than the teacher.



<!-- Their celebration of concrete coding approaches, including the use of tangible physical and digital objects, and more piecemeal, bricolage approach has influenced the design of popular educational programming software and pedagogy through the constructionist school and maker movements (as explored in the literature review). -->

<!--

move to lit review?
However, Wilensky [-@wilensky1991abstract] questions the nature of abstract in this context arguing that all objects and concepts are abstract until familiarity makes them more concrete to the user. -->


<!-- #### In SUMMARY

Thus in summary conceptions of abstraction above explored above include:

- Wing's take on computational thinking: abstraction, decomposition, generalisation / pattern recognition, implementation via an algorithmic process.
- A more holistic practice-based definition from Resnick, Brennan -
- Waite's LOA - abstract here drawing on levels within the problem or product  - navigation between levels, explicit teaching of such navigation. -->

### Observations on abstract / concrete dimensions in my data related to gameplay design patterns.

**Turning to my design / analyis**

I now returning to the proposal of GDPs as a useful intermediate level framework,  given the framing of abstract in summary above, and explore this proposal using the findings of my research process.  


**In terms of CT,  and semantic waves**

LATER?
As a challenge Waite's findings on levels of abstraction, my own notes and reflections in appendix.learning map cautioned me against explicit teaching of abstraction and imposing shifts in perspectives for fear of interrupting the flow of participant making.

However, while it is problematised in relation to agency development later, While this research doesn't negate the value of explicit teaching of computational thinking,

Thus, I would propose that a design pattern approach, with structured reflection is an excellent way to do that. This was an area of development in P4, with a diagram expressed which drew on the concept of semantic waves.

LINK TO DIAGRAM

Then, Turning to the value of a learning map of learning dimensions, If CT is needed, then P4 developed resources suitable for such reflection. Linking from docs to descriptions. This does need development, an area of promise though.

LINK TO LEARNING Map
Turning to alignment with PBL research in digital making, as explored in the literature review a key challenge to project based learning is finding appropriate conceptual and practical frameworks to scaffold domain specific working practices to ameliorate the dialectical tension between engagement via tinkering and requirements to promote "principled understanding" [@barron_doing_1998, p.63].

PERHAPS BRING UP UP TO DATE ISSUE OF TRANSFER. - BUT PERHAPS LEAVE FOR CONCLUSION. NOTE ALSO THE BALANCE BETWEEN CT CONCRETE SKILLS AND TRANSFER IN [@kynigos_modifying_2020]


**LOA**

Turning  to a synthesis of my finding with those of Waite et al on levels of abstraction, while the teaching of the theories levels of abstraction is not explicit, movement is clearly happening, as demonstrated by the table below.


| **Level**            | **Focus** | **Example** |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Conceptual Level**  | Thinking about the GDPs to be added to the game | Goal formation, prioritisation |
| **Design Level**  | GDP supporting documentation scaffolds this process  | What it should do is to a large extent preset via documentation. |
| **Code Level**  | Writing the actual code, is supported via code patching  | is supported via code patching, and a structure which encourages modification |
| **Execution Level**  | Understanding the outputs | A strong correlation between goal and outcome, as playing the game product is very immediate. |

Table. 2.x Breakdown or Table of levels of abstraction. [@waite_abstraction_2018]


With this focus, we can analyse my learning design where movement between layers of abstraction and concrete is happening.

However, this is not a neat semantic sine wave.
Specifically the flexible nature of the design practices shows shifting rapidly and sometimes chaotically.


MERGE WITH BELOW SECTION - OR BE CLEAR HOW DIFFERENT DATA / ANALYSIS

**On intermediate analysis**

To explore the findings of last chapter in relation to this exploration of the nature and purpose of abstraction in guiding frameworks in learning programming, I return to research on the use of gameplay design patterns.

ANYTHING HERE ON REPENNING?

In the research of Eriksson et al on GDPs and young people co-revising an existing digital game with researchers [-@eriksson_using_2019], the positioning as GDPs as an intermediate construct between general theories and more concrete implementation. In their research, the nature of the general theories are not clearly articulated. This may in part be due to their decoupling of the problem-solution structure present in convention conceptions of design patterns to focus only on descriptions of patterns rather than any detail of solution. Thus the general theories may relate to the researchers field in practice, that of Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) [@lehnert_childcomputer_2022], as the theories of this domain  would be less accessible to children than their framework of a carefully chosen collection of GDPs.

In summary, Eriksson et al. note the utility of GDP concepts as a lingua franca, to help framing of analysis, to help the inspiration of participants. It should be noted that much of this analysis of the use of GDPs focused on the researcher perspective rather than that of participants.

Thus following section develops this line of research, making more explicit the observed and potential uses in participant game making, as tools by facilitator and researchers. It also explores more explicitly the positioning of GDPs as an intermediate framework between concrete code implementation and the more abstract frameworks articulated above.  


#### **Addressing utility for participants**

Recapping previous examples in vignettes. etc.  

In computing eduction pattern based instruction has benefits of making complex problems more modular and concrete [@muller_almost_2004-1; @waite_teaching_2021].

In terms of participant experiences, it is clear from this chapters findings that learners _are_ shifting between LOA without explicit in the process of the use of and contribution to this learning design.

The last chapter outlined the potential of GDP concepts, especially used within playtesting, to support these participant shifts in perspective.

Of particular relevance regarding the utility for learners in this domain of abstract/concrete domain would be in

   1. Goal formation - in ideation, prioritisation.
   2. Navigation, structuring of resources and docs - and in a holistic sense  
   3. Division of Labour - at times the more abstract processes are left to the more competent partner

Participant perspectives shift between the wider goal of making an engaging game for a real and imagined audience to a narrower goal of implementing a game design pattern and the technical actions and operations needed to complete it.

Reflections in progression of design in P4 showed my reluctance to lead with abstract concepts, and even in integrating them into the learning.map and documentation.

#### **Addressing utility for designers / teachers**

It follows that the concerns above are also relevant for designers who want to design for these aspects.

My reflections /data support a proposition that there is utility for **facilitators** to be aware of the level of abstraction both that present in different elements of project learning design and that of the concepts that learners are working with.

BUT WHAT ABOUT LEARNERS? HERE THE PERSPECTIVE IS BLURRED IF TEACHERS ARE STEERING TOWARDS A CURRICULUM.

As synthesis, in terms of semantic waves, the movement between abstract and concrete is helpful to address some of the issues concerning inclusion and accessibility of overly abstract approaches [@papert_epistemological_1990].

Waite and colleagues [@waite_abstraction_2018-1], also identify the intermediate design level of the LOA model as that suitable for supporting grounded abstraction in learner coding.
CAN THIS BE WRAPPED UP A BIT HERE? RESOLVE NEATLY? PRAGMATICALLY.

Different purposes and contexts of learning may require different interpretations, for example greater awareness of abstract concepts for reasons of assessment. According to [@barendregt_intermediate-level_2018], in their identification of design patterns as intermediate level construct, identifying a suitable the level of abstraction is recommended to best support the goals of learners FIND REASON.  

In this context I judged the imposition of an additional goal of understanding abstract curricular concepts as potentially counter productive to the overall aim of acculturation to game making tools and processes and developing an inclusive idioculture.

I had a reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge. My concern also reflected potential disorientation and reduced experiences of agency from imposed shifts of focus rather than self-initiated ones. I also propose that to further research to would be needed to justify the utility take the time to interrupt flow to explicitly teach abstraction, and abstract CT concepts, apart from if understanding of such concepts are required by curriculum constraints.

This question raises issues of how much CT is actually something that is explicitly taught or something which is picked up an embedded skill through a more bricolage approach.
As, the summary of the literature review paints a very mixed picture in terms of the value of the more abstract concepts of CT this steers us towards a no to the value of explicit teaching.



#### **Addressing utility/ findings for researchers and the field**

It's in the following section


### How my research contributes in this area - particularly in the conception of different pedagogies.

How then does this impact on conceptions of valuable pedagogies to help the development of coding fluency (NOTE THIS IS NOW MISSING FROM THE RQs)


#### Quick Re-framing of My pedagogical approach in a/c dimension

We now return to the question.

Q: What is abstraction and who useful for?
A: In this study. GDPs are useful as a inclusive, intermediate framework, with alignment between experience and abstractions of product.  


#### Comparing my pedagogical framing regarding dimensions of abstract/ concrete with existing research

The evidence and examples surfaced in this paragraph support a view of GDPs, as an productive intermediate-level framework and contributes a series of grounded pedagogical instances via examples.

Thus, one of the primary contributions of this research is as a case study which underlines this perspective and which importantly maps a concrete pedagogical process to support more theoretical observations.

Within this line of inquiry the characteristics would be:

- guide learners to use GDPs as their primary leading activity, or object in CHAT terms
- provide a documentation supporting structure aligned to these sub-goals
- if needed by the learning context provided a learning map to be used by participants and teachers

As such this research contends that as GDPs as potentially more productive and accessible pedagogical framework than that of computational thinking when making games.

It is productive to ask: how can the use of GDPs as a framework be compared to that of computational thinking given CT's is a dominance in this area?


However this does not detract from the value of learners navigating different LOA in following their interests.
Leading with GDPs as a framework appears to support this  navigation, and at times in this research it is undertaken fluently and joyfully.


**Applicable beyond this domain / new contributions to research area**

While the search for intermediate design concepts is applicable in other domains, how can this research contribute to this area of research?

- a stronger focus on participants and facilitators in this area.
- which creates a larger scope of use of GDPs than that imagined by Eriksson et al. which incorporates more social / cultural uses
- a experimental process led by participants in curating the menu of patterns (within limits set by facilitators)



<!-- While I address areas for future research in the conclusion, a proposed benefit of this research is While understanding the process is more obviously useful for facilitators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects. To underscore the potential and to uncover a starting point for pedagogies that can be transferred to diverse design projects. -->




### Link to next section and signposting final discussion section

MOVE - chapter 2? COMPRESS?
In Papert's research, detailed study of young coders evolving code creations and accompanying interview data allowed a close study of the personal appropriation, including elements of understanding, application and sharing back this knowledge via created and shared digital projects.

ADDRESSING THE RECENT SOCIAL / CULTURAL DIRECTION OF CONSTRUCTIONISM

Much subsequent research on the use of coding to develop both concrete and more abstract computational thinking skills, has neglected this social and perspectives [find source], instead focusing on a personal dimension of learning as a curricular skill to be absorbed and tested.

By way of contrast, this study is aligned with the development of the constructionist movement towards socio-cultural approaches to transcend individual personal conceptions of knowledge (exemplified by the problems associated with the UK computing curriculum)

The issue transcends issues of efficacy of how to support the coding process to address the underlying goals of the activity. While I align with the articulation of Resnick of computational fluency, (reactions to) this line of research has focused on toolsets rather than pedagogies (in a way which also frustrates Resnick [@resnick_seeds_2020]). These include physical computing, use of textiles [].

The work of Resnick is convincing but lacks theoretical foundations as Papert's ideas were before their time. It is of value to align them with more contemporary socio-cultural conceptions.

Additionally while the work of Waite and Sentence begins to address sociocultural aspects [@sentance_teaching_2019; @hwang_using_2023], this work integrates the aims of inclusion more closely within the project goals.

A process explored in the following section.



The final section of this chapter returns to a guiding question of pedagogies that can support the development of computational fluency and within that participant agency.



THE FOLLOWING SECTION ADDRESSES THIS THROUGH THE LENS OF X



## Part Two - Agency




### 2.a Affordances, Mediation, TADS,

1. recap on germ cell as common focus point for mediation (some designed or apporpirated)
2. When novel forms of mediation present, gdps sometimes used - thus as double stimulation
3. This is a transformation / expansion in 3GAT terms, recap as a resolution of tensions, and a manifestation of agency
4. Give a summary of examples of transformational agency
5. Briefly touch on the job of the learning designer within concept of F.I
6. The dilemma here of transformational happening most for participants in P1, and you can design OUT transformational agency, hence sketchy pedagogies.

<!-- 5. DROP /MOVE TO CH.3? The kedging metaphor and the climbing wall metaphor - in relation to agency and design -  explore them, kedging is a bit flailing , wall less so -->



A guiding principle of this section is that given the motivation (either primary or secondary) of participant empowerment in learning to program, and thus the value of designing and facilitating participant agency in the ongoing process, that it is profitable to articulate different types of agency.

Chapter 5  exposed the tensions that developed in the activity systems and subsequent evolution the tools used include code authoring environment, supporting resources of printed and digital format.

This section analyses these tensions and presents related finding using varied conceptions of agency aligned to the sociocultural theoretical framework of this study.




<!-- ### Justifying the use of Metaphors in these FINDINGS - CONCLUSION?

A mixed readership for this research is hoped for as relevant to pracitioners and some of the break down of agency is quite academic in tone and potentialy opaque.

There is a good tradition of metaphors in this space with Papert's low thresholds, high ceilings and wide walls concept. INSERT IN LR, PERHAPS IN TRANSITION FROM MICROWORLDS TO SCRATCH AND DESIGN BUILD TEST GAME MAKING.  

Metaphors are another vehicle to explore concepts, and different means of representation are a valid from of inclusive communication [UDL link]   -->




### The use of concepts of mediation and dual stimulation in this exploration of the development of agency -

As previously explored, varied conceptions of agency exist including: instrumental, authorial and transformative agency [@matusov_mapping_2016]. (See methodology chapter).

<!-- This section explores these conceptions using the core AT concepts of mediation and dual stimulation explored in Chapter 3 to illuminate pedagogical development related to the interaction of designed and emergent tools and processes, shedding light on dimensions of participant agency. -->

To summarise similarities and distinctions between mediation and double stimulation  [@isaac_cultural_2022], it is beyond an instrumental approach to provoke change in the enviroment.

<!-- Hopwood [@hopwood_agency_2022] explores varied interpretations between mediation and double stimulation, exposing varied interpretations of mediation and ds's special interpretation by Sannino, and the difficulties of then comparing the models of agency.     -->


<!-- DROP?
While the affordances built into the code playground are valid secondary stimuli in initial in helping to seed initial activity,
supporting documentation can be seen as a form of secondary stimulation more aligned to the process of building agency. -->




<!-- RETURNING TO THE TENSIONS OF AUTHENCITY IN CH.5 AND TABLE AND IMPACT ON AGENCY. -->
<!-- Other tensions were resolved with more fundamental shifts to the overall structure of the activity which can be said to align more closely with the concept of transformative (authorial agency) agency.
In many cases design decisions were driven by the response and interest of the participants.

<!-- REMOVE THIS DUPLICATE EXAMPLE .
For example in my design:
Introducing additional tools in the form of documentation to the initial coding environment and template provided in early stages introduced tensions between the opportunities for independent development and the additional complexity of the process. -->

### Summary of examples of transformational agency and instrumental agency

This takes a conservative view of TA, as something new to the learning design, not just new to teh learner. This is explored later, next section on relational agency.  


**Instrumental**
Examples of mediation and instrumental agency are shown in varied forms in the use of GDPs aligned often with a personal appropriation.

Straight forward indidual use of documentation by Tony and Susanna in V1 and V2.

**Transformational.**

In P1, (see Chapter 5 (check)) the initial use of GDPs as a planning tool, and as a vehicle for prototypical documentation.

In Vig. Dave, the breaking out of the template to create a different genre.


### Designing for increased instrumental agency and then for TA?

Integrate research on engendering authorial and transformative agency [@engestrom2006development; @haapasaari_emergence_2016; @sannino_formative_2016].



DOWN PLAY THIS - MOVE LATER. IT'S NOT IDEAL ANYWAY WITH MEDIATION - IT'S MORE THE NEXT SECTION.

DROP THIS METAPHOR?
The role of the designer  in this metaphor is to structure the climber journey to the top.

This my be done by
- defining or reducing the use of specialised terminology  or
<!-- - hiding away un-needed complexity. -->
- signposting issues   
<!-- - imagining the lines of sight of the learner. try to remove large obstacles to potential anchour points. -->


### Dilemma / Tension for the facilitator, how sketchy to make the design?

The dilemma here of transformational happening most for participants in P1, and you can design OUT transformational agency, hence sketchy pedagogies


1. Shifting forms of agency
2. Danger of the design being too complete, a concept of sketchy pedagogy

From TA in P1
To relational in P2
Increased support for relational in P3


#### Danger of designing away the possibility for transformational agency

One of my drivers in this research was to better understand my love of sketch, chaotic learning environments.

The contrast of mediational based, instrumental agency of a more completed learning design and the more exploratory, experimental process of P1.

<!-- Adopting analysis which aligns authorial agency and transformative agency,  -->

There is a potential tension between instrumental agency and transformative agency. A design which minimises possible conflicts also reduces the potential for participants to solve them both individually and collective responses.


As a learning designer, design decisions to reduce practical tensions, increase the instrumental agency of learners allowing them to experience a feeling of control over their creative process.

Later participants have less opportunity for transformative agency in terms of how their input transforms the context and structure of the learning design.  

This invites a question: is nurturing transformative agency by creating space for emergent practices sustainable or desireable for ongoing iterations?

How much of the learning design can/should be transferred to other settings.

In terms of desirability, as a personal refection while I love this aspect, but others can find it stressful. Different strokes.



<!--
NEEDED: MORE SYNTHESIS / DISCUSSION ON Instrumental agency, TRANFORMATIONAL AGENCY AND AUTHORIAL AGENCY IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS WORK ON METHODOLOGY. -->

INTEGRATE SOME OF THIS INTO THE SECTIONS OR THE DISCUSSION ABOVE ON

A possible


To retain this potential for transformation
it may be advantageous to keep some key areas of the learning design should be more open in structure to encourage the emergence of participant responses and novel practices.

And the danger of being too instrumental if the design is too complete.

A danger that my interest and focus on messy / sketchy pedagogies would try to avoid. But which has wider implications in terms of inclusion and levels of stress for participants.


**Shifting forms of agency.**
How different forms of  agency are developed and transform over iterations of this game making programme  

Initial blocks are solved by heroic transformative agency of parents, children and facilitator.

Then patterns and tools become established in the community, and agency shifts to be less authorial and more instrumental and relational.



### 2b - Emergent activities in emergent cultural context - TAS, 3rd Spaces, Col, Fok, idiocultures etc.

MERGE THIS PLAN WITH ABOVE - NOT 2A AND 2B.


This need restructuring

2. value of different Metaphors - types of spaces,  habour, playground / sandbox - used for different reasons but all about ecological aspects
3. Harbour, walled garden, restrictions  and authenticity in tool use

4. Examples in relation to the role of playtesting / playground to develop identity in a safe space, reduced stress, but with an important aspect of social interaction and norming






### Intro to this section - space / place related conceptions of agency

In the last section using TADS and mediation helps analyse findings in personal and guided participation aspects of Chapter 6. This section moves beyond TA to a wider more ecological interpretation of agency helpful in deeper analysis of the cultural plane of activity.

POSSIBLY?
This helps inform a distinction between FI and SDE,
Whereas FI do x, SDE do y? <- too much..

In research which addresses transformative agency, Gutiérrez et al. [@gutierrez_youth_2019-1] incorporate broader cultural factors including issues of participant identity and movement of practices between learning settings, in ways which are not generally explored in Change Labs approaches.  

While this framings includes concepts already explored in sociocultural field including CoP, CoL, this section is structured around the previously described concepts of idiocultures [Cole], and repertoires of practice. Specifically positioning the idioculture of the game making program as a sum of emerging repertoires of practice of participants and practitioners.

This section begins with a closer look at playtesting as a medium of development of practices, a mini third space

#### Discussion on the role of playtesting in particular as a suitable medium (third space)

<!-- HOW MUCH OF THIS COULD LIVE IN CHAPTER 7 AS A AGENCY / PLAYTESTING SECTION? -->
<!--
HOW TO KEEP THE MOST VALUABLE PART OF THIS SECTION - IMPLICATIONS FOR AGENCY AND FOR IDENTITY - AND INCLUSION / PARTICIPATION
**On playtesting behaviours and interaction with GDP findings** -->

<!-- DO I? IS THIS NOT PART OF CHAPTER 6? -->

As explored in the literature review, playtesting is a process common to game making which corresponds to the evaluation phase of design thinking cycles and the process of user testing in HCI [@fullerton_game_2018].

In this section, I recall data to describe some of the emerging playtesting behaviours of participants in relation to the introduced learning design.


I propose that the evolving idioculture, playtesting in particular, has been crucial to the development of this design. The learning design sprang from emergent activities.
Not only the cultural uses of GDPs, but other processes (DO i ACTUALLY HAVE ANY OF THESE IN EVIDENCE? )

As such, the nature and process of this community evolution merits exploration.



<!-- #### on alien chat
Perhaps add back in as an unintended consequence?
The live chat process started unintentionally as one child was left to their own devices as a parent was undertaking a social mission (see below and previous chapter). -->

#### Further Observations on repertoires playtesting / space based understandings


**More on Funds of Knowledge / repertoires and how they emerge in my research**

Other research by Gutierrez addresses the importance of FoK via the metaphor of movement between sites of activity, aligning with the concept of movement between activity systems in 3GAT [ENGESTROM FROM GUTIERREZ]

The data of this study provides a supporting evidence and detail to this process in the development of a game making idioculture.

This can be analysed in relation to existing, evolving understandings of FoK and repertoires as incorporation of different repertoires.

Thus transformation is happening here but not in a revolutionary way. It is more of a blend of practices.
In my data this happens in vignette data we can see elements of personal interest of young people, of home education collaborative work patterns, and of practices introduced by the facilitator from professional and educational contexts.  

While the data in the last chapter address aspects / elements of repertoires which incorporated GDPs not all of them directly relate. The follow example of playful playtesting is one not directly involving GDPs.

**Playful playtesting**

I observed an evolution of the form and function of playtesting by young participants as an expression of agency by participants. The link to maker types here exists especially in social makers, glitchers and magpies.

Some children added additional playful elements to playtesting.
Some in particular brought a physicality to the process.

See Appendix.playtestingtypes

The process of play testing as a cultural process is explored in more depth now.

#### Use of GDPs in supporting Playtesting (including player types and side missions)


One GDPs are identifies as a useful tactic of navigation and as a bridging strategy to wider repertoires, then this can inform process of supporting the development participants to assemble their own repertoires of practice in this new setting.

In this design, as outlined in Chapter 5 and Appendix.drama I used a drama narrative, with side missions and the concept of player types to do this. This matches research of 5D and in particular that of Gutiérrez in conceptions of processes of inclusion.


<!-- By the time phase three and video capture of data was underway, the process of playtesting began to take on interesting characteristics for some younger participants who were working more independently. -->
<!-- Because these interactions were mobile between works is it hard to transcribe interactions. However, description of the physical movement and gestures of the young people is relevant to explore the value of this behaviour which I will call playful playtesting.  -->

 <!-- Examples include.... -->



 If playtesting is an incubator for emerging socio cultural practices, can suitable affordances be added to encourage their growth?

**Maker Types and slide missions**

The use of GDPs in different ways and diverse ways between participants provoke an exploration of maker types, a reflection fed back into the design. (see Appendix .makertypes )

The identification of maker types, and incorporation of those concepts into the design and faciliation  

<!-- **beyond primary and secondary tools / stimulation conception**

<!-- There may have been a response to draw in one of the younger participants who had on parent partner and who was brought along by another parent. -->
<!-- NOTE - Nadine's play on secret missions mirrors some of her more spontaneous play in the previous phase - thus one informs other -->

### Metaphors of harbours and playgrounds as a way to explore conceptions of (relational) agency


#### Utility of metaphors of space

The use of metaphor here has two functions. The first is to help deepen my analysis via a move to the abstract, to search for communicable generalisations. Secondly, given the non-traditional nature of this approach, and bearing in mind previous reflections on the difficulty of communicating approaches to practitioners (e.g Microworld by Kynigos), I draw on metaphors as a supporting tool. One in line with utopian methodology proposed by Cole and Gutierrez.  

In this case metaphors concerning learning spaces and movement between spaces are often found in existing research including: walled gardens, playgrounds, sandboxes, harbours. This section aims to draw from these metaphors relatable core principles which may help the impact of this research.

#### Harbours - authentic and restrictive


**Design as simplification**

Many design decisions were made to create a supported, simplified coding environment. Relevant examples from the previous chapter include: using an online code playground; skirting use of specialist terminology; hiding away un-needed complexity in the code template.

The motivations for creating starter templates are similar for both educators and professional template creators. The goal being to want to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency.  

This strong alignment with authentic, professional practice may help learners transition to other forms of web coding projects, due to the similarity of as this element of practice.
CH.5

My design decision to build the toolset as structure on top of authentic tools and languages can be likened to creating a protective harbour to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency.

**The magic of working in authentic waters**

The intrigue  of opening up previously mysterious areas and seeing or experimenting with what makes them tick is explored in Ch.2.

The same principle applies here in early stages of the learning experience. The process of clicking remix to fix a broken, half baked game involves viewing and altering code in unfamiliar territory, even if the code template has been simplified it is still an authentic tool set, and thus motivational [FIND SOURCE]

**The same value of protection from a complex environment applies to accessing documentation.**

Participants are able to leave the protective harbour by accessing more authentic documentation and moving beyond existing templates. The experience may be involve choppier waters but the tools and processes remain familiar.


While it is important to acknowledge the danger that such support may make learners run into trouble if coding other projects outside of this supported space, the use of authentic code language makes this less of an issues than with specialised coding environments aimed at novices [@hagge_coding_2018]. Thus to make one addition to the metaphor this design is like a sea-harbour, tools like Scratch are like a swimming pool.

This curated replication of authentic process of finding and incorporating code snippets into the starting template supported the development of skills used in professional coding communities.

**Another example**

Also participants can change the genre, See Toby and Dan in Vignette x.

#### Playgrounds, sandboxes and play spaces

<!-- The freedoms and restrictions of playgrounds -->

A similar metaphorical dimension of protection is present in metaphors of play spaces. The web-based environment which reduce the complexity of web development and provide community and immediate feedback are named code playgrounds.

Additionally, the process of checking the performance of games is called play-testing.

Additionally, there are the connotations of a playful, and therefore social space, and the presence of affordances suggesting a particular form of action. For example a roundabout, or climbing frame in a playground invites a certain kind of interaction.


Thus in the design of this study

- template affordences,
- GDP menu as affordences

Other affordances of the design would encourage greater authorial (and relational agency), for example those designed to build user's sense of belonging in the game making community.

In this research, similar metaphors have emerged in the pedagogical and technical process surrounding the concept of playgrounds and gardens. In the previous section the use of a curated set of design patterns can be thought of as play areas or equipemtn inviting interaction.


**Games and play spaces**

These metaphors invite a connection to play theories concept of as the magic circle. Play theorist outline the value of stepping into a more controlled area of voluntary experimentation where the fear of failure is reduced. Game rules are norms which seed participation in community processes.

The concepts of affective space and magic circle  as a way to encourage participants to improvise from a starting structure are of value to provide guidance to practitioners in the domain of informal digital design.

The playful context of the game's magic circle can facilitate participants to adapt norms and rules to their own playing styles. Through this lens, the interaction of playtesting, code playgrounds and a sandbox of game patterns emerge as a key practices to facilitate and maintain learner agency. The discussion of the next chapter explores the intersection of these elements in more detail.

**Freedom to fail**

The sandbox metaphor is used extensively in web development to indicate a safety in terms of non-critical space to trial new code and make mistakes.

**Freedom to adapt play and games**

While the play space evokes protection, there is still space for wilder behaviors to emerge as play is responsive and adaptive. In this study playtesting spaces are important as a means to allow learners to evolve their own processes as a form of authorial and transformational agency, albeit within the suggested limitations.





### A complex view of agency and repertoires development within Idiocultures / 3rd spaces

In this section, instead of agency as a individualised property, agency is participation in a community.

The conception of development of repertoires of practices is key to this interpretation.

While development of relational agency is a part of the social and cultural aspects of repertoires development, this section moves beyond agency to explore issues of equity and diversity as concrete instances with the learning environment.

As such, I draw on concrete examples in my research as a contribution to applied research in this promising field.


#### The importance of identity development in the designs

The examples of the previous chapter, particularly in the cultural plane show the value and means of developing participant identities.

This aligns with in 5D, Gutierrez, and extends the research in the area of non-formal exploration of tech by providing a guiding framework using design patterns.

Example of alignment.

Example of how extending with DPs as a framework could be fruitful, developing and synthesising last chapter arguments.



#### Relational Agency in response to a series of stimuli participant identity

WHAT IS THE KEY POINT HERE?

The use of GDPs helped the goal of x in y ways.
One element of the repertoires.
Beyond that... social missions?
The style of making, the type.


Gutierrez and Stone [@stone_problem_2007-2] underline the importance of "opportunities to transform learner identities needed for zones of competency" as something that can and should be designed into inclusive learning environments (focusing on goal development).

Relational agency in developing expertise is shown in many of the vignettes.

Learner agency in the form of choice over the  chosen activity is present not only in the dimensions of the difficulty and theme of the game features they wished to add, but also in their approach to undertaking it.

**Recap on data on  / exploration of maker types**
Some approached objectives in a methodical manner, others socially and others embracing a playfully disruptive stance. Some decided to focus extensively on the creation and implementation of graphical assets and level design.

Learners who had mastered the skills were asked by others for help, becoming domain experts, and thus providing additional affordances in the learning community and building an identify as specialist within it.

While the use of social missions is not novel,

My contribution is that using GDPs as a framework helps this process.




### Discussion on what are we really designing for here?

Emerging section.


#### Returning to transformational agency here and how it different from conceptions of developing repertoires of practice

**How can we best conceive agency here?**

How structural and permanent does transformational agency needs to be before it becomes transformational compared to a more blended view of emerging repertoires of practice.

Conceptions of AT are evolving including a 4th generation which responds to increasingly rapid and evolving situations.
See
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10749039.2020.1806328#d1e455

##### Examining complexity using identity formation and specialisation

It is of value to examine specialisation as a form of agency and identity formation using different lenses.

It can be seen through the lens of double stimulation. The choice to specialise, marks a form of transformative agency. Participants craft for themselves a specialist status which becomes shared and celebrated by the group.

Or, perhaps more accurately here as a movement between activity systems, to be incorporated as a repertoire.

These repertoires become public, and are in part socially motivated, via the process of playtesting.

Thus the specialisation becomes a kind of relational agency for the learning environment as a whole. It exists as a form of identity within an individuals repertoire and for others to draw on as an affordence of the learning system.



#### for Transformational agency, fluidity of practice of participants for characteristics of an emerging inclusive, ideoculture

What is the end goal that I have been designing for?

Am I designing for agency, varied forms of agency in individuals

Or  is that missing the point, is the overall environment what should be designed for?

What is my contribution to research based on this questions. Are there different things I am suggesting?

My end goal is a creative, emerging, inclusive ideoculture, and the use of GDPs here is one means to achieve it.
NOT the only one.


**Is it Fluency?**

Is it jamming? A sense of flow?

While the distributed nature of the toolset, hindered peer learning in P1 as too many tools were introduced, in P2 it helped build authentic digital literacy skills. Some young participants became remarkably swift and adapt at thus transforming chains of actions into a fluid operation.


Hence the next section. An attempt a synthesis.


## Part Three : Synthesis in relation to Issues of inclusive pedagogy UDL, UMC, MOE, PBL.



- Synthesis of characteristics; step based / template, Germ cell GDPs, playtesting as medium for develoment of idioculture,
- Final analysis with UMC, UDL, MOE - bring complexity here - perhaps bring the metaphors here instead.
- Celebrate the process of bricolage in this research.

<!-- - Role of the methodology / DBR . FI to bring this process / analysis out - MOVE EARLIER.  -->

TO INTEGRATE?

The role of the emerging culture and identity of the idioculture  is developed in this chapter in the following ways:

- the impact / if any of the social missions and player types to help the development of learner identities.

- the emergence and nurturing of flexible and complex design behaviours (beyond player types)



### The interaction of flexible deign practices, the collection of Game Design Patterns, stepwise scaffolding of learning environments and new understandings of agency.

<!-- BRING IN A SUMMARY OF LEARNING FROM THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER ON GDPS. -->

In the previous chapter we explored the use of GDPs as a possible response to the challenges to project work and the lack of domain specific frameworks. The nature of the framework provided by game play design patterns has been be explored through the lens of agency.

This section synthesises the learning design with such interpretations.

And then progresses to recap the potential of this synthesis of these process, framed in other writing as a 3M approach.

Finally it links the the outputs with the research process in terms of the impact of DBR and formative intervention approaches.

#### Summary of observations contributions of novel aspect of the learning design (PERHAPS MERGE WITH BELOW)

While the base structuring of the starting template drew on concepts of UMC and half-baked game design, the use of a menu of GDPs to scaffold the modify and create stage is a novel approach.

The potential of this innovation is significant in scope. Firstly, the surfacing of GDPs as a germ cell concept, facilitated the developmetn of in different "stepped" progressively graded project briefs which build one upon the other as a flexible scaffold (HOW?), in a way which helps address the tension between freedom of choice of learner pathway, and expression of interest within a manageable technical structure (with relevant supporting documentation).

This alignment with a  rhizomatic approach within a structure has been explored in this thesis using a metaphor of a harbour in terms of the conceptualisation of the design from a facilitator / designers point of view. The habour walls represent the restrictive decisions in terms of the genre of end product, and simplifications in code structures participants must understand or create to make progress.

From a participants' perspective I liken their experience to the process of jamming an informal musical practice.



While The value of playtesting as a practice is surfaced either explicitly in professional game making

Other sections of this research The use of social missions to support the variety of development.


#### Synthesis of Characteristics and Analysis in relation to what they contribute to existing frameworks

-



- The role of authenticity and the impact on agency


These varied forms of documentation, and their varied adoption and propagation represent different approaches to  scaffolding the process of becoming familiar with and then modifying to the code in often increasingly ambitious ways inline with the stages and ethos of a



- UDL / PBL

Key characteristics of structuring support around quick start activities and a subsequent menu of GDPs which align with existing research include:

The use of a menu / collection of resources can be considered an inclusive educational practice and offer a rich description of a concrete example which aims to align to inclusive, practice-based frameworks like UDL and PBL. While this may involve more work in advance, the benefits to inclusive practice merit it.

### Addressing the nature of my contribution to research landscape

The section above outlined contributions to the research landscape intersecting with the development of the learning design of the study.

A critique could be leveled against this contribution that the alignment with existing pedagogical frameworks suggests a more minimal contribution: representing a kind of _tinkering around the edges_ of existing work.

While I hope the framing of the previous section of the novel positioning of those concepts within new context addresses this concern, the challenging of such an interpretation is also an important motivational concern of this work.  

In line with a tradition of other researchers, this work celebrates the creative value of a bricolage approach [], or in other words a "re-mediatation" of the existing forms of pedagogies.

It is from the concrete, practical, collaborative struggle of how to jointly make a game making community and to build fluency in the process of making games that this research emerges. And as such the concrete, responsive, re-assembling of existing pedagogies and elements of the learning activity systems is a integral tactic here aligned with a recent socio-cultural concerns.  

_This shift from “fixing” the individual to re-mediating and transforming the functional system is key to reimagining new
forms of learning and doing science that are tied to the imaginings of new futures, trajectories, and identities (Gutierrez, Morales, & Martinez, 2009) [@gutierrez_re-mediating_2009-2] in [@gutierrezpossibilities2015-1]_


However it is of value to explore how transferrable these findings are to other contexts of learning, and other genres of digital making, or beyond to other project based approaches.

#### Questions and  Conceptual challenges to dissemination - MOVE PERHAPS TO NEXT CHAPTER?

**How broadly can the principles be applied?**

The general use of design patterns to guide digital creation are widely replicable, that of coupling documentation. The UMC methodology applies more broadly to design based education via prototyping. which could take other formats. Thus it is potentially applicable to other domains. And example of such is in PBL work using a campaign template and characteristics ads design patters, and a Poster, and elevator pitch feedback before creating then a stall [blog post].

<!-- I start o. A low concrete level in supporting game making Fluency
And get wider in application to broader approaches of pbl  and research processes (if found) -->


**Complexity of the findings and emerging pedagogy**

Beyond practical aspects of dissemination, a further challenge associated with the overall goal of bringing a complex, flexible, learner-driven pedagogy to bear, is addressed by Kynigos , in articulating the limitation of updake of ideas surrounding Microworlds.

There are a lot of moving parts in the final pedagogy and while I have put in work to address foundational aspects using relatable metaphors, the target audience in terms of coding enviroment designers, represents challenges in terms of complexity.  


I do brand it , and provide useful contributions in concrete instances of work

<!-- This decreased need for secondary documentation minimises the possibility for task / tool mismatch.  As outlined above, to avoid the barriers experienced when searching authentic, developer-focused documentation and the support forums, I created  bespoke code examples in an online collection. -->



## Conclusion



**Wrapping up in narrative?**

In AT terminology, this chapter has in a general sense returned to the concrete (see Marx / Blunden).

Chapter four outlined a design narrative where tools were chosen and adapted by myself and Participants in response to local context. Chapter five explored the emerging organisational unit of GDPs, and how they were used as meditational strategies.  

This chapter has explored emergent cultural and community activity, and deepened discussion on interpersonal activity, and then returned to discuss implications for dimensions of concrete tool use on learner agency.

It's dialectic innit. We call it praxis.

The methodology chapter outlined some of the challenges of this approach, particularly in the thick description of context, and the challenge of then satisfying the goal of generalisability / and overall utitlity.

The final chapters aims to address this with  recommendations for facilitators and researchers. The scope of the applicability is addressed as the findings of this thesis can inform the wider debate of how to best support project based learning in wider domains. Specifically the use of concrete design frameworks and step-based iterative project in scaffolding PBL.

## TO MOVE OR DROP FROM CHAPTER



### On planned and emergent activity)

MOVE TO A DISCUSSION SECTION?
COMPRESS FOR INTRO?
THIS IS PART OF DBR - REFERENCE THAT IF IT IS STILL NEEDED FOR THE CHAPTER.



The previous chapters have described interventions in design that can be characterised on a spectrum between those planned and introduced by myself as a facilitator and those which were emergent, i.e. invented or adopted by participants as a response to the contradictions covered in chapter four.  

The distinction between planned and emergent activities became blurred as practices merged. In Chapter 6 outlines that while  I tool a lead to collate game design patterns into an organised collection with accompanying resources and a navigational menu, many of these patterns, were introduced  initially by participants who recognised them and wanted to add them to their own games.

This aligns with a key characteristic of formative intervention and DBR. Namely that elements of the introduced design changed responsive to learner need as the design evolved through iterations. Some introduced  processes outlined in this chapter were very minimal in embryonic form but extended significantly by participants.


AT theory emphasises that the process of activity does not start in a vacuum. This helps justify the formative intervention process which is active in intervention and in the initial shaping of activity. In an educational context, this can involve introduction of tasks as starting activities to shape. This is justified conceptually from a view of not restricting participant agency in that some form of activity should be suggested in order for them to make a rational choice as to weather to participate. It follows that this activity should encourage the communication that participant choice is significant in the design.

<!-- **Expectations- ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**
- incorporating familiar or personally meaningful elements can involve challenges including that of unrealistic expectations based on previous game playing experiences -->






<!-- NOTE - NOTES ON THE CULTURE OF HARDNESSS - FIT IN SOMEWHERE IF APPROPRIATE

When explored from game making perspective the hard is good lens, is limiting in terms of building the engagement of players. However, culturally the desire to make games hard for other participants is more understandable in the context of retro games. .

- arcade games were designed to be hard to extract money from players
- nes games reputation for being brutal as they often had no way to save states, and much of the games challenge, due to limitations of number of levels or modes of playing, depended on this 'hardness'
- this developed later for snes games , finding challenge and other forms of ways of maintaining interest for different genres of games_
- retro games are associated therefore with being brutal and frustrating.
- thus in some ways the process of making a hard game is a way of getting your own back at all the games that have frustrated

### Building Identities as Game Makers  - EXTENDED

PARK THIS FOR NOW IN DESIGN CHAPER

COULD RETURN TO THIS IN A DISCUSSION CHAPTER - AS HAS IMPACT ON GDP TOO.

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with the positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you. -->

   - Game playing at start of program - no observations but sets context
   - Play testing - and challenge - a culture of "hardness", curiosity about number of levels, as a vehicle for peer support,

- Drama Process
 - differencing attitudes to games and technology
 - a reflective process to avoid distracting from activity & to share goals and process publically

Highlighting and supporting these more naturally emerging roles behaviours may be more useful  (explain - well aligned to creating a game making community?) to facilitators in informal environments that the more prescriptive roles in pedagogies like pair programming.

<!--
MOVE THIS SOMEHOW INTO A DISCUSSION AREA
#### Helpers supporting supportive community behaviours

While not a key part of this study, it is of value to briefly examine the role of student helpers in this phase.
One of their remits was to support the work of participants and to guide reflection by asking simple questions like "What have you been working on?", What are you working on now. What do you want to add to your game. Beyond this, students also gave feedback between playtestings sessions, connected different participants, supported parental behaviours,   into the design process via debriefing sessions. In journal notes I made observations and gathered feedback, while not fo extensively studied there is potential here.
Especialy in the potential to replicate family supportive behaviours with non-expert facilitators in a volunteering settings, specifically with bespoke guidance to support game making.

In one interaction child Ne visits the page to add a mechanic, starts to scan it, highlights some code, but then seems to change her mind
- perhaps recognising limits - or fearing the process of breaking her game - and returns to more familiar territory of changing game assets and level design.

<!-- #### Discussion on design stages and GDP for this pair - DROP THIS?

 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.
 This parent was much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents. The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker/player type (concepts explored in previous chapter). This interpretation seems confirmed by less social interactions compared to may parents. The pair engaged far less in play testing of other games and peer support to overcome barriers. They also followed the stages of design more closely than may other groupings, an observation which is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

 This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." This alternation is driven or facilitated by the different stages of implementing GDPs. The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

 Using the coded data from nvivo to compare design cycle stages with pair collaboration, it can be observed that the most likely stages for pair collaboration were during the Ask/Imagine stage, Testing and Planning.

 The vignette shows evidence of that the actions of the parent to re-engage the child at different stages of the design cycle helped sustain the child's engagement in the more focused design process happening on the screen. However, an opposing pattern of behaviour may also be valid. When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups. Within Rogoff's model of community of learners [-@rogoff_developing_1994], this observation is viewed as valid form of participation. The child's ability to legitimately disengage from pair coding to observe the work and interactions of others in this emerging community of learners may also be sustaining.

 It is of note that when describing the design cycle for this family that this family along with others are working with decomposed smaller design challenges in the form of implementing GDPs. Thus the cycle is repeated for each new pattern that the pair take on. These smaller design iterations can be expressed within the framework of AT as an activity system. -->

 <!-- #### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

 NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION?
  NOTE - This more general observation may be part of the previous chapter

 We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

 - The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
 - This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

 Discussion

 - The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

 The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity. -->

<!-- This chapter has explored the affordances and potential of selected tools and processes in the context of in-person, family-based, game coding.

<!-- These include; authenticity of programming environment and language, use of the existing structure of the phaser library, the learning process of participants getting stuck and having to resolve tensions, my time limits providing individual support as a facilitator of a group, and the patience of participants when they encounter incomplete documentation. -->

<!-- While some areas of the design emerged in phase one, became a stable part of the design, (for example template and supporting documentation) other processes remained more flexible to interpretation and direction by participants; , playtesting, division of labour and use of home interests.   -->

While this has tricky implications for practitioners in more formal settings, there are tactics and tools which can help.

<!-- Because of the common use of design stages as a conceptual design tool.
And a prevalence of research linking design thinking  stages  and coding. I coded data to that. When coding data a design cycle framework was one of the code structures. Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share. However, when coding I quick became aware that naturalistic practice rarely matched the progression of the design cycle. The stages were instead fragmented and sometimes happened in parallel. -->


<!-- When designing program to prioritise learner engagement on to respond to their interests I found over structuring activity via design stages may be not be productive. The emerging process in this design related more closely to tinkering methodologies (previous explored). -->

<!-- #### Designing to incorporate learner identity

NOTE - INCLUDE HOME ED CONTEXT TO AN EXTENT TO PRECEED LATER CAVEATS IN CONCLUSION

Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].

This chapter supports this research and also finds game making as  a suitable medium to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

Conceptually, within AT, these interventions and design choices which yield possibilities for self-exploration can be see as potential anchor points to increase learner agency.

In summary:

Family game making, of completing projects together with your parents or siblings has potential to remove the **I'm not that sort of person** barrier of cultural identity as participants are surrounded by their people.

  - the choice of retro games as a medium provokes sharing for older participants while their enduring popularity maintains common ground with younger participants;

This distinction is fluid as some tools and processes which emerged in community practice, prove to be successful and which are then adopted as a suggested process for the next iteration of the design.

<!-- #### A game encouraging maker / player types

The drama process work in P3 to develop ways to encourage diverse and playful approaches to making had its roots in a game introduced in P2 where participants took part in an interactive the Bartle test. The Bartle test draws on work which ...

The full process and rationale and initial reactions are detailed in appendix 4.x . In summary,

The process was very engaging, parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital identities of their children. As part of the process I then proposed that there different game maker types and asked participants to evaluate and discuss with peers what kind of game maker they were. From the following list.

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users


DATA REQUIRED FROM VIDEO!?

This self evaluation helped confirm my own observations of different motivations driving different participation behaviours. Fuller discussion follows in chapter six.

The success of activity spurred the creation of the creation of side-missions to be carried out in from of a dramatic process.

### On Fluency

For example, creating a new graphical element in a separate online pixel-art editor called Piskel, exporting and downloading it to the laptop, and uploading it to the glitch code playground and then making code changes in several parts of the code to initialise and implement new behaviour for this element.

**A tension in use of norming practices and participant choice?**
However, as a seeming counterpoint to this growing agency is the norming effects of concepts that gain community currency in playtesting. The repeated attempts by participants to make the jumping mechanic of Molly less frustrating can be seen as a potential drag on the agency or autonomy of Molly as a designer. However this may be a false dichotomy. Such norming practices can be seen from a different perspective according to Rogoff, as a productive nudge to get real.

#### Community concepts and norming behaviour emerging during playtesting

MOVE BACK TO CHAPTER 6 IF SPACE?

NOTE THERE IS SOMETHING HERE ABOUT ME STEPPING BACK AND LETTING THE COMMUNITY EVOLVE.

Ed gives a more technical explanation from  involving the naming of the variable _jump speed_.

Other children come and play the game but only for less than a minute before leaving. Towards the end of the playtesting process, as one child leaves, Molly comments "It's so frustrating." This suggests an evolving understanding that her game is frustrating to players rather than pleasantly challenging.

The indirect norming behaviours described in appendix 5.Norm.x mirror observations seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues [@rogoff_cultural_2003] on learning in  community settings.

There is an apparent tension in play here between encouraging individual agency of expression within the game and an evolving community tendency to norm peoples games to be more _playable_, specifically that player movement should conforming to wider expectations.

What we can draw from the data at this stage is that playtesing provides many leverage points to facilitating learner agency and discuss the limits of designs. IN addition, playtesting is a process that allows participants to demonstrate informed criticality as a player and guide the creations of peers via gameplay feedback.

This process is an example of an emerging process where cultural concepts are mutually constituted by all actors involved in the game making activity system. While the concepts of hardness and challenge that emerge and not concrete examples of GDPS, they are the results of changed GDPs. The next chapter explores similar data on the use of GDP related concepts by participants and the resultant potential impact on participant agency.


<!-- #### Why prioritise local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community - and how are they different in character? PERHAPS DROP IF NOT NEEDED OR KEEP REALLY SHORT. AND MERGE UP.

While a lot of other research has focused on community as an online phenomenon, in this research that aspect has not been explored.

This section explores my decision to prioritise local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community as well as  how are they different in character.

One reason was practical,  a suitable online community pitched at children or even at novices was not apparent using the chosen tools set.

The advantages of this decision is that interactions play out off the screen, the limited games available increase community interaction, as participants drew only from a small pool of locally created games.

While there is convincing research on on how online community  can engender feelings of agency and motivation [ROQUE AND ITO AND GEE], I chose not to connect with existing online communities in this learning design. Online communities can serve as a form of authentic feedback as explored in the Scratch and New Grounds community websites. However, the process of being involved in an online community and in addition learning the processes of participation diverts time and focus from other activities including real life playtesting.

In addition, the diversity of creations available on a online community may also have detracted from the more shared experience of the template used. Not offering a choice of starting game helped this shared technical and cultural base.      -->



####  MoE

One area of research which was explored in this learning design but which has needed to be deprioritise is that of Mantle of the Expert and the permission to play and experiment which the drama process advocates.

While a fuller exploration of how this was put into practice in P3 via a narrative which wrapped around the making activity, it is relevant to the use of side missions, and the possibility for character exploration in terms of a maker type.

### Affordances as points on a climbing wall to support understandings of instrumental agency - MOVE

<!-- In the original metaphor the casting of the anchor is random, experimental. It is unsure if the anchor will catch on anything under the surface. However,  -->

The exploration of tensions in Chapter 5 summary, design decisions of tool use can to increase agency in practical terms by providing affordances or by removing barriers to use. Conceptually these practical dimension can be framed as instrumental agency or removing aspects of negative liberty caused by technical barriers [@matusov_mapping_2016, p. 433].
But may remove authorial or relational agency.

As an example take the tensions surrounding  authenticity of coding web development language, coding environment and documentation. my choice of curated collection of docs prevented friction and potential confusion if using real developer documents.  


In this design, participants aim for affordances as visible  points.

In the design above such  points include: regular play-testing; the use of documentation; and highlighted variables and level structure in the quick start stage.

To incorporate the utility of  previously used affordances within the community,  we can imagine a climbing rock-face metaphor of a lead climber leaving a trail for others behind. Or in a training environment of a climbing wall, attaching colours to a particular route designed to suit a particular skill level.

<!-- Similarly, as the process unfold the faciliator may see learners repeatedly run into the same obstacle and not be able to see the anchor points available to them. Perhaps even catching onto snags or other debris, false anchor points. -->


The role of the faciliator in this metaphor is to structure the climber journey to the top.

This my be done by
- defining or reducing the use use of specialised terminology  or
- hiding away un-needed complexity.
- signposting issues   
- imagining the lines of sight of the learner. try to remove large obstacles to potential anchour points.

### Exploring transformative agency using the metaphor of Kedging anchors


As outlined in chapter 3, Sannino explains TADS using a  metaphor of a using a kedging anchors.

The following section integrates affordance theory into a metaphor to encompass concerns of a more structured learning design.


#####  LINKING TO ANCHORS TO AFFORDENCES

Thus affordances in the learning design can be viewed in this frame as a catching point for these anchors [@hopwood_agency_2022]. An effective learning environment provides a sea bed with many rocks (affordances) for warping anchors (volitional acts of participant agency to transform learning) [@aagaard_teacher_2022].
TADS and the associated metaphor of warping anchors is normally applied in settings of group action.

To aid learners agency, designers notice existing paths of participants and add explicit anchor points and make them visible to learners. The process is on-going and mutual. Additionally, this work happens in an facilitated environment. Design decisions server to clarify common problems areas, thus making the water clearer to better see anchor points. The job of the designer is in part to identify the causes of turbulence and thus create support in a sheltered space of a harbour.


**An example of mini TADS - use of secondary resources**
 <!-- REFLECTION ON BRICOLAGE? -->
An illustrative design tension emerged surrounding which kind of documentation to prioritise. After initially steering participants directly to code snippets, I subsequently directed them instead to step by step tutorials which also included a link to the code snippets. I shifted between prioritising instruction-based practices and more piecemeal, bricolage inspired (see LR) developer practices. Whilst the process of instruction is problematic in terms of learner agency this vies with the practicality to establish a common understanding and shared framework for production.

a theme explored in more detail in chapter five
Traditional, printed, instruction-based software manuals are in decline partly due online documentation but also due to the increased intuitive nature of their design [@pogue_user_2017].
CH 5.

vThe careful alignment between navigational documentation and the participants driving objectives of the mid-level activity system of implementing a game element, also helped avoid mismatch between task and tools described above as mismatch between primary and secondary stimuli.
The process aligns with the concept of just-in-time instruction.
