<!-- I also discuss these findings in line with existing research in relevant areas. -->
## Introduction

The previous chapters have explored both designed and fortuitous changes to the learning design that become adopted by the community.

This chapter deepens analysis and discussion on RQ2 on the potential uses of GDPs and concludes with  analysis and discussion on RQ3 addressing reflections on partcipant agency.

Following Chapter 6's presentation findings on how participants use GDPs, this chapter contains further discussion on this use GDPs ,
particularly in reference to the building of agency.

To do this chapter continues to explore the context of the study's emergent cultural and community activity, deepens discussion on interpersonal activity and implications for dimensions of tool use on learner agency in a way which at times addresses wider aspects of the learning design than GDPs.

This chapter has three main sections:

1. Rising to concrete ; Conceptions of abstract and concrete present in computing and digital making research: ultimately, proposing design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework compared to computational thinking.

<!-- - propose that GDPs provide a suitable way to engage with coding practices partly due to their position between abstract computational concepts and concrete implementations of code structures. -->

3. Synthesis in relation to  Issues of inclusive pedagogy. UDL, UMC, MOE.  This  underline the entire motivation and design of the study. Returning therefore to a fundamental point of the study to explore how this help diverse learners in a challenging area to learn. Ending by suggesting UDL as a helpful framework,

- explore potential implications for facilitators and researchers on how to design for inclusion and agency - e.g. use of GDP collection as an  intermediate pedagogical construct.

The lens of inclusion and the alignment with UDL is relevant as a possible resolution to abstract  / concrete tensions as a gateway to access diverse learner pathways and thus avoid an overly complex navigational framework thus reducing cogintive load.

<!-- - MOVE TO CONCLUSION? metaphors / frameworks to envisage affordences and particpant agency in CHAT framework. and why this is useful for facilitators and as an accessibel way to share findings. -->




The chapter contains a discussion on wider concerns of designing for learner agency. Here I synthesise analysis on processes which support learners to develop agency in this game making community
(and the role of different levels of authenticity?)

This section takes a step back to explore the wider perspectives of the findings beyond the immediate context to digital making and project based approaches and understandings of design patterns in educational contexts.

**more intro material**

An underlying proposal of this thesis is the development of  learner agency can be facilitated by designing effective learning environments. To do this I draw on key forms of developmental agency explored in Chapter 3.

This section synthesises findings learner agency in relation to existing conceptions of agency in other research.

This section explores these academic conceptions in a playful way using relatable metaphors from related research. The aim of this playful/relatable approach is to aid the situation of later recommendations for researchers and educators working in this area in an accessible way.

## Part one - Exploring concepts of abstract and concrete knowledge frameworks in relation to Game Design Patterns


1. Recap, GDPs as a Germ cell, Exploring CHAT concepts of abstraction  
2. Locating TADS in this perspective, via 3GAT concept of expansion via double stimulation and TADS
3. Papert - pluralism & the concrete
4. then Waite Levels of abstraction - & observations
5. Then begin practical use of this take - tinkering pedagogy

In chapter two I described the characteristics and limits of computational thinking as a pedagogical framework, specifically concepts include: varied interpretations; the role of levels of abstraction for teachers and learners; and the value of epistemological pluralism as a way to value concrete approaches.

The previous chapter began to explore, through the lens of personal appropriation, to variety of abstract concepts and more concrete applications suitable for development via this learning design. This investigation has provoked careful reflection of abstract-concrete dimensions of emerging knowledge happening in the game making and digital making more generally.

There are two main aspects of this. Firstly, the research process and the evolving design involve a process of rising to the concrete, identifying an abstraction of interest and then different concrete instantiations of it. Secondly, the abstract concrete tension runs as a theme through the literature of this domain. This section addresses both aspects.

This section ends by unifying these threads with an proposal of GDPs as a mid-level construct, demonstrating their utility for both educational designers and researchers.


### Exploration of findings in relation to CHAT conceptions of abstraction

WHY IMPORTANT? LINK BACK HERE?

<!-- surfacing a distinction between curricular contents commonly associated with a more abstract understandings of personal knowledge, including more abstract elements of computation thinking.  -->

To start, let us consider the nature of the abstraction of gameplay design patterns via Sannino' [-@sannino_activity_2011] distinction between empirical and theoretical abstraction.

    "While observation and categorization are actions at the root of empirical abstraction, practical transformation, change, and experimentation are actions at the root of theoretical abstraction. Theoretical abstraction allows one to generate and project complex, theoretically mastered concrete manifestations and developmental forms of the reality under scrutiny. A theoretical abstraction is based on a functional relationship, also called a germ cell." [@sannino_activity_2011].

<!-- There are two types of abstractions: empirical and theoretical. Empirical abstraction
is a classification of superficial features of phenomena. Theoretical abstraction refers to the identification of the genetic origins of phenomena that may externally be not alike at all. A theoretical abstraction is based on a functional relationship, also called a germ cell.  While observation and categorization are actions at the root of empirical abstraction, practical transformation, change, and experimentation are actions at the root of theoretical abstraction. Theoretical abstraction allows one to generate and project complex, theoretically mastered concrete manifestations and developmental forms of the reality under scrutiny
Title: Activity theory as an activist and interventionist theory, Author: Sannino, Date: 10/2011 -->
<!-- A deeper exploration of other concepts may suit another chapter looking at synthesing observations in relation to broader research.  -->

In this research, the empirical level of abstraction is  present in P1 and in P2 where features to be added to the game were classified gameplay features and categorised according to to the existing MDA framework. Moving beyond the empirical towards the theoretical aspect, is the early positioning of each feature as a gameplay design pattern which can be described and supplemented with a suggested code structures and examples.
ANY OTHERS

The key, guiding conception here becomes the pedagogical utility of a strong coupled link between a feature of an observable game product (in this case gameplay design patterns) and scaffolding resources available within a community. This concept becomes the root of the varied approaches and forms of support outlined in this chapter. Some instances based on this kernel concept were created by myself in response to user requests in varied forms of support documentation outlined in Chapter 5 ( e.g. quick start card

 <!-- Design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework (compared to computational thinking) -->


The process of identifying and working with GDPs in this research process can be mapped as a dialectical process of moving (rising) to the concrete [@sannino_activity_2011]. It is this movement from a kernel idea into varied concrete instances that is the root of the power of the approach according to CHAT scholars.  While, the varied uses as meditational strategies and their integration into varied concrete forms of creative cultural and interpersonal repertoires many be particular to this setting, the germ cell concept described above is a theoretical and generalisable abstraction not particular to this context.


Rather than Germ Cell for learning designers the concept of strong concepts or intermediate concepts may be more relatable and applicable [@hook_strong_2012; @barendregt_intermediate-level_2018]

And invites this discussion to turn to the role of conceptions of abstract and concrete in the process of designing for learning, with a particular focus on the concern of this study of participant agency.

While the educational use of design patterns and has been explored in other settings via research, the focus has been on professional rather than novice learners.  




<!-- While understanding the process is more obviously useful for faciliators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects. -->




<!-- Through this lens the most abstract activity system is the larger one who's objective, to make an engaging game that tells an environmental story, aligns with the problem level of LOA. The level between abstract and concrete is that of choosing, implementing and testing game design patterns, which aligns with design. The most concrete in this interpretation is then the implementation of different lines of code or creation and migration of digital assets. -->


### Exploration of GDPs as mid-level construct in relation to other conceptions of abstraction in computing education research


#### Design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework - THE HYPOTHESIS

This direction of the findings of the last chapter, support findings on design patterns in other contexts as a middle ground between abstract CT concepts and more concrete techniques.

    In order to be useful, patterns must present an abstraction of good practice at a meaningful level of granularity. Formulations that are too abstract will be impractical in real design use; those that are too specific will be difficult to re-use in new scenarios.[@dearden_pattern_2006, p. 20]

A similar interpretation is adopted by a grouping of HCI researchers exploring the value of "intermediate-level concepts" [@barendregt_intermediate-level_2018; @hook_strong_2012], as a form of "representation of knowledge in-between general theories and particular artefacts in terms of abstraction and generalizability" [@eriksson_using_2019, p.15]. Höök and Löwgren [@hook_strong_2012] illustrate this _midway_ concepts as heuristics or design patterns between concrete instances of products and more general theories e.g. constructivism [@stolterman_concept-driven_2010].

The work of Eriksson et al. [-@eriksson_using_2019, p.15] using gameplay design patterns with young people draws inspiration from this research on value of design patterns.  

An alignment in this framing from the design research community with CHAT interpretation of the utility of a germ cell construct can be made in terms of the utility of the process and the process of divining a abstract enough germ cell to merit application in other instances.

However, given that the area of research in which this is carried out is CCI rather than that of learning computer programming or game making, it is value to examine types of abstract / concrete framework in this area.


Additionally, it is important to ask who these frameworks are aimed at.

#### Purpose of the frameworks being addressed is also relevant.

Before further analysis on semantic waves, and types of abstract / concrete framework

This is the motivational aspect of framework?

a. As a research framework - Eriksson et al.
b. A facilitator / design framework -
c. as a participant framework for navigation and goal formation as explored in the previous chapter.

Addressing the first aspect, the process of rising the concrete outlined above is helpful not just for analysis (a) but also for ongoing pedagogical design (b).

The third aspect c, can be returned to, but where and when in this chapter? Points follow:
- the link with the experienced feature of the game / product as a framework increases inclusive nature of process (later?)

PERHAPS MOVE THIS TO NEXT SECTION
What about semantic waves and movement. How explicit does the understanding of the motion between poles need to be? For example in my design, it is not very explicit of guided towards. However, this may be different in different UK computing settings.

This potential non-alignment with UK non-formal may be a limitation in the take up of this research.  



#### Types of abstraction in frameworks - recalling definitions or lack of clear definitions
**More concrete CT**
Q: What is abstraction and who useful for?

The term abstraction has varied interpretation even within the field of computer science education [@hazzan_reducing_2002].

It is of a value to return to, what exactly is meant by the abstract within existing pedagogies in this domain explore this area. To do this we can turn to concepts explored in Chapters 1 and 2: computational thinking, Papert and Turkle's concept of epistemological pluralism and bricolage approach and  the concept of levels of abstraction (LOA)  


##### Computational thinking

In this research, I conceptualised such less practical abstraction as that represented by Wing's interpretation of computational thinking. Which as explored in Chapter 2 is a more abstract definition can be see as overarching computing principles with cross over to high level structural design approaches.

<!-- To ground this in GCSE examples.

Iteration and Selection are in the gcse example, tick examples of them. Just recognise. -->

While Wing's emphasis on the importance of the explicit teaching of skills of decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking, contribution on computational thinking is  more theoretical than applied. Begs question how do you teach computation thinking in most abstract way via explicit teaching. Grover [@grover_computational_2017; @grover_computational_2013], Guzdial [@guzdial_learner-centered_2015]- offer explicit techniques linked with computer coding. Bell and colleagues [@bell2019constructing] explore the process of unplugged activities, exploring abstract CT concepts without using computers or coding.

This learning design takes a fundamentally different approach. Abstract aspects of CT are strongly scaffolded, i.e. the process of code decomposition via the pre-existing functions in the code template, and abstraction again in template via the graphical design tool. The process of abstraction is also present, indeed it is present in the the last section addressing the process of moving from concrete exploration to an abstract germ cell of GDP use. The subsequent structuring of the of core learning design around a collection of GDPs coupling description and implementation also involves the processes of decomposition and pattern recognition. Thus, while the process was collaborative in goal formation the heavy lifting was carried out by myself, a decision justified by focusing on more relational elements of the learning design aligned with the RQ3. In this context, Wing's CT framework describes some of the processes I have undertaken as a learning designer and researcher, but is less relevant to participants.


**More concrete CT**: As explored in the appendix on learning map, the more concrete elements of CT definition [@brennan_new_2012], which exist on a more applied level, are readily observed in the data as explored in the following section.


<!-- What has this research got to say about the relationship between the two? -->
<!-- **In terms of recommendations for researchers / practitioners of an intermediate framework:** -->
<!-- As such this research has only more theoretical propositions rather than participant data. -->

##### Levels of Abstraction

While Waite and colleagues also propose that abstraction should be explicitly taught, even to younger pupils [@waite_abstraction_2016], their approach to abstraction [@waite_abstraction_2018-1] is distinct from that just tackled in that it is grounded in an operationalised  computational model distinguishing levels of abstract to concrete, specifically, in descending order of abstraction,
the goal or problem to be solved, the designed structure of the program, the actual coding of that design and at the most concrete level the running of the code and its outputs [@waite_abstraction_2018-1]. Wing's CT concepts within the LOA model would lie in the design level.


Their advocacy for the utility of awareness of levels of abstraction, based on research indicating its efficacy to support learning programming [@cutts2012abstraction; @statter_teaching_2016], states the value of learners knowing at what level of abstraction they are operating and a fluency of movement between the levels. Waite and Sentence's later work synthesised this approach with interpretation of levels of abstraction and semantic waves in a computing education aligned with a UK curricular context  [@sentance_primm_2017]. The focus of semantic waves aimed at teachers to help them design learning experiences which allow for participant shifts in LOA perspectives.
<!-- This context frames the following contribution to the debate in this area. -->


Following Waite et al. interpretation, in the Use stage of the UMC model [@lee_computational_2011] (explored in Chapter 5 in relation to this research's learning design), participants would be aware of the goal of the program, and the results. Subsequently, in the Modify stage they would become familiar with the design and code levels. Further analysis of my learning design in relation to the concept of LOA follows, after an exploration of abstract and concrete learning approaches in the work of Papert and colleagues in the following section.


Turning  to a synthesis of my finding with those of Waite et al on levels of abstraction, while the teaching of the theories levels of abstraction is not explicit, movement is clearly happening, as demonstrated by the table below.


| **Level**            | **Focus** | **Example** |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Conceptual Level**  | Thinking about the GDPs to be added to the game | Goal formation, prioritisation |
| **Design Level**  | GDP supporting documentation scaffolds this process  | What it should do is to a large extent preset via documentation. |
| **Code Level**  | Writing the actual code, is supported via code patching  | is supported via code patching, and a structure which encourages modification |
| **Execution Level**  | Understanding the outputs | A strong correlation between goal and outcome, as playing the game product is very immediate. |

Table. 2.x Breakdown or Table of levels of abstraction. [@waite_abstraction_2018]


With this focus, we can analyse my learning design where movement between layers of abstraction and concrete is happening.

However, this is not a neat semantic sine wave.
Specifically the flexible nature of the design practices shows shifting rapidly and sometimes chaotically.


<!-- THIS DEPENDS ON WHAT THE CONCEPTION OF ABSTRACTION IS HERE -->

##### Epistemological pluralism, bricolage & Microworlds

In Chapter 2 the concepts and legacy of Papert and Turkle's [-@papert_epistemological_1990] exploration of diversity in coding approaches which the call epistemological pluralism. The focus here is on their championing of approaches beyond the dominant formal/ abstract approach that "emphasizes control and through structure and planning" [@papert_epistemological_1990, p.134]. This approach which can be characterised by the following: a top-down design processing involving extensively planning prior to coding, explicit teaching of language principles and syntax, coding from scratch rather than altering existing products. To counter this dominance, Papert and Turkle [-@papert_epistemological_1990] highlighted the value of a more concrete computing pedagogy, likening the process to bricolage, a craft based approach where participants become very familiar with their tools and materials. The authors exploration of the types of coders as either Planners or Bricoleurs aligns with two aspects of the making styles explored briefly in Chapter 5. Bricoleur types are describes as preferring to stay in closer contact with the a concrete sense of the outcomes even to the expense of programming efficiency of neatness of code.

This recognition and advocacy for the bricolage approach, seemingly also also challenge Waite's research on the importance of alternating between abstract and concrete dimensions present in research on semantic waves, and the value of participants being aware of the level of abstraction at which they are working.

My research is relevant here in that my observations show many of my participants operating as bricoleurs, feeling their way through their game making via smaller scale iteration (a process encouraged by the learning design). My findings show that, the shifts in LOA Waite advocate are present in this bricolage process. Shifts between conceptions of goals, implementation in code structures, and observations of results are happening.

What is different is from a Papert, and perhaps Wing's concept of a top down planner, is the level of abstraction present at the design level of the LOA framework. Bricoleurs avoid structures which take them away from the concrete via abstraction processes.

Papert's focus on Microworlds using the LOGO language as a vehicle to make concrete previously abstract mathematical concepts, seems to locate the exploration of abstract knowledge as a learning goal. My design process aligns with the rational of Microworld design, in that I have already undertaken some of that abstraction or blackboxing in the starting template.

THIS NEEDS WORK - MORE ON MY EXAMPLES - CHECK BELOW TO MOVE UP?

A careful examination of the literature is needed here to catch the complexities present. The celebration here is of pluralism rather than the culturally prevalent one privileging abstraction. Abstraction is not seen as undesirable.

This, can be perhaps profitably explored using the concept of leading activity, which in this case is play rather than instruction, and is led by the child rather than the teacher.



<!-- Their celebration of concrete coding approaches, including the use of tangible physical and digital objects, and more piecemeal, bricolage approach has influenced the design of popular educational programming software and pedagogy through the constructionist school and maker movements (as explored in the literature review). -->

<!--

move to lit review?
However, Wilensky [-@wilensky1991abstract] questions the nature of abstract in this context arguing that all objects and concepts are abstract until familiarity makes them more concrete to the user. -->


<!-- #### In SUMMARY

Thus in summary conceptions of abstraction above explored above include:

- Wing's take on computational thinking: abstraction, decomposition, generalisation / pattern recognition, implementation via an algorithmic process.
- A more holistic practice-based definition from Resnick, Brennan -
- Waite's LOA - abstract here drawing on levels within the problem or product  - navigation between levels, explicit teaching of such navigation. -->

### Observations on abstract / concrete dimensions in my data related to gameplay design patterns.

1. positioning as intermediate
2.  looking at distinction in different studies in context



I now returning to the proposal of GDPs as a useful intermediate level framework, given the framing of abstract in summary above, and explore this proposal using the findings of my research process.  

**positioning as intermediate**

Let us first re-examine the utility of term intermediate framework [@eriksson_using_2019]. Does the framework provided by GDPs sit between a more abstract theory and concrete implementation given? Waite's conception of LOA would place the implementation of each GDP at the highest level of abstraction. Whereas the more potentially transferable concepts of Wing's take of CT would form a candidate for a higher generalisable theory which GDPs sit between that and concrete implementation. In the research of Eriksson et al (and the others) on GDPs [-@eriksson_using_2019], the positioning as GDPs as an intermediate construct compared, the nature of the general theories are not clearly articulated. At this stage it is of value to looking past a potentially arbitrary placing of these levels of a hierarchy, to investigate instead the core value of the intermediate nature of the framework in the context of my research.  

<!-- To explore the findings of last chapter in relation to this exploration of the nature and purpose of abstraction in guiding frameworks in learning programming, I return to research on the use of gameplay design patterns. -->

ANYTHING HERE ON REPENNING?


<!-- Thus the general theories may relate to the researchers field in practice, that of Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) [@lehnert_childcomputer_2022], as the theories of this domain  would be less accessible to children than their framework of a carefully chosen collection of GDPs. -->

**The nature of intermediacy in the work of Eriksson et al and my own to framing analysis**


One of the more developed work in GDP as such a framework is in Eriksson et al. The context of their GDP study is distinct in that whereas the young people in the Stringforce study are making design suggestions to alter a game they are not making their own games by modifying computer code.

This distinction is important as it drove a modification of their use of design patterns. Instead of a strongly coupled link between motivation, description and implementation articulated as a problem-solution structure which is present in convention conceptions of design patterns to focus only on descriptions of patterns rather than any detail of solution. In my design by contrast there is strong coupling between the role, description and implementation as illustrated by the structure of the supporting resources outlined in Chapter 5.

This coupling bear examination in relation to the positioning of GDPs as a leading activity, as illustrated by my decision to treating the implementation of each GDPs as an activity system in itself. For participants, the framework of GDPs facilitates goal formation. Once engaged with this goal, participant can use the affordances of the design to traverse different LOA as articulated by Waite.

**Turning to the utility**

Eriksson et al. note the utility of GDP concepts in several dimensions: as a lingua franca between researchers and participants; to help framing of analysis; and to help the inspiration of participants. ADD MORE. It should be noted that the greater part of this analysis focuses the utility for on the researcher rather than that of participants.

Thus following section develops this line of research, making more explicit the observed and potential uses of GDPS in participant game making by participants, facilitators/teachers and researchers.


#### Addressing utility for participants

Recapping previous examples in vignettes. etc.  

In computing eduction pattern based instruction has benefits of making complex problems more modular and concrete [@muller_almost_2004-1; @waite_teaching_2021].

In terms of participant experiences, it is clear from this chapters findings that learners _are_ shifting between LOA without explicit in the process of the use of and contribution to this learning design.

The last chapter outlined the potential of GDP concepts, especially used within playtesting, to support these participant shifts in perspective.

Of particular relevance regarding the utility for learners in this domain of abstract/concrete domain would be in

   1. Goal formation - in ideation, prioritisation.
   2. Navigation, structuring of resources and docs - and in a holistic sense  
   3. Division of Labour - at times the more abstract processes are left to the more competent partner

Participant perspectives shift between the wider goal of making an engaging game for a real and imagined audience to a narrower goal of implementing a game design pattern and the technical actions and operations needed to complete it.

Reflections in progression of design in P4 showed my reluctance to lead with or explicitly teach abstract concepts with CT. Further discussion on the dilemma of how explicit teaching of computational concepts should be in taken up in the following section addressing the perspective for designers / teachers.


#### Addressing utility for designers / teachers

It follows that the concerns above are also relevant for designers who want to design for these aspects, and for facilitators and teachers in these fields.

Turning to alignment with PBL research in (but perhaps not limited to) digital making, a key challenge to project based learning is finding appropriate conceptual and practical frameworks to scaffold domain specific working practices to ameliorate the dialectical tension between engagement via tinkering and requirements to promote "principled understanding" [@barron_doing_1998, p.63].

My reflections /data support a proposition that there is utility for **facilitators** to be aware of the level of abstraction both that present in different elements of project learning design and that of the concepts that learners are working with.

As a challenge to Waite's initial statement on the value of explicitly teaching abstraction, my own notes and reflections (see appendix.learning in particular) map cautioned me against explicit teaching of abstraction and imposing shifts in perspectives for fear of interrupting the flow of participant making. In this context I judged the imposition of an additional goal of understanding abstract curricular concepts as potentially counter productive to the overall aim of acculturation to game making tools and processes and developing an inclusive idioculture.

The close coupling between design and code structure levels in my design may not align with LOA principles given that "1:1 mapping between the design/algorithm and the code may lead to confusion between the levels" [@waite_abstraction_2018-1, p.21]. However, given that Waite's subsequent research does not include examples of activity explicitly teaching abstraction [@waite_abstraction_2018-1; @sentance_teachers_2019; @sentance_teaching_2019], what counts as explicit teaching of abstraction is not clear.


This question returns us to issues of how much such abstraction and other elements of abstract CT are concepts that need to be explicitly taught or something which is picked up an embedded skill through a more bricolage approach.

As explored in Chapter 2 the literature review paints a very mixed picture in this regard and while it is problematised in relation to agency development later, this research doesn't negate the value of explicit teaching of computational thinking,

However this research contends that GDPs are a more suitable accessible  framework than that of computational thinking when making games and as such should be the leading  and guiding pedagogical framework. If a knowledge of CT is needed by the learning context then it could be profitably explored in other ways. For example, developing resources suitable for such reflection,  for instance a learning map to be used by participants and teachers as explred in P4 . Linking from docs to descriptions of the characteristics. Thus not a leading pedagogical framework but a map of possible skills and concepts made possible by the leading activity.





<!-- Route-based activities with a 1:1 mapping between the design/algorithm and the code may lead to confusion between the levels. -->
<!-- I had a reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge. My concern also reflected potential disorientation and reduced experiences of agency from imposed shifts of focus rather than self-initiated ones. I also propose that to further research to would be needed to justify the utility take the time to interrupt flow to explicitly teach abstraction, and abstract CT concepts, apart from if understanding of such concepts are required by curriculum constraints. -->


<!-- BUT WHAT ABOUT LEARNERS? HERE THE PERSPECTIVE IS BLURRED IF TEACHERS ARE STEERING TOWARDS A CURRICULUM. -->

<!-- As synthesis, in terms of semantic waves, the movement between abstract and concrete is helpful to address some of the issues concerning inclusion and accessibility of overly abstract approaches [@papert_epistemological_1990].
 -->


### How my research contributes in this area - particularly in the conception of different pedagogies.



<!-- #### Quick Re-framing of My pedagogical approach in a/c dimension

We now return to the question.

Q: What is abstraction and who useful for?

A: In this study. GDPs are useful as a inclusive, intermediate framework, with alignment between experience and abstractions of product.   -->


#### Comparing my pedagogical framing regarding dimensions of abstract/ concrete with existing research

The evidence and examples surfaced in this paragraph support a view of a collection of GDPs, as an productive research and pedagogical framework. The data of the last chapter contributes a series of grounded pedagogical instances via examples which map a concrete pedagogical process to  theoretical observations.

As concept was originally framed in terms of it's utility for researchers in HCI, the refaming of the last section to explore its utility from the perspective of learners and teachers also requires a change in terminology. Instead of an _intermediate framework_, I propose the term _gateway framework_ to avoid the confusion explored earlier in terms of position within a hierarchy.

Within this line of inquiry concerning navigation of different levels of abstraction within this process, the characteristics of such a framework would be that it:

- guides learners to use GDPs as their primary leading activity, or object in CHAT terms
- provide a documentation supporting structure aligned to these sub-goals
- is strongly coupled with object output, ideally via rapid responses

This gateway framework driven by strong coupling between levels of abstraction, may also facilitate reflection structured using the learning map. This was an area of development in P4, with a diagram expressed which drew on the concept of semantic waves DROP OR REVISE?. This is an strong candidate for further research.

PERHAPS BRING UP UP TO DATE ISSUE OF TRANSFER. - BUT PERHAPS LEAVE FOR CONCLUSION. NOTE ALSO THE BALANCE BETWEEN CT CONCRETE SKILLS AND TRANSFER IN [@kynigos_modifying_2020]


<!-- However this does not detract from the value of learners navigating different LOA in following their interests.
Leading with GDPs as a framework appears to support this  navigation, and at times in this research it is undertaken fluently and joyfully. -->






<!-- While I address areas for future research in the conclusion, a proposed benefit of this research is While understanding the process is more obviously useful for facilitators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects. To underscore the potential and to uncover a starting point for pedagogies that can be transferred to diverse design projects. -->


### Link to next section and signposting final discussion section


<!-- How then does this impact on conceptions of valuable pedagogies to help the development of coding fluency (NOTE THIS IS NOW MISSING FROM THE RQs) -->


In the previous analysis of the use of GDPs through the lens of research on the aspect and concrete dimensions in computing education, there is an alignment with the personal dimension of knowledge highlighted in the previous chapter. As noted in Chapter 2, much research on the learning to coding has focused chiefly on this aspect of personal knowledge construction,  neglected this social and perspectives typified by socio-cultural approaches [find source]. This trend is exemplified by a comparison of Wing and Papert's conceptions of computational thinking [@lodi_computational_2021], with the latter's additional focus on the community application of created projects forms the motivational basis of much of constructionism in the process of creating objects to share. Thus, the issue at hand transcends concepts of efficacy of how to support the coding process to address the underlying goals of the activity. Following the legacy of constructionism to the present day, the articulation of Resnick of computational fluency, addresses the limitations of research focusing too narrowly on technical approaches rather than their expressive potential (and thus withing a community) [@resnick_coding_2020] and focused on toolsets rather than pedagogies [@resnick_seeds_2020]. We should recall here the parallel call of Kafai and Burke in the field of game making for learning to address social and cultural motivations and aspects of the process [@kafai_constructionist_2015-1].


In a UK computing education context, while the work of Waite and Sentence begins to address sociocultural aspects [@sentance_teaching_2019; @hwang_using_2023], this work is limited in scope and merits further attention. The following section addresses discussion on the social and cultural aspects of this study using the development of varied forms of participant agency as an analytical lens.

<!-- The final section of this chapter returns to a guiding question of pedagogies that can support the development of computational fluency and within that participant agency. -->

## Part Two - Agency


### 2.a Affordances, Mediation, TADS,

1. recap on germ cell as common focus point for mediation (some designed or apporpirated)
2. When novel forms of mediation present, gdps sometimes used - thus as double stimulation
3. This is a transformation / expansion in 3GAT terms, recap as a resolution of tensions, and a manifestation of agency
4. Give a summary of examples of transformational agency
5. Briefly touch on the job of the learning designer within concept of F.I
6. The dilemma here of transformational happening most for participants in P1, and you can design OUT transformational agency, hence sketchy pedagogies.

<!-- 5. DROP /MOVE TO CH.3? The kedging metaphor and the climbing wall metaphor - in relation to agency and design -  explore them, kedging is a bit flailing , wall less so -->



A guiding principle of this section is that given the motivation (either primary or secondary) of participant empowerment in learning to program, and thus the value of designing and facilitating participant agency in the ongoing process, that it is profitable to articulate different types of agency.

This section analyses the findings of the previous chapters using varied conceptions of agency aligned to the sociocultural theoretical framework of this study.



<!-- Chapter 5  exposed the tensions that developed in the activity systems and subsequent evolution the tools used include code authoring environment, supporting resources of printed and digital format. -->

<!-- ### Justifying the use of Metaphors in these FINDINGS - CONCLUSION?

A mixed readership for this research is hoped for as relevant to pracitioners and some of the break down of agency is quite academic in tone and potentialy opaque.

There is a good tradition of metaphors in this space with Papert's low thresholds, high ceilings and wide walls concept. INSERT IN LR, PERHAPS IN TRANSITION FROM MICROWORLDS TO SCRATCH AND DESIGN BUILD TEST GAME MAKING.

<!-- REMOVE THIS DUPLICATE EXAMPLE .
For example in my design:
Introducing additional tools in the form of documentation to the initial coding environment and template provided in early stages introduced tensions between the opportunities for independent development and the additional complexity of the process. -->


### Instrumental Agency


As previously explored, varied conceptions of agency exist including: instrumental, authorial and transformative agency [@matusov_mapping_2016]. (See methodology chapter).

To summarise similarities and distinctions between mediation and a transformative approach  [@isaac_cultural_2022], it is beyond an instrumental approach to provoke change in the environment.

The exploration of tensions in Chapter 5 summary, design decisions of tool use can to increase agency in practical terms by providing affordances or by removing barriers to use. Conceptually these practical dimension can be framed as instrumental agency or removing aspects of negative liberty caused by technical barriers [@matusov_mapping_2016, p. 433].

Examples of mediation and instrumental agency are shown in varied forms in the use of GDPs aligned often with a personal appropriation (shown in Table 6.1).

As an example take the resolution of tensions surrounding  authenticity of coding web development language, coding environment and documentation. my choice of curated collection of docs prevented friction and potential confusion if using real developer documents.  

Straight forward individual use of documentation by Tony and Susanna in V1 and V2.

**Affordances as points on a climbing wall to support understandings of instrumental agency - MOVE**

<!-- In the original metaphor the casting of the anchor is random, experimental. It is unsure if the anchor will catch on anything under the surface. However,  -->


In this design, at participants aim for affordances allowing a mediation process as visible points.
A suitable metaphor may be a climbing wall use for rock-climbing training.
The job of a facilitator may be to highlight certain affordances, attaching colours to a particular route designed to suit a particular skill level.
For example the bringing to the top of variable to impact game play in the quick start activities.

### Transformational Agency

TA can be viewed in different ways, in this design I take a conservative view of TA, as something new to the learning design, not just new to the learner.

<!-- This is explored later, next section on relational agency.   -->

In relation to this design the greatest period of transformation was in P1. The emergence of GDPs as a guiding activity and pedagogical framework can be seen to emerged from expressions of transformational agency from participants and myself as a designer at this times.

<!-- In P1, (see Chapter 5 (check)) the initial use of GDPs as a planning tool, and as a vehicle for prototypical documentation. -->

Beyond P1, there are still spaces for TA once the core pedagogy is in place.
For examples,
In Vig. Tody and Dan the break out of the template to create a different genre.

**Exploring transformative agency using the metaphor of Kedging anchors**

As outlined in chapter 3, Sannino explains TADS using a  metaphor of a using a kedging anchors.

The following section integrates affordance theory into a metaphor to encompass concerns of a more structured learning design.

In this metaphor the act of casting out the anchor is a visible act of volition which aims overcome conflicts blocking activity progress. Thus affordances in the learning design can be viewed in this frame as a catching point for these anchors [@hopwood_agency_2022].

The process may serve to surface perviously unknown forms of mediation and use of tools not only for those undertaking this volitional activity but also others in the learning community.

To aid learners evolving activity, as a designer I noticed these attempts and then tried to add explicit anchor points and make them visible to learners. The process is on-going and mutual. Additionally, this work happens in an facilitated environment. Design decisions server to clarify common problems areas, thus making the water clearer to better see anchor points.

This interpretation highlights possible shifts in forms of agency and an emerging dilemma in the evolving learning design.


### Shifting forms of agency

**Shifting forms of agency.**
How different forms of  agency are developed and transform over iterations of this game making programme  

Initial blocks are solved by heroic transformative agency of parents, children and facilitator.

Then patterns and tools become established in the community, and agency shifts to be less authorial and more instrumental and relational.

**Designing for increased instrumental agency and then for TA?**

Integrate research on engendering authorial and transformative agency [@engestrom2006development; @haapasaari_emergence_2016; @sannino_formative_2016].



#### Dilemma / Tension for the facilitator, how sketchy to make the design? PERHAPS MOVE TO END TO ALLOW CF WITH RELATIONAL AGENCY?

The dilemma here of transformational happening most for participants in P1, and you can design OUT transformational agency, hence sketchy pedagogies


1. Shifting forms of agency
2. Danger of the design being too complete, a concept of sketchy pedagogy

From TA in P1
To relational in P2
Increased support for relational in P3


**Danger of designing away the possibility for transformational agency**

One of my drivers in this research was to better understand my love of sketch, chaotic learning environments.

The contrast of mediational based, instrumental agency of a more completed learning design and the more exploratory, experimental process of P1.

<!-- Adopting analysis which aligns authorial agency and transformative agency,  -->

There is a potential tension between instrumental agency and transformative agency. A design which minimises possible conflicts also reduces the potential for participants to solve them both individually and collective responses.


As a learning designer, design decisions to reduce practical tensions, increase the instrumental agency of learners allowing them to experience a feeling of control over their creative process.

Later participants have less opportunity for transformative agency in terms of how their input transforms the context and structure of the learning design.  

This invites a question: is nurturing transformative agency by creating space for emergent practices sustainable or desirable for ongoing iterations?

To retain this potential for transformation
it may be advantageous to keep some key areas of the learning design should be more open in structure to encourage the emergence of participant responses and novel practices.

How much of the learning design can/should be transferred to other settings.

In terms of desirability, as a personal refection while I love this aspect, but others can find it stressful. Different strokes.



<!--
NEEDED: MORE SYNTHESIS / DISCUSSION ON Instrumental agency, TRANFORMATIONAL AGENCY AND AUTHORIAL AGENCY IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS WORK ON METHODOLOGY. -->


And the danger of being too instrumental if the design is too complete.

A danger that my interest and focus on messy / sketchy pedagogies would try to avoid. But which has wider implications in terms of inclusion and levels of stress for participants.




<!-- The job of the designer is in part to identify the causes of turbulence and thus create support in a sheltered space of a harbour. -->

<!-- Thus affordances in the learning design can be viewed in this frame as a catching point for these anchors [@hopwood_agency_2022].

An effective learning environment provides a sea bed with many rocks (affordances) for warping anchors (volitional acts of participant agency to transform learning) [@aagaard_teacher_2022].
TADS and the associated metaphor of warping anchors is normally applied in settings of group action.
 -->



### 2c - Relational Agency in emergent activities in emergent cultural context - 3rd Spaces, idiocultures, and repertoires


<!-- In the last section using TADS and mediation helps analyse findings in personal (and guided participation) aspects of Chapter 6.  -->

This section moves beyond instrumental and transformative agency to a wider more ecological interpretation of agency helpful in deeper analysis of the cultural plane of activity.

<!-- POSSIBLY?
This helps inform a distinction between FI and SDE,
Whereas FI do x, SDE do y? <- too much.. -->

In research which addresses participant agency, Gutiérrez et al. [@gutierrez_youth_2019-1] incorporate broader cultural factors including issues of participant identity and movement of practices between learning settings. While these concepts build on the foundation of 3GAT in terms of conceptions of interacting activity systems [@engestrom_development_1996], they include concepts distinct from those explored in the Helsinki schools form of formative intervention Change Labs. This section explores the findings of previous chapters using three of these concepts of that or third spaces, idiocultures and repertoires of practice. Specifically positioning the idioculture of the game making program as a sum of emerging repertoires of practice of participants and practitioners happening in a third space.

This section contends that relational agency is the closest fit to match the development of these three elements but will complexify this via comparative analysis with transformational agency in the final section.


<!-- While this framings includes concepts already explored in sociocultural field including CoP, CoL,  -->

<!-- 1. Intro  Gutierrez - 3rd space and Fok + examples in this research, this view of agency has a greater focus on participant identity - and relational agency [@digiacomo_relational_2016-1]

3. Harbour, walled garden, restrictions  and authenticity in tool use

4. Examples in relation to the role of playtesting / playground to develop identity in a safe space, reduced stress, but with an important aspect of social interaction and norming -->

####  Observations on repertoires

**More on Funds of Knowledge / repertoires and how they emerge in my research**

One of they key findings of the previous chapter is the diverse use of GDP concepts within processes which allowed participant to incorporate practices and interests from home life or other spaces. Most notably this is seen within the sections on divisions of labour and use of funds of knowledge and identity. Examples include: being the identification with graphical art and the development of specialism in Madiha's family, the general use of game playing knowledge, home pedagogies like paper based sketching and more professional knowledge brought by Dan. This blending of the use of GDP concepts, in-template affordence, supporting resources, with such knowledge and practices from other activity systems can be analysed using the concept of repertoires. Rogoff and Gutierrez's initial motivation in their exploration of repertoires was to challenge simplistic, overgeneralising approaches regarding learning styles especially if applied to non-dominant communities [@gutierrez_cultural_2003]. The researchers highlight the value of identifying potential funds of knowledge framed as "linguistic and cultural-historical repertoires" that learners bring to learning environments [@gutierrez_cultural_2003, p.22]. Other research by Gutierrez addresses the importance of participants movement between sites of activity and its impact on learning [@gutierrez_developing_2008; @gutierrez_learning_2019-1].


##### Linking repertoires to my study / learning design & designing for agency

The data of this study provides a strong case study, evidence and detail to this process in the use of external repertoires and their remediation into new repertoires.

The process of developing new repertoires is not a solo process in this new space. The complex relations between participants outlined in the vignettes and data of the last chapter show an interdependence showing characteristics of relational agency.

Edwards  [@edwards2009systemic] explores relational agency within a CHAT framework as transcending individuals capacity to encompass collective problems solving via specialisation and diversity of approaches within activity systems. As a collective participants can overcome systemic contradictions via expansive learning, rearranging working relationships and thus opening new forms of relational agency. This concept is illustrated by the importance of feedback in community making and tinkering activities leading to increased "relational expertise" in partipants [@digiacomo_relational_2016-1 , p.144],

<!-- In the context of my study the role of forllowing design features of the learning environment bear greater exploration.

- the use of GDPs in the development of new  repertoires?
- the role playtesting in development of relational agency  
- analysis of additional activities helping the development of learner identities -->


While the data in the last chapter address aspects / elements of repertoires which incorporated GDPs, this chapter widens the focus of data examined to include other element of practices which help participants incorporated home repertoires as an inclusive practice.


#### Exploring design features which support identity development in the emerging game making community

The relationship between developing effective repertoires and the affective relationship to the activity relies on the participants being able to identify with the ongoing activity   thus informing a processes of inclusion.



The concept of hybridity as a way of recognising and deploying diversity of medational tactics and resources in learning contexts [@gutierrez_rethinking_1999] is relevant to this research as a pathway into an exploration of the competing alternate goals within the overall motivation of making a game to share, and component goals of implementing GDPs to do this.  

In a similar vein, drawing on Barron's helping roles [@barron_parents_2009], Roque [@roque_family_2016; @roque_im_2016] employed supporting faciliators to highlight and celebrate the helping processes parents used to support children in a making environment.

The examples of the previous chapter, particularly in the cultural plane show the value and means of developing participant identities.

and extends the research in the area of non-formal exploration of tech by providing a guiding framework using design patterns.

Example of alignment.

Example of how extending with DPs as a framework could be fruitful, developing and synthesising last chapter arguments.


In this design, as outlined in Chapter 5 and Appendix.drama I used a drama narrative, with side missions and the concept of player types to do this.




<!-- By the time phase three and video capture of data was underway, the process of playtesting began to take on interesting characteristics for some younger participants who were working more independently. -->
<!-- Because these interactions were mobile between works is it hard to transcribe interactions. However, description of the physical movement and gestures of the young people is relevant to explore the value of this behaviour which I will call playful playtesting.  -->

 <!-- Examples include.... -->


##### Use of GDPs in supporting social and cultural repertoires of practice  

The examples of cultural uses of GDPs in the last chapter included for use in helping design for others, as a way of incoporating home funds of knowledge and to encourage the propagation of existing and emerging design elements and practices through the community.

GDPs are used both as a useful tactic of navigation and as a bridging strategy to wider repertoires, then this can inform process of supporting the development participants to assemble their own repertoires of practice in this new setting.

The nature and process of this community evolution merits exploration. As such, this section steps back to discuss the emergence of these practices.  

I observed an evolution of the form and function of playtesting by young participants as an expression of agency by participants. The link to maker types here exists especially in social makers, glitchers and magpies.

My contribution is that using GDPs as a framework helps this process.


##### Playtesting as a suitable medium for emerging activities creating third spaces


Playtesting as an incubator for emerging cultural activities, has been crucial to the development of later stages of this learning design. The sum of introdued and emerging elements of repertoires can be framed as constituting the development of a particular game making idioculture.

As explored in the literature review, playtesting is a process common to game making which corresponds to the evaluation phase of design thinking cycles and the process of user testing in HCI [@fullerton_game_2018].

The role of play as leading activity is explored by Gutierrez [@gutierrez_learning_2019-1] to facilitate movement between sites of learning

An analysis on the role of playtesting and an emerging forms of playful playtesting follows.

<!-- In this section, I recall data to describe some of the emerging playtesting behaviours of participants in relation to the introduced learning design. -->

**Variations in approaches to playtesting**


Some participants refrained from extensive testing of other games, waiting for others to test their games and observing their responses. Others were very social in their playtesting approach. Madiha making very positive comments on design of player characters and building relations in that way. The last chapter showed that some participants used playtesting as a way to gain idea of what to add to their game next and to ask for direct help in that process.  

Some children added additional playful elements to playtesting (see Appendix.playtestingtypes).  Playtesting surfaced design practices which involved a playing against game design norms of the genre.

Some in particular brought a physicality to the process, clustring in a particular zone of the class, referencing the game play elements, acting them out, attempting to change the games of others and playful tussleing as part of resistance to those changes.

Playtesting acted as a stimulus and incubator for emerging socio-cultural practices promting me to ask if suitable affordances be added to the design to encourage their further growth in line with Gutiérrez's valuing of the inclusive, diverse properties of hybridity in practices [@gutierrez_rethinking_1999].


##### The introduction of maker types and side missions as affordences of my pedagogy to legitimise diversity

Such diversity in playtesting behaviours drove my reflection on the additional motivations bleeding into this system from other activity systems. Rather than refocusing participants back to more coding-focused activities, I coded playtesting and game making approaches in to a loose typology (see Appendix .makertypes for fuller detail).   

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game   
- **Planners:** like to study to build knowledge of the tools before they build up their game step-by-step following instructions
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users.

While not a conscious link, there is a parallel to the constrast between planners and bricoleurs present in this typology. By way of contrast the wider focus playtesting as well as coding behaviours.

Some approached objectives in a methodical manner, others socially and others embracing a playfully disruptive stance. Some decided to focus extensively on the creation and implementation of graphical assets and level design.

This process extends the work of Barron and Roque [@roque_family_2016; @roque_im_2016] to begin to surface and celebrage stylistic elements for all participants not just parents.

The process contextualises and legitmises the previously peripheral activities with the groups conceptions of the idioculture of the wider activity. This recognition of the hybridity of possible modes of paticipation increases conceptions of enacted diversity of the community. This strand of thought also invites a deeper theoretical examination of the value of identify formation.

#### Examining complexity within identity formation and specialisation

Within more narrowly defined game making activities centred around altering code and assets of their products, learners who had mastered certain specialist skills were asked by others for help. Their developing roles as domain experts provided additional affordances in the learning community and building an identify as specialist within it.


The introduction of these terms and missions
Stone and colleagues [@stone_problem_2007-2] underline the importance of "opportunities to transform learner identities needed for zones of competency" as something that can and should be designed into inclusive learning environments (focusing on goal development). The work of 5D research in different settings further explores the process of supporting learner identies in context []  Gutierrez, Cole

Or, perhaps more accurately here as a movement between activity systems, to be incorporated as a repertoire.

These repertoires become public, and are in part socially motivated, via the process of playtesting.

The process of feedback, recognising and valuing the merging areas of specialistation and expertise helps the dvelopment of diverse practices [@digiacomo_relational_2016-1]. The specialisation contributes to possibilities of relational agency for the learning environment as a whole. It exists as a form of identity within an individuals repertoire and for others to draw on as an affordence of the learning system.

The awareness of and conversations about maker styles and related side-missions created in this reseach are potential powerful tool to support this process in novice game making communities.


<!-- Hence the next section. An attempt a synthesis of diverse pedagogical elements  - DOES IT? -->

**LINK - NATURE OF TRANSFORMATION / LINK TO AGENCY**

It is of value to examine specialisation as a form of agency and identity formation using different lenses.

It can be seen through the lens of double stimulation. The choice to specialise, marks a form of transformative agency. Participants craft for themselves a specialist status which becomes shared and celebrated by the group.


Thus transformation is happening here but not in a revolutionary way. It is more of a blend of practices. In my data this happens in vignette data we can see elements of personal interest of young people, of home education collaborative work patterns, and of practices introduced by the facilitator from professional and educational contexts.  



<!-- **beyond primary and secondary tools / stimulation conception**

For this study, one issue of Sannino and Engestroms general approach is that there are many possible stimuli in a modern environment (find source ), and while yes, participant may adapt them for their own use, the focus on just one is potentially limiting. JUST A THOUGHT. -->

TO INTEGRATE?

The role of the emerging culture and identity of the idioculture  is developed in this chapter in the following ways:

- the impact / if any of the social missions and player types to help the development of learner identities.

- the emergence and nurturing of flexible and complex design behaviours (beyond player types)


**Gaps in exising research.**
The work of Resnick is convincing but lacks theoretical foundations as Papert's ideas were before their time. It is of value to align them with more contemporary socio-cultural conceptions.



### Synthesis - A complex view of agency and repertoires development within Idiocultures / 3rd spaces - PARK FROM A BIT AND COME BACK TO THIS.

COME BACK TO MY MOTIVATION OF THE STUDY HERE TOO.

While development of relational agency is a part of the social and cultural aspects of repertoires development, this section moves beyond agency to explore issues of equity and diversity as concrete instances with the learning environment.

I favour its enaction via a sketchy pedagogies, an incomplete process inviting participation.

In this section, agency in the particiption in game making community is seen as  complex and multi-dimensional

- agency is seen beyond a individualised property, as participation in a community.
- agency is ideally part of a utopian process, and thus as equity [Gutierrez]
- as , diversity, enacted, concrete, thus towards inclusion


Fluidity of practice of participants for characteristics of an emerging inclusive, idioculture

Learner agency in the form of choice over the  chosen activity is present not only in the dimensions of the difficulty and theme of the game features they wished to add, but also in their approach to undertaking it.

The conception of development of repertoires of practices is key to this interpretation.

As such, I draw on concrete example of repertoire in my research as a case study contribution to applied research in this promising field.


<!-- ORIGINAL NOTE : KEEP THE FOCUS ON TOOLS HERE - SIGNPOST TO OTHER SECTIONS IF NEEDED. -->


#### Returning to transformational agency here and how it different from conceptions of developing repertoires of practice

**How can we best conceive agency here?**


**Comparing relational agency to transformational agency**

How structural and permanent does transformational agency needs to be before it becomes transformational compared to a more blended view of emerging repertoires of practice.



Conceptions of AT are evolving including a 4th generation which responds to increasingly rapid and evolving situations.

### Metaphors of harbours and playgrounds as a way to explore conceptions of (relational) agency


#### Utility of metaphors of space

The use of metaphor here has two functions. The first is to help deepen my analysis via a move to the abstract, to search for communicable generalisations. Secondly, given the non-traditional nature of this approach, and bearing in mind previous reflections on the difficulty of communicating approaches to practitioners (e.g Microworld by Kynigos), I draw on metaphors as a supporting tool. One in line with utopian methodology proposed by Cole and Gutierrez.  

In this case metaphors concerning learning spaces and movement between spaces are often found in existing research including: walled gardens, playgrounds, sandboxes, harbours. This section aims to draw from these metaphors relatable core principles which may help the impact of this research.

**Complexity of the findings and emerging pedagogy**

Beyond practical aspects of dissemination, a further challenge associated with the overall goal of bringing a complex, flexible, learner-driven pedagogy to bear, is addressed by Kynigos , in articulating the limitation of updake of ideas surrounding Microworlds.

There are a lot of moving parts in the final pedagogy and while I have put in work to address foundational aspects using relatable metaphors, the target audience in terms of coding enviroment designers, represents challenges in terms of complexity.  

I do brand it , and provide useful contributions in concrete instances of work


#### Harbours - authentic and restrictive


**Characteristics of a harbour**

Harbours are protective spaces suitable for docking of ships, at times natural or man-made with protection offered by artificially created harbour walls extending out into the sea creating a sheltered space, prevent large waves from entering but also allowing movement out into the open sea, the possibility for refuelling or maintaining sea vessels and infrastructure to connect to rail or road links for transport in-land. The term harbour is used metaphorically to indicate a space of safety, nurturing and a gathering space for like minds.


**Design as simplification / abstraction**

SUMMARISE - MOVE EXTRA / EXAMPLES UP TO THE FIRST SECTION - FIND A GOOD PLACE FOR IT.

Many design decisions were made to create a supported, simplified coding environment. Relevant examples from the previous chapter include: using an online code playground; skirting use of specialist terminology; hiding away un-needed complexity in the code template.

The motivations for creating starter templates are similar for both educators and professional template creators. The goal being to want to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency.  



**The magic of working in authentic waters**

The intrigue  of opening up previously mysterious areas and seeing or experimenting with what makes them tick is explored in Ch.2.

The same principle applies here in early stages of the learning experience. The process of clicking remix to fix a broken, half baked game involves viewing and altering code in unfamiliar territory, even if the code template has been simplified it is still an authentic tool set, and thus motivational [FIND SOURCE]


This strong alignment with authentic, professional practice may help learners transition to other forms of web coding projects, due to the similarity of as this element of practice.
CH.5

My design decision to build the toolset as structure on top of authentic tools and languages can be likened to creating a protective harbour to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency.


**The same value of protection from a complex environment applies to accessing documentation.**

Participants are able to leave the protective harbour by accessing more authentic documentation and moving beyond existing templates. The experience may be involve choppier waters but the tools and processes remain familiar.


While it is important to acknowledge the danger that such support may make learners run into trouble if coding other projects outside of this supported space, the use of authentic code language makes this less of an issues than with specialised coding environments aimed at novices [@hagge_coding_2018]. Thus to make one addition to the metaphor this design is like a sea-harbour, tools like Scratch are like a swimming pool.

This curated replication of authentic process of finding and incorporating code snippets into the starting template supported the development of skills used in professional coding communities.

**An example?**

Also participants can change the genre, See Toby and Dan in Vignette x.

#### Fluency in Jam Session - was Playgrounds, sandboxes and play spaces

<!-- The freedoms and restrictions of playgrounds -->

A similar metaphorical dimension of protection is present in metaphors of play spaces. The web-based environment which reduce the complexity of web development and provide community and immediate feedback are named code playgrounds.

Additionally, the process of checking the performance of games is called play-testing, with connotations of a playful, and therefore social space. The sandbox metaphor is used extensively in web development to indicate a safety in terms of non-critical space to trial new code and make mistakes.

While the play space evokes protection, there is still space for wilder behaviours to emerge as play is responsive and adaptive. In this study playtesting spaces are important as a means to allow learners to evolve their own processes as a form of authorial and transformational agency, albeit within the suggested limitations. Similarly this tension between freedom and structure is present in the concept of jam sessions.

**Jam Sessions as a playful space inviting improvisation within a struture**

Beyond a space for play, I wish to proposed play in a musical sense within the space of a musical jam session.

In the previous chapter, I explored the flexible nature of emerging design behaviours and proposed them as a form of improvisation.
The building of fluency in competency is also present. Some young participants became remarkably swift and adapt at thus transforming chains of actions into a fluid operation.

DEVELOP THIS METAPHOR

= infrastructure in terms of drums, microphones and amps are provided.
- standards emerge , played regularly, the is a  chance to hear people's version before you try one are
- there is a chord structure of a song, and the key in which it is performed, forming a base from improvisation to take hold,
- visual clues and encouragement may be present in line with socio-cultural forms of support, and conceptions of relational agency.


<!-- While the distributed nature of the toolset, hindered peer learning in P1 as too many tools were introduced, in P2 it helped build authentic digital literacy skills.  -->




 <!-- and the presence of affordances suggesting a particular form of action. For example a roundabout, or climbing frame in a playground invites a certain kind of interaction.


Thus in the design of this study

- template affordences,
- GDP menu as affordences

Other affordances of the design would encourage greater authorial (and relational agency), for example those designed to build user's sense of belonging in the game making community.

In this research, similar metaphors have emerged in the pedagogical and technical process surrounding the concept of playgrounds and gardens. In the previous section the use of a curated set of design patterns can be thought of as play areas or equipemtn inviting interaction.
 -->

<!-- **Games and play spaces**

These metaphors invite a connection to play theories concept of as the magic circle. Play theorist outline the value of stepping into a more controlled area of voluntary experimentation where the fear of failure is reduced. Game rules are norms which seed participation in community processes.

The concepts of affective space and magic circle  as a way to encourage participants to improvise from a starting structure are of value to provide guidance to practitioners in the domain of informal digital design.

The playful context of the game's magic circle can facilitate participants to adapt norms and rules to their own playing styles. Through this lens, the interaction of playtesting, code playgrounds and a sandbox of game patterns emerge as a key practices to facilitate and maintain learner agency. The discussion of the next chapter explores the intersection of these elements in more detail. -->

### Addressing the nature of my contribution to research landscape

The section above outlined contributions to the research landscape intersecting with the development of the learning design of the study.

A critique could be leveled against this contribution that the alignment with existing pedagogical frameworks suggests a more minimal contribution: representing a kind of _tinkering around the edges_ of existing work.

While I hope the framing of the previous section of the novel positioning of those concepts within new context addresses this concern, the challenging of such an interpretation is also an important motivational concern of this work.  

In line with a tradition of other researchers, this work celebrates the creative value of a bricolage approach [], or in other words a "re-mediatation" of the existing forms of pedagogies.

It is from the concrete, practical, collaborative struggle of how to jointly make a game making community and to build fluency in the process of making games that this research emerges. And as such the concrete, responsive, re-assembling of existing pedagogies and elements of the learning activity systems is a integral tactic here aligned with a recent socio-cultural concerns.  

_This shift from “fixing” the individual to re-mediating and transforming the functional system is key to reimagining new
forms of learning and doing science that are tied to the imaginings of new futures, trajectories, and identities (Gutierrez, Morales, & Martinez, 2009) [@gutierrez_re-mediating_2009-2] in [@gutierrezpossibilities2015-1]_


However it is of value to explore how transferrable these findings are to other contexts of learning, and other genres of digital making, or beyond to other project based approaches.

## Conclusion



**Wrapping up in narrative?**

In AT terminology, this chapter has in a general sense returned to the concrete (see Marx / Blunden).

Chapter four outlined a design narrative where tools were chosen and adapted by myself and Participants in response to local context. Chapter five explored the emerging organisational unit of GDPs, and how they were used as meditational strategies.  

This chapter has explored emergent cultural and community activity, and deepened discussion on interpersonal activity, and then returned to discuss implications for dimensions of concrete tool use on learner agency.

It's dialectic innit. We call it praxis.

The methodology chapter outlined some of the challenges of this approach, particularly in the thick description of context, and the challenge of then satisfying the goal of generalisability / and overall utitlity.

The final chapters aims to address this with  recommendations for facilitators and researchers. The scope of the applicability is addressed as the findings of this thesis can inform the wider debate of how to best support project based learning in wider domains. Specifically the use of concrete design frameworks and step-based iterative project in scaffolding PBL.

## TO MOVE OR DROP FROM CHAPTER



### On planned and emergent activity)

MOVE TO A DISCUSSION SECTION?
COMPRESS FOR INTRO?
THIS IS PART OF DBR - REFERENCE THAT IF IT IS STILL NEEDED FOR THE CHAPTER.



The previous chapters have described interventions in design that can be characterised on a spectrum between those planned and introduced by myself as a facilitator and those which were emergent, i.e. invented or adopted by participants as a response to the contradictions covered in chapter four.  

The distinction between planned and emergent activities became blurred as practices merged. In Chapter 6 outlines that while  I tool a lead to collate game design patterns into an organised collection with accompanying resources and a navigational menu, many of these patterns, were introduced  initially by participants who recognised them and wanted to add them to their own games.

This aligns with a key characteristic of formative intervention and DBR. Namely that elements of the introduced design changed responsive to learner need as the design evolved through iterations. Some introduced  processes outlined in this chapter were very minimal in embryonic form but extended significantly by participants.


AT theory emphasises that the process of activity does not start in a vacuum. This helps justify the formative intervention process which is active in intervention and in the initial shaping of activity. In an educational context, this can involve introduction of tasks as starting activities to shape. This is justified conceptually from a view of not restricting participant agency in that some form of activity should be suggested in order for them to make a rational choice as to weather to participate. It follows that this activity should encourage the communication that participant choice is significant in the design.

<!-- NOTE - NOTES ON THE CULTURE OF HARDNESSS - FIT IN SOMEWHERE IF APPROPRIATE

When explored from game making perspective the hard is good lens, is limiting in terms of building the engagement of players. However, culturally the desire to make games hard for other participants is more understandable in the context of retro games. .

- arcade games were designed to be hard to extract money from players
- nes games reputation for being brutal as they often had no way to save states, and much of the games challenge, due to limitations of number of levels or modes of playing, depended on this 'hardness'
- this developed later for snes games , finding challenge and other forms of ways of maintaining interest for different genres of games_
- retro games are associated therefore with being brutal and frustrating.
- thus in some ways the process of making a hard game is a way of getting your own back at all the games that have frustrated

### Building Identities as Game Makers  - EXTENDED

PARK THIS FOR NOW IN DESIGN CHAPER

COULD RETURN TO THIS IN A DISCUSSION CHAPTER - AS HAS IMPACT ON GDP TOO.

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with the positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you. -->

MOVE THIS SOMEHOW INTO A DISCUSSION AREA
#### Helpers supporting supportive community behaviours

While not a key part of this study, it is of value to briefly examine the role of student helpers in this phase.
One of their remits was to support the work of participants and to guide reflection by asking simple questions like "What have you been working on?", What are you working on now. What do you want to add to your game. Beyond this, students also gave feedback between playtestings sessions, connected different participants, supported parental behaviours,   into the design process via debriefing sessions. In journal notes I made observations and gathered feedback, while not fo extensively studied there is potential here.
Especialy in the potential to replicate family supportive behaviours with non-expert facilitators in a volunteering settings, specifically with bespoke guidance to support game making.

 <!-- As mentioned in the previous sections, after analysis of this vignette in particular, it seemed promising to investigate behaviour and engagement at different stages of design process for this pair. To do this I have made extensive notes and used a coding structure for two complete sessions of this parent-child pair. The following observations have been made by comparing the codes on stages of design and types of participant interaction. This data was then triangulated participant feedback and my own journal notes. The observations are presented themed by the design stages used in the coding process with some general observations listed at the end of this section. -->

<!-- #### Discussion on design stages and GDP for this pair - DROP THIS?

 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.
 This parent was much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents. The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker/player type (concepts explored in previous chapter). This interpretation seems confirmed by less social interactions compared to may parents. The pair engaged far less in play testing of other games and peer support to overcome barriers. They also followed the stages of design more closely than may other groupings, an observation which is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

 This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." This alternation is driven or facilitated by the different stages of implementing GDPs. The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

 Using the coded data from nvivo to compare design cycle stages with pair collaboration, it can be observed that the most likely stages for pair collaboration were during the Ask/Imagine stage, Testing and Planning.

 The vignette shows evidence of that the actions of the parent to re-engage the child at different stages of the design cycle helped sustain the child's engagement in the more focused design process happening on the screen. However, an opposing pattern of behaviour may also be valid. When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups. Within Rogoff's model of community of learners [-@rogoff_developing_1994], this observation is viewed as valid form of participation. The child's ability to legitimately disengage from pair coding to observe the work and interactions of others in this emerging community of learners may also be sustaining.

 It is of note that when describing the design cycle for this family that this family along with others are working with decomposed smaller design challenges in the form of implementing GDPs. Thus the cycle is repeated for each new pattern that the pair take on. These smaller design iterations can be expressed within the framework of AT as an activity system. -->

 <!-- #### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

 NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION?
  NOTE - This more general observation may be part of the previous chapter

 We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

 - The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
 - This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

 Discussion

 - The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

 The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity. -->

<!-- Because of the common use of design stages as a conceptual design tool.
And a prevalence of research linking design thinking  stages  and coding. I coded data to that. When coding data a design cycle framework was one of the code structures. Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share. However, when coding I quick became aware that naturalistic practice rarely matched the progression of the design cycle. The stages were instead fragmented and sometimes happened in parallel. -->


<!-- When designing program to prioritise learner engagement on to respond to their interests I found over structuring activity via design stages may be not be productive. The emerging process in this design related more closely to tinkering methodologies (previous explored). -->

<!-- However, while tinkering and improvisational approaches have been advocated in the domains of hands-on STEM exhibits in museums as part of the Maker movement, they have been less adopted in the domain of learning computer coding. -->

<!-- One side effect of coding by design cycle stage was to expose the limits of even an iterative cycle interpretation of the design process of these participants. -->
<!-- There is little data on the effectiveness of value even of explicitly teaching design thinking / engineering stages. -->
<!-- I did not give explicit facilitator input or guidance on the stages which may also have avoided norming participants towards such patterns. -->

<!-- Another cause for a less stuctured was the use of a templated game which contained andauthenticity which invited testing and sharing with after only quick changes. -->

<!-- While computer design stages taught using perspective stages approaches [Waterfall etc], there has been a more recent move towards agile, iterative approaches which allow for more flexible and responsive working processes. -->


<!-- In other areas of creative processes the concept of jamming is potentially useful as a grounding. -->

<!-- #### Designing to incorporate learner identity

NOTE - INCLUDE HOME ED CONTEXT TO AN EXTENT TO PRECEED LATER CAVEATS IN CONCLUSION

Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].

This chapter supports this research and also finds game making as  a suitable medium to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

Conceptually, within AT, these interventions and design choices which yield possibilities for self-exploration can be see as potential anchor points to increase learner agency.

In summary:

Family game making, of completing projects together with your parents or siblings has potential to remove the **I'm not that sort of person** barrier of cultural identity as participants are surrounded by their people.

  - the choice of retro games as a medium provokes sharing for older participants while their enduring popularity maintains common ground with younger participants;

The full process and rationale and initial reactions are detailed in appendix 4.x . In summary,

The process was very engaging, parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital identities of their children. As part of the process I then proposed that there different game maker types and asked participants to evaluate and discuss with peers what kind of game maker they were. From the following list.

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

**A tension in use of norming practices and participant choice?**
However, as a seeming counterpoint to this growing agency is the norming effects of concepts that gain community currency in playtesting. The repeated attempts by participants to make the jumping mechanic of Molly less frustrating can be seen as a potential drag on the agency or autonomy of Molly as a designer. However this may be a false dichotomy. Such norming practices can be seen from a different perspective according to Rogoff, as a productive nudge to get real.

#### Community concepts and norming behaviour emerging during playtesting

MOVE BACK TO CHAPTER 6 IF SPACE?

NOTE THERE IS SOMETHING HERE ABOUT ME STEPPING BACK AND LETTING THE COMMUNITY EVOLVE.

Ed gives a more technical explanation from  involving the naming of the variable _jump speed_.

Other children come and play the game but only for less than a minute before leaving. Towards the end of the playtesting process, as one child leaves, Molly comments "It's so frustrating." This suggests an evolving understanding that her game is frustrating to players rather than pleasantly challenging.

The indirect norming behaviours described in appendix 5.Norm.x mirror observations seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues [@rogoff_cultural_2003] on learning in  community settings.

There is an apparent tension in play here between encouraging individual agency of expression within the game and an evolving community tendency to norm peoples games to be more _playable_, specifically that player movement should conforming to wider expectations.

What we can draw from the data at this stage is that playtesing provides many leverage points to facilitating learner agency and discuss the limits of designs. IN addition, playtesting is a process that allows participants to demonstrate informed criticality as a player and guide the creations of peers via gameplay feedback.

This process is an example of an emerging process where cultural concepts are mutually constituted by all actors involved in the game making activity system. While the concepts of hardness and challenge that emerge and not concrete examples of GDPS, they are the results of changed GDPs. The next chapter explores similar data on the use of GDP related concepts by participants and the resultant potential impact on participant agency.


<!-- #### Why prioritise local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community - and how are they different in character? PERHAPS DROP IF NOT NEEDED OR KEEP REALLY SHORT. AND MERGE UP.

While a lot of other research has focused on community as an online phenomenon, in this research that aspect has not been explored.

This section explores my decision to prioritise local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community as well as  how are they different in character.

One reason was practical,  a suitable online community pitched at children or even at novices was not apparent using the chosen tools set.

The advantages of this decision is that interactions play out off the screen, the limited games available increase community interaction, as participants drew only from a small pool of locally created games.

While there is convincing research on on how online community  can engender feelings of agency and motivation [ROQUE AND ITO AND GEE], I chose not to connect with existing online communities in this learning design. Online communities can serve as a form of authentic feedback as explored in the Scratch and New Grounds community websites. However, the process of being involved in an online community and in addition learning the processes of participation diverts time and focus from other activities including real life playtesting.

In addition, the diversity of creations available on a online community may also have detracted from the more shared experience of the template used. Not offering a choice of starting game helped this shared technical and cultural base.      -->



####  MoE

One area of research which was explored in this learning design but which has needed to be deprioritise is that of Mantle of the Expert and the permission to play and experiment which the drama process advocates.

While a fuller exploration of how this was put into practice in P3 via a narrative which wrapped around the making activity, it is relevant to the use of side missions, and the possibility for character exploration in terms of a maker type.

#### **An example of mini TADS - use of secondary resources**
 <!-- REFLECTION ON BRICOLAGE? -->
An illustrative design tension emerged surrounding which kind of documentation to prioritise. After initially steering participants directly to code snippets, I subsequently directed them instead to step by step tutorials which also included a link to the code snippets. I shifted between prioritising instruction-based practices and more piecemeal, bricolage inspired (see LR) developer practices. Whilst the process of instruction is problematic in terms of learner agency this vies with the practicality to establish a common understanding and shared framework for production.

a theme explored in more detail in chapter five
Traditional, printed, instruction-based software manuals are in decline partly due online documentation but also due to the increased intuitive nature of their design [@pogue_user_2017].

vThe careful alignment between navigational documentation and the participants driving objectives of the mid-level activity system of implementing a game element, also helped avoid mismatch between task and tools described above as mismatch between primary and secondary stimuli.

## Research output 1 - Applied pedagogy - IN CONCLUSION?

### The interaction of flexible deign practices, the collection of Game Design Patterns, stepwise scaffolding of learning environments and new understandings of agency.

<!-- BRING IN A SUMMARY OF LEARNING FROM THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER ON GDPS. -->

In the previous chapter we explored the use of GDPs as a possible response to the challenges to project work and the lack of domain specific frameworks. The nature of the framework provided by game play design patterns has been be explored through the lens of agency.

This section synthesises the learning design with such interpretations.

And then progresses to recap the potential of this synthesis of these process, framed in other writing as a 3M approach.

Finally it links the the outputs with the research process in terms of the impact of DBR and formative intervention approaches.

#### Summary of observations contributions of novel aspect of the learning design (PERHAPS MERGE WITH BELOW)

While the base structuring of the starting template drew on concepts of UMC and half-baked game design, the use of a menu of GDPs to scaffold the modify and create stage is a novel approach.

The potential of this innovation is significant in scope. Firstly, the surfacing of GDPs as a germ cell concept, facilitated the developmetn of in different "stepped" progressively graded project briefs which build one upon the other as a flexible scaffold (HOW?), in a way which helps address the tension between freedom of choice of learner pathway, and expression of interest within a manageable technical structure (with relevant supporting documentation).

This alignment with a  rhizomatic approach within a structure has been explored in this thesis using a metaphor of a harbour in terms of the conceptualisation of the design from a facilitator / designers point of view. The habour walls represent the restrictive decisions in terms of the genre of end product, and simplifications in code structures participants must understand or create to make progress.

From a participants' perspective I liken their experience to the process of jamming an informal musical practice.

While The value of playtesting as a practice is surfaced either explicitly in professional game making

Other sections of this research The use of social missions to support the variety of development.


#### Synthesis of Characteristics and Analysis in relation to what they contribute to existing frameworks


- The role of authenticity and the impact on agency

These varied forms of documentation, and their varied adoption and propagation represent different approaches to  scaffolding the process of becoming familiar with and then modifying to the code in often increasingly ambitious ways inline with the stages and ethos of a

- UDL / PBL

Key characteristics of structuring support around quick start activities and a subsequent menu of GDPs which align with existing research include:

The use of a menu / collection of resources can be considered an inclusive educational practice and offer a rich description of a concrete example which aims to align to inclusive, practice-based frameworks like UDL and PBL. While this may involve more work in advance, the benefits to inclusive practice merit it.



#### Questions and  Conceptual challenges to dissemination - MOVE PERHAPS TO NEXT CHAPTER?

**How broadly can the principles be applied?**

The general use of design patterns to guide digital creation are widely replicable, that of coupling documentation. The UMC methodology applies more broadly to design based education via prototyping. which could take other formats. Thus it is potentially applicable to other domains. And example of such is in PBL work using a campaign template and characteristics ads design patters, and a Poster, and elevator pitch feedback before creating then a stall [blog post].
