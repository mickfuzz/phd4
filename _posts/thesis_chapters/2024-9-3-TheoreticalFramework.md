## Introduction

The focus of this study is on the construction of shared meaning and practices as part of an emerging community of game makers. As my study seeks to address cultural factors which act as barriers to participation in digital making, it requires a method of research which allows the detailed description and evaluation of complex, emergent learning environments. The ability to study context, transformation and the development of participant agency are vital to the concerns of this study. To serve these ends I adopt cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) as a guiding theory, operationalised using formative interventions as a variant of design based research (DBR).

This chapter describes the guiding theoretical framework and key concepts which are relevant to the development of the thesis. As activity theory emerged from a movement know as a _social turn_ in psychology [@sugiman_social_2008], thus, a brief this chapter begins with a brief description of this movement. The foundational concepts of activity theory (AT) are then explored before turning  AT's evolution in the form of CHAT and third generation activity theory (3GAT) and more recent forms of cultural exploration. Then, in order to explore the enactment of CHAT in a research setting, DBR, and varied forms of formative interventions are analysed. The final section of the chapter looks specifically at understanding surrounding the development of agency within the theoretical framework of activity theory.

<!-- The underlying approach of this chapter is closely aligned with the activity theory concept of expansive learning within formative interventions. It also uses methods widely adopted in design based research (DBR) -->

<!-- My own research in game making is an experimental approach to create a new learning design. I have worked with young learners, local families and undergraduate student helpers to evolve a game making design. A key driver of my research was to explore the potential to draw on family experience in learning activities by working with families to make games together. -->

## The social turn

This section addresses a turn away from a psychological approach towards a more social understanding learning and human behaviour[@sugiman_social_2008]. While this turn has impact in several disciplines, it is in learning that is the focus of this study. This social _turn_ in psychology, involved a turn away from assumptions that studying human mental activity should be carried out in isolated, context free methods [@stetsenko_activity_2005]. The reasoning behind this shift is present not only to address validity of results[@brown_design_1992] but also the value of the research for designers and participants
[@barnett_ecosystem_2019]. This perspective allows a transcendence of conceptions of transmission models of learning to embrance the value of group-based, participatory processes.

The work of Brown [@brown_design_1992] as prominent researcher within psychology advocating the importance of context within experimental design helped legitimise this focus, and facilitate a broad uptake in diverse fields. The growing work in these varied fields sometimes grouped by the term _learning sciences_, can be viewed in terms of a move way from randomised control trials and their attempt of severance of context away from a behaviourist view of learning as an internal psychology process, towards a diverse set of disciplines and tools drawn from emerging field of cognitive and cultural psychology [@hoadley_learning_2011]. While this fragmentation can be seen as positive in terms of pluralism and interdisciplinary sharing of knowledge between fields as diverse as education, anthropology and computer science, is also a source of criticism in lacking an overall coherence in underlying understandings of the learning and human activity on a deeper conceptual level [@hoadley_learning_2011].

 <!-- <- FIND A BETTER ONE / ENGESTROM?. -->

The work of Michael Cole in Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC) [@cole_comparative_1981]. In his narrative account of his own turn towards a social understanding of learning and activity in the book Cultural Psychology, Cole [@cole_cultural_1996] critiques the emerging trend of behaviourist and cognitive psychology towards interpretations that reduce the minds as an information processing unit rather than one component in complex cultural activity. While there have been varied schools influenced by the turn towards studying learning in context, I have chosen to use Cole's articulation of activity theory as a base for the the theoretical framework of this study due to the overall coherence of the approach and its ability to deal effectively with bother wider cultural impacts on the focus on activity, and detail of narrower actions.  

I take a broad approach to applying activity theory, drawing on 3GAT, with its attendance to systemic analysis and particular techniques and understandings of agency, the work of Cole and the importance of institutional mutuality, and the work of Rogoff in particular the attention paid to _linguistic and cultural-historical repertoires_ [@rogoff_cultural_2003]

<!-- The unifying factor in these approaches is the acceptance of unit of analysis being activity, a unit between the learner their objective and their surrounding context [@rogoff_childrens_1993]. -->

While activity theory provides the base for this work, I also incorporate some elements of theoretical approaches from wider sections of the learning sciences, in particular design based research (DBR), to address issues of utility of research [@hoadley_creating_2002-1] and perceived utility of research [@barnett_ecosystem_2019]. This chapter explores and justifies this choice and in a later section begins to describe how these concepts are operationalised in the setting of this study. To do this I begin by outlining the history and foundational concepts of activity theory.

<!-- ### Other cultural historical approaches Communities of Practice and Learners Before

Rogoff's concept of communities of learners and Lave and Wegner's community of practice are helpful illustrations of the social turn

## The foundational concepts of activity theory


<!-- For more history also see [@sannino_learning_2009, p. 5] -->

Before outlining the concepts driving activity theory, a short history here places them in context. For Marx human endeavour and change is based on activity and the subject of that activity is understood as the person or people driving it [@marx1975marx; @blunden_interdisciplinary_2009]. Vygotsky drew on Marxist conceptions of the importance of human activity as social mediated process, applied the core concepts to broader understandings of the learning process [@blunden_interdisciplinary_2010]. While Vygotsky's student Leontiev formulated the work of Vygotsky into a prototypal activity theory (explored shortly), AT had stagnated in the repressive context of the USSR [@blunden_interdisciplinary_2010] and had limited take up in western academia before Cole's translations of Vygotsky's work [@cole_mind_1978]. This work to bring some of the foundational concepts into an educational psychology setting, at the time of the broader social turn in the discipline.

The work in this emerging field of cultural psychology  by scholars such as Wertsch [@wertsch_vygotsky_1985] and Cole [@cole_cultural_1996] explores the vital role of cultural mediation in human development in general and more specifically community and context in the studies of learning, situating learning pedagogies as form of meditational strategy. Before progressing to study the work of Cole and others in context, it is of value to examine Core concepts in activity theory (AT). Nardi and Kaptelinin outline activity theory as a series of foundational concept which form the base for wider theories [@kaptelinin_acting_2009; @wertsch_concept_1981], namely: object-orientedness, tool mediation, hierarchical structure of activity, ongoing development of activity  development, and psychological internalisation and externalisation.

<!-- This use of objects, concepts which facilitate and constituent cultural participation. The role of cultural mediation in development, and role of objects to study human culture [@cole_beyond_1996; @cole_culture_1995]. -->


  <!-- ### Core concepts in activity theory (AT) -->



<!-- While this study is on community activity, some of the concepts and tools of AT inherit meaning from a tradition of exploring personal psychology and thus a clarification of the terms used in a community setting is helpful. To help make this process more concrete, at times I will give examples related to the context of this study. -->


<!-- ### Object / objective in activity and varied interpretations -->

A starting  point in the exploration of key concepts of AT is Vygotsky formulation of the conception of activity the relation between subject, object and tools. Activity theory is seen as object-oriented in that understanding of human organisation and learning are based on activity driven by the goals or objectives of the individual or collective subject [@engestrom_learning_1987-1]. Kaptelinin and colleagues [@kaptelinin_activity_1995] note that while the materialist focus of the Marxist roots of activity theory has led some descriptions to focus on the object as the physical object being worked on and being transformed by the activity, conceptual objects are also included in Leontiev concept of activity theory [@leontev_problem_1974]. Thus the term object is best understood within the context of wider motivation or objective. To clearly represent subject and object in a way which represents Vygotsky's overcoming of the problems associated subject-object, mind-body, Cartesian dualism [@still1991mutual], this relationship was developed by Vygotsky's student Leontiev into a triadic relationship to including tools which mediate activity.. [@engestrom_learning_1987-1] See fig 3.x below.

![](./Pictures/At_dia_6_basicer_v1.png){width=90%}
Fig. 3.x essential conception of Activity

<!-- It also helps identify conflicts between the stated objective of the system and the actual objective of participants. -->

<!-- Indeed, in many complex environments more than one physical or conceptual object is at play. Paying attention to the objective of AT systems is important as it helping to differentiate the scope of activity systems [barab? / blunden].   -->

<!-- ### Mediation -->

Turning to mediation via tools, Vygotsky's concept of tools here is broad including language, physical tools and representational concepts [@cole_mind_1978]. Mediation is of particular relevance to this study as the learning environment involved varied, dynamic forms of tool use. Physical, digital and conceptual tools evolve as a product of the experience of others in society and are thus a product of adaptation, containing within then evidence evolutionary processes of culture. This study situates pedagogies as forms of meditational strategy which can be drawn on by both facilitators and learners [@donato_sociocultural_1994; @gutierrez_re-mediating_2009].

<!-- NEEDS DEVELOPMENT -->

<!-- **Internalisation and externalisation** -->

For Vygotsky, the process of mediation via conceptual tools is examined through mutual processes of internalisation and externalisation of activity [@kaptelinin_activity_1995-1]. Learners are actively processing and make sense of the world by both appropriating cultural learning from cultural practices and then by contributing back into shared cultural understandings of the world. This two way process is well described in learning context by Rogoff via a personal process she calls participatory appropriation [@rogoff_observing_1995]. Here Rogoff situates Vygotsky's concept of appropriation beyond an internalisation of external concepts experienced in society, as an ongoing and reciprocal contribution to practices and concepts in-situ. This distinction is important as a refutation of transmission based models of learning. Rogoff also cites this personal dimension as one key plane of three important in the study of community activity.    

    "Inherent to the participatory appropriation view is the mutual constitution of personal, interpersonal, and cultural processes." [@rogoff_observing_1995, p.154].

These planes are explored in a later section of this chapter.

<!-- ### The hierarchical structure of activity -->
<!-- #### Activity, Actions and Operations -->

To describe activity systems with greater granularity,  Leontiev [-@leontiev_activity_2009], used terms and concepts of actions and operations happening which constitute a vertical hierarchy of activity structure. Activity works on a level of an overall motive and _actions_ are a smaller component sub-goals to needed to achieve the wider goal of the activity. As we descend this hierarchy, underneath actions are series of unconscious _operations_ carried out fluently in the process of undertaking actions. See figure below from [@daniels_vygotsky_2001, p.87].

![](./Pictures/At_dia_7_hierarchy_v1.png){width=90%}

Figure 3. x -  hierarchical structure of activity (adpated from  [@daniels_vygotsky_2001, p.87])

The concept of fluency is key to this study, as such it is important to be able to locate and describe these chains of operations and actions. Kutti [@kuutti_activity_1995] describes a shift from actions to operations in the following way.  

    Initially each operation is a conscious action, consisting of both the orientation and execution phases, but when the corresponding model is good enough and the action has been practiced long enough, the orientation phase will fade and the action will be collapsed into an operation, which is much more fluent." [@kuutti_activity_1995]

In addition, activity systems are also sometimes conceived as being nested within wider activity systems, for example the development and teaching of a series of lessons may take place within the wider activity of a school or university [@lewin_developing_2018-1; @barab_using_2002]. Thus the choice of which activity system to analyse in depth, is described as the process of finding an appropriate unit of analysis [@blunden_germ_2014]. For example, in Barab et al's research on a changes to a university course, a granular exploration of the tensions and processes at work in a complex educational environment is used to identify emerging barriers and responses to comprehension and communication. This level of detail which facilitated its replicability and utility to other practitioners, is used as a justification for using a smaller activity system than that typically represented in Engeström's approach [@engestrom_learning_1987-1; @lave_developmental_1993; @barab_using_2002]. Similarly, in this thesis, while game making at a community project studied as a system, interpersonal activity is also examined using an activity system of a smaller scope. This is explored in more detail in Chapter 4.

-->

<!-- This concept of shifting focus from individual activity to that of an expanded and shared object has parallels with more observational research on collective activity [@ rogoff_observing_1995]. -->

<!-- The key difference is the intervention of the researcher to create space, time and circumstances to facilitate the shift and production of new understandings of the activity in question. -->

<!-- When mapping onto AT in a practical purpose of data analysis these planes can be seen as manifestations in different scopes of activty. -->

While units of analysis are often chosen on an broad scope to allow for sociological concepts to emerge, Blunden makes a pragmatic proposal to use projects as they key unit of analysis [-@blunden_interdisciplinary_2010; -@blunden#### Development and design -->


<!-- In the case of this study, activity can be seen as different planes; wider educational context and the culture of the whole program; guided activity; specific actions and operations carried out on a personal level. -->

<!-- Here the term project here communicates a concrete implementation of a planned goal and also a sense that all elements of key activity are present at this level e.g. all stages of the design cycle (and another example?).  This sentiment is echoed by a parent when noticing that the documentation on one GDPs involved several distinct stages - "It’s like a project in itself really!" -->

<!-- At this scope, for participants implementing . -->


In terms of development, activity theory views activity as constantly evolving within its context. The theory is grounded in Marxist dialectical materialism, which suggests that activity is a dynamic system best understood through its transformations [@ilyenkov1960dialectics]. A major driver of transformation in activity is the emergence and resolution of contradictions and conflicts, which arise from the build-up of tensions within the activity itself [@ilyenkov1960dialectics; @blunden_activity_2023]. Engeström’s work on what he called the third generation of activity theory includes the theory of expansive learning, which traces the changes and growth of the object being worked on. This often occurs due to tensions extending beyond a single activity system to involve others, acknowledging the influence of actors moving between systems [@engestrom_expansive_2001]. Along with Cole’s work, this is crucial for expanding beyond a narrow view of activity and engaging with cross-cultural understandings of learning [@cole_cross-cultural_1988]. These concepts are further explored in the section on expansive learning below.


## Strands of emerging variations of Activity Theory

As part of the growing uptake of AT beyond the USSR,  researchers forged new concepts in these varied strands of activity theory. Terms evolve over time and and used differently in varied settings. The following disambiguation is offered to address this in this context of this study. Activity theory AT is used to refer to underlying principles as described above. Cultural historial approach  and cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) broad application of those principles which at times concepts associated sociocultural approaches: these include concept  including communities of learners [@rogoff_developing_1994], communities of practice [@lave_situated_1991], and social design experiments [@gutierrez2020utopian]. The term third generation activity theory (3GAT) is used to refer to Engeström's more specific interpretation of AT when a distinction is needed.

The next section explores concepts within two broad strands of activity. The first is that of third generation activity theory (3GAT), centred around the work of Engeström and colleagues in Finland. The second is a more loosely grouped strand of researchers based on a tradition of both the soviet tradition at AT described above and American pragmatism in the tradition of Dewey. This body of work aligned with CHAT principles from the work of Michael Cole and colleagues, carried out to a great extent within the context of funding programme and publications of learning sciences, includes concepts of funds of knowledge, ideocultures and legitimate peripheral participation which are relevant to this study.

### 3GAT and Expansive learning

Addressing the first strand, 3GAT represents an important development of conceptual tools to apply activity to authentic learning settings.  Engeström concept of the activity system model extends Leontiev's work via a triangular representation of key cultural aspects of the activity in question. The model features a further tier cultural factors including, norms and rules, division of labour and community [@engestrom_learning_1987-1].


![](./Pictures/At_dia_5_basic_v1.png){width=90%}
Figure 3. x - Engeström's representation of community concepts an activity system

Engeström visually represents Leontiev's focus on issues of the wider community (those involved in activity beyond the subjects themselves), division of labour (either through division of tasks between community member or a more vertical power structure) and the emergence of rules or norms (guiding and emerging community behaviours) [@sannino_cultural-historical_2018].  

<!-- The emergence of divisions of labour and rules can be linked to Rogoff's concepts of cultural repertoires [@rogoff_cultural_2003].
LATER? -->

<!-- #### Expansive learning and expanded object -->

To address 3GAT expands its focus to encompass the role of interacting activity systems, the movement of subjects between systems and the possibility for joint work on a shared object. The recognition of wider activity systems and the transfer of motivations and practices of actors into new systems is represented in Engeström's view of AT [@spinuzzi_trying_2020-1]. This shared, or expanded object being worked on by more than one activity system is represented in Fig 3.x below.

![](./Pictures/shared_object_engestrom.png){width=90%}

Figure 3. x - Engeström's concept of expansive learning via a shared object, from [@sannino_formative_2016] [@engestrom_methodological_2014]

To explain this relationship more clearly an example in context is helpful. In research on a joint activity involving school, Cakir and colleagues represent the joint activity as an objective share between school, family and researchers.

![](./Pictures/expandedobj_incakir.jpg){width=90%}
Figure 3. x - An object shared between different activity systems

<!-- Also [@lecusay_telementoring_2015] - justifiying examining joint object as  system in itself.  -->

This conception incorporates the importance of the roles of researchers and other stakeholders within this interventionist and participatory processes. The need to analyse activity through its transformation through contradictions of tensions of systems elements, drawn from Marxist conceptions of dialectics forms the base of the concepts of expansive learning. In 3GAT the this view of transformation via joint work between activity systems on a new expanded object is called expansive learning [@engestrom_design_2011].

<!-- "Expansive learning leads to the formation of a new, expanded object and pattern of activity oriented to the object. This process, known as ascending from the abstract to the concrete, involves the formation of a theoretical concept of the new activity, based on grasping and modeling the initial simple relationship, the “germ cell,” that gives rise to the new activity and generates its diverse concrete manifestations Davydov 1990."" -->


<!-- #### The value of surfacing areas of contradictions (dialectics) -->

Drawing on concepts of tensions and contradictions existing in foundational concepts of dialectal materialism, the 3GAT allows for a granular exploration of tensions and contradictions are a vital source of change and evolution of new and ongoing activity systems [@engestrom_expansive_2001]. 3GAT achieves this via careful of description, analysis, and representation of system elements, interaction between systems and resulting  contradictions. Tensions between participant motives and different parts of activity system are sometimes revolved quickly through change, or remain more persistent and can be referred to as conflicts [@sannino_cultural-historical_2018]. These unresolved contradictions develop into impasses or conflicts which may serve as motivational factors driving agentic responses from participants in dysfunctional systems. A later section explores Sannino's view of such conflicts positively as the source of transformative agency in greater depth.

Kamanga notes the value of locating system congruencies or strengths within activity systems [@kamanga_contradictions_2021]. For a comprehensive analysis of systemic contradictions see the work of Engeström and Cakir [-@cakir_contradictions_2022; -@engestrom_discursive_2011]. While I agree with the potential value of precise use of the terms tensions and contractions [@karanasios_exploring_2017], in this study rather than larger systems of workplace analysis happening over years, analysis of tensions takes place in the context of shorter interventions as seen in  diverse research [@barab_developing_2002; @barab_using_2002; @lewin_developing_2018]. As such longer terms conflicts are less likely to occur, and the concrete description of contradictions are helpful in themselves as a source of disambiguation. Therefore, following Kuuti [-@kuutti_activity_1995], this study adopts contradictions as a term encompassing concepts of tensions, barriers and conflicts. Engeström states such sub-terms can be "understood as manifestations of contradictions" [@engestrom_discursive_2011, p.340]. I use more specific terms are used when needed to disambiguate meaning.

<!-- In the following chapters I focus on tensions which help explore the research questions and which help inform the findings of later chapters. In particular I draw out more visible conflicts which threaten more serious disruption of activities. -->

<!-- ##### Disambiguating terminology - Conflicts, tensions, contradictions, dilemmas - CHAT, AT and 3GAT -->
<!-- Even within schools of CHAT, terms are not set. To avoid the dangers of the vague use of the terms tensions and contractions [@karanasios_exploring_2017], this section outlines my interpretation based on the scope of this study.    -->
<!-- Instrumental agency is relevant here to help examine and the work of learning designers to remove  barriers, Transformational and authorial agency serves to explore the potential for learners to address and overcome tensions and conflicts in their own way. -->
<!-- (Relational agency?) -->

### Applying 3GAT via formative interventions

The term formative intervention (FI) has its roots in  Cole and Engeström's exploration of two models of CHAT based interventionist research [@valsiner_cultural-historical_2007]. While both interventions, namely Change Laboratory (from Helsinki school) and 5th Dimension (Cole's intervention carried out in partnership with wider sociocultural researchers), were designed to align with principles of AT, and termed formative interventions in early publications, it is Engeström who has used the term most consistently and who has defended against it being used more flexibly [@engestrom_methodological_2014]. In this section I explore the Helsinki school's narrower interpretation of formative interventions as an application of 3GAT theory. In the following section I turn to wider applications of interventionist approaches.

A model of formative intervention that has been addressed by much research is Engeström's implementation of expansive learning in workplace environments, a set of processes applied in a workplace setting called Change Laboratory (CL) [@engestrom_putting_2007].

The CL interventions takes the form of a series of workshops with stakeholders important in the workplace setting with the researchers act as facilitators of the process. The structural model of 3GAT is used as a tool to identify, analyse and provoke reflection on current workplace practices and dynamics and to facilitate discussion on possible actions to enact change. The CL processes suits a formal, relatively stable workplace where there are existing concepts of community, division of labour and existing norms are readily identifies.

Another form of FI relevant to this study is that of the Learning Lab which is represented above in Fig.3.x  [@cakir_contradictions_2022; @bal2011culturally].  While Learning Lab takes place in a context of a school environment, interventions retain the form of stakeholder workshops. For more on formative interventions have taken other forms that have been used or endorsed by Engeström's team in Helsinki team see [@engestrom_expansive_2022].

Cole and Engeström's exploration of two models of formative interventions [@valsiner_cultural-historical_2007] concludes that while the methodology aligns with key principles of AT, there are practical changes in aligning with perceived rigour of social science given the changing environmental factors and lack of standardised tests. It also notes issues of financing such lengthy and repeated interventions in the experimental process and the challenge the status quo, and thus those that might fund such research, by developing the agency of workers and learners.

Cole notes the need to align research interventions with the ongoing aims of educational or community parters to maximise their ongoing sustainability beyond research period [@valsiner_cultural-historical_2007; @cole_fifth_2006]. To illustrate this point he describes a model of formative intervention in the form of an after school programme called the 5th Dimension. In a following section, this case study is used as a starting point for a comparison of different approaches to interventions based on CHAT.  Penuel [-@penuel_emerging_2014] proposes the formative intervention research as a useful term to encapsulate a variation of process closely aligned with CHAT including those drawing on elements of DBR. In reply, Engeström resists this proposition, insisting that formative interventions should contain a clear articulation of _double stimulation_ and the process of _rising to the concrete_ within the framework of Engeström and Sannino's understanding of these concepts [@sannino_formative_2016; @engestrom_methodological_2014; @engestrom_discursive_2011]. The following section addresses these concerns.


<!-- #### Rising to the Concrete -->

The concept of rising the the concrete via a germ cell of activity (or unit of analysis) can be traced through the work of Vygotsky and Leontiev to Hegelian and Marxist concepts of holistic understandings of phenomena [@blunden_activity_2023]. Varied forms of activity are conceived as concreted instances and iterations of underlying germ cell concepts, which exist as an abstracted form. For example, Marx's analysis of a complex capitalist system was based on a more simple germ cell of commodity exchange in pre-industrial economies. The works of Blunden and Davydov [@blunden_interdisciplinary_2010; @blunden_germ_2014; @blunden_activity_2023; @davydov_problems_2008] provide as comprehensive justification the utility of the process of finding a germ cell/ unit of analysis in relation to collaborative and learning projects. Blunden describes the germ cell of activity and the unit of activity as two similar concepts with slightly different foci.

<!-- Mid-level construct of design / patterns heuristics [] -->

    ... the germ-cell and the unit of analysis are one and the same thing, but in one case the developmental aspect is emphasised and in the other case the analytical aspect is emphasised. [@blunden_unit_2020]

In this thesis, my role as both researcher and practitioner, make both aspects are relevant. Examining the analytical aspect, the process of seeking and defining a key activity scopes as units for analysis helps define boundaries of what to analyse in depth. A challenge of the application of this approach, is the duration and relative stability needed taken to identify these germ cell. In their critique of Penuel Engestrom and Sannino [@engestrom_methodological_2014] give no suggestion on adapting their models to more rapidly changing situations where actors from different activity systems.

<!-- In Chapters 5 and 6 I outline how the process of developing activities for the community of learners is also -->

<!-- It appears valid to question how applicable is Engeström application of this concepts to all research based on AT, given the consistency of application in AT papers,
 -->
<!-- #### Double stimulation (DS)   -->

<!-- While the core concept stems from object based psychological experiments, the "extension of this idea to collective behaviour with adults indicates how the basic logic of the method can be extended as a tool of intervention research". [@valsiner_cultural-historical_2007, p.492].   -->

<!-- Engeström's initial description of DS, which does appear to be a series on introduced meditational stimuli evolves based on initial research.  -->

Double stimulation refers to a process in the use of tools  to overcome contradictions that emerge in joint activity. Engeström's early work on formative interventions frames   the first stimulus as _the problem itself_ and a potential series of secondary stimuli be presented as part of intervention [@valsiner_cultural-historical_2007, p.492]. Engeström and Sannino describe that the process is active and goes beyond simple mediation via existing tools, as the  stimuli, either presented as suggested tools or discovered in the environment, are actively imbued with meaning by the participants through transformation [@engestrom_methodological_2014].  

    "Most likely the initially given potential second stimuli are rejected or reshaped by the participants, and the participants typically pick up or invent devices of their own, often as if behind the back of the interventionist." [@engestrom_methodological_2014, p.121]


<!-- This research depicts wider constellations of activity systems working together on shared project [@cakir_contradictions_2022]. -->

<!-- Thus Sannino cautions 'double stimulation cannot be subsumed to the general idea of mediation by symbolic tools' [-@sannino_principle_2015, p.2], -->

For example, the Change Laboratory model, the first stimulus would be _mirror data_ from ethnographic video recordings which locate a problem to address. The second stimulus (more accurately a series of stimuli) are the use of techniques to provoke, shape, record and reflect on the emerging discussion [@engestrom_putting_2007]. Sannino's [@sannino_principle_2015] work on the volitional aspect of the process of double stimulation see auxiliary stimulation as triggers for will and agency in participants. [@hopwood2023motives] is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

<!-- In research on the use of wiki technology by students Lund and Ramussen [-@lund_right_2008-1] caution against mismatches between the first and second stimulus; interpreting project tasks or objectives as the first stimuli, and the tools used to the as secondary stimuli. They also outline the importance of awareness of the likelihood of multiple stimuli in modern technical working environments. -->

Another to  intervene in kindergarten educational process and organising structure [@rajala_utopian_2023].

<!-- The focus there, as with Cole's work is on the emergence of culture, tracing the historicity of it, and on equity in the process. -->

## Theoretical concepts used in the Fifth Dimension, a formative intervention drawing on broader sociocultural concepts

A strand of activity theory perhaps best typified by the pioneering work of Michael Cole and colleagues in the Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC). While a full exploration of the themes of this work are beyond the remit of this chapter (see [@cole_mind_1997] for a summary), this section focuses on some of the key concepts with a focus on the development and analysis of culture via a joint activity [@valsiner_cultural-historical_2007].  

Explore of Cole's approach in this area, is often profitably explored using case study of a series of after-school interventions known as the Fifth Dimension. The focus of the programme was on sustainability, mutuality and a utopian ideal of creating a new activity system shielded from some of the more debilitating contexts of mainstream school and wider societal forces [@blunden_formative_2023]. The following theoretical concepts, beneficial to this thesis,  have been created or employed by varied researchers associated with LCHC. These concepts are mutual appropriation, third spaces, idiocultures, funds of knowledge and communities of learners.

<!-- Here describing the  approach to culture as hybrid of American anthropological approaches and those of USSR researchers. -->
#### Mutual appropriation in 5D

The setting of the 5D was in community partners after-school clubs, with guiding direction from university researchers and additional support from undergraduate student volunteers. The main activity was playful tasks with the goal of fun and  building literacy. The concept of mutual appropriation has been used by Cole to explain and explore the process of the development of the practicalities and structure of the research programme. Cole noted that for an activity to be sustainable the goal of researchers, student volunteers, and  funders and those of the local partners needed, as much as possible, to align [@cole_fifth_2006]. To achieve this, Cole and colleagues describes a mutual process of adaptation of joint activities between institutions which server not only to reform actvities to be suitable for ongoing partnership, but also leave a historical trace of evolving activity serve as a profitable base for cultural analysis [@downing-wilson_design_2011]. The authors note here a distinction between the 5D approach and Change Lab is the early stage of the intervention where activity goals are not year formed and are still in a state of evolution. I return to this point later in this chapter.     

#### Third spaces, idiocultures and funds of knowledge

<!-- Cole's approach can be examined using the 5D case study (later?) -->

Cole describes the values of researchers being involved in early evolution of interventions in their observations in adaptations of the 5D programme based on the culture of the host partners and young participants. Following Fine [@fine_boys_1987], Cole uses the term _idioculture_ [@cole_fifth_2006, p.32] to highlight the evolution of a novel, micro culture within the 5D programme. In line with Downing-Wilson [-@downing_wilson_sociogenesis_2011], novel idiocultures are not created from nothing but encompass the traits of the diverse cultural systems of stakeholders [@cole_idiocultural_2017].  Cole describes the utility of the concepts of idiocultures as a concrete ways of studying the dynamics cultural variability between the different sites and as a practical way to shape the activities of the programme based on the previous experiences of participants [@cole_idiocultural_2017].  

This interpretation of the practical utility of idiocultures resonates with the concept of third spaces and fund of knowledge. Funds of knowledge (FoK), a term popularised by one of the research partners of the 5D, Luis Moll [@moll_funds_1992], locates home discourses and practices as a resource that can be drawn on as a resource by teachers and participants to facilitate learning in school or other environments to achieve more equitable and inclusive learning experiences. The approach is particularly valuable for learners whose home life is culturally relatively distant from school discourses. Moje and colleagues [@moje_working_2004] explore the use of FoK in the context of interventions outside of school, aiming to develop content literacy. The process of blending the knowledge and discourses of first space (home life) with the motivations of the second space (school or institution) into a new _third space_ has been explored in various studies [@moje_working_2004; @gutierrez_developing_2008; @gutierrez_developing_2008; @bryant_academic_2009].

Rajala and colleagues [@rajala_utopian_2023] problematise the use of FoK in third spaces.  They critiques a superficial use of FoK which may perpetuate cultural stereo types and thus the existing negatively status quo  [@rajala_utopian_2023]. Additionally, the practical issue of gathering enough relevant data on home cultures to inform a more nuanced use of FOK would be very time consuming. To address these issues the advance a concept of funds of identity, which is allows an exploration of home cultures within the scope of the intervention through the creation of _identity artefacts_ with participants [@subero_mediation_2018].

<!-- The work problematises the possible superficial use of FoK and FoI in a ways which may perpetuate status quo negatively [@rajala_utopian_2023] -->


The work of Rogoff and Gutiérrez on
_linguistic and cultural-historical repertoires_ [@rogoff_cultural_2003] also aims to avoid cultural-historical practices of participation being misrepresented as innate practices, a practice they cite as particularly problematic in dimensions of race. They emphasise that both educators and researchers should avoid design based on assumed _traits_ of learners, instead researching and then checking existing repertoires of practice that may be incorporated and then extended within joint work. This work draws on Rogoff's pioneering work addressing analysis of complex group activities using three planes of observation, namely personal, social and community activity.  A key motivation driving analysis of behaviours on a social plane is Rogoff's desire to transcend the dichotomy of learner-led verses teacher-led approaches [@rogoff_childrens_1993; @mascolo_beyond_2009]. The concepts of guided participation and, as a middle ground between instruction and discovery, and the role of emerging repertoires of practice within that process are explored in more detail in Chapter 6.

<!-- The development of the cultural repertoires in group work  continues of the work of Gutiérrez on social design
experiments [@gutierrez_social_2016-1; @gutierrez_social_2020]. -->

<!-- While the author's original research was on indigenous cultural practices on a village level, the model has been applied in both formal and informal educational settings.

For example, in a primary school setting, Morcom [@morcom_scaffolding_2014] applies Rogoff's  [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of activity to help understand the development of classroom activity. In this interpretation, teachers design learning environments and interventions to support learners to enter into a pattern of activity, in this case focusing on those beneficial to student's positive affect. -->

## Putting AT to work, variations in interventionist CHAT research

Whereas there is broad agreement in the theoretical understandings of concepts of activity theory carried out by differing schools of researchers, there is more disparity in the way they are applied in a research settings.

<!-- In line with the overall importance of context above, this section continues to explore the application theoretical partly as a product of geographically separate schools of research, with differing contextual forces operating on them. The intention here is not to create a history of these schools, which I am not qualified to do, it is rather to use the differing contexts as way of exposing synergies and fault lines in their approaches which are relevant to this thesis. -->

One way of exporing variations and fault-lines between approaches which are relevant to this thesis is to compare interpretations of CHAT interventions with variants of design experimentation, design research, or design-based research (which I will henceforth call DBR).

<!-- Notable synergies include; the value of interventionist approaches, a focus on utility of research, and  ??

Emerging fault lines include; attitudes towards design based research, variations in initial genesis of interventions and the mutuality of that process,   -->


The process of comparing FI and DBR is complicated by DBR's wide application and its diverse interpretations beyond some generally agreed principles [@penuel_emerging_2014; @mckenney_educational_2021]. Easterday characterises the core elements of DBR as: research as an form intervention, iteration, involvement of participants in the evolution of designs, and a flexibility of research outcome based on how events unfold [@easterday_design-based_2014]. Cobb and colleagues summarise the characteristics of design based approaches as "extended (iterative), interventionist (innovative and design-based), and theory-oriented enterprises whose 'theories' do real work in practical educational contexts" [@cobb_design_2003, p.13]. For more detailed definitions of DBR see Sandoval [-@sandoval_conjecture_2014] Hay [-@hay_constructivism_2001, p. 3]

While the broad approaches are in alignment with CHAT approaches, Penuel [-@penuel_emerging_2014], in an attempt to summarise differences between DBR and CHAT interventions talks of the focus of DBR by learning scientists and advancing practice and theory related to innovative learning tasks, while CHAT interventions are more focused on transformations in activity and the increasing agency of those involved. Engeström [@engestrom_design_2011] outlined the following criticisms of DBR when compared to CHAT when applied to education: vague in description of systemic elements in analysis, overly focused on a linear approach to refining the researcher's learning design in a way that limits the input and agency of  participants. O'Neill [-@oneill_understanding_2016] echoes some of these concerns and develops them to encourage fellow DBR researchers to applied CHAT methodology to addressed limitations in existing DBR practice in the learning sciences community. He highlights that DBR researchers in this field do not always take time to familiarise themselves with existing learning practices of the contexts in which they study in a way which aligns with CHAT approaches.   

Bakker [@bakker_design_2018] challenges Engeström's critique of the closed goals of DBR as outlined in his critique of the work of Collins and colleagues [@collins_design_2004] as a caricature which misrepresented their work stating they did "not want to fix variables or educational goals upfront" [@bakker_design_2018, p.17]. Bakker echoes the call of a Penuel, Cole, and O’Neill for more dialogue and greater acknowledgement of the shared traditions of CHAT and design research [@cole_cultural-historical_2018]. Penuel [-@penuel_emerging_2014] describes design based researchers as an appropriately eclectic in methodical as a way of flexibly responding to context. Bakker also sees this flexibility as a strength of the discipline, and resists calls for more formalisation of the design process [@ormel_researchpractice_2012; @mckenney_systematic_2013].  



<!-- Penuel [-@penuel_emerging_2014]
For example, learning scientists today employ design experiments primarily to develop theory related to how children learn disciplinary core ideas by engaging with innovative curricular tasks, often supported by technology (e.g., Cobb, Confrey, diSessa, Lehrer, & Schauble, 2003; Design-Based Research Collective, 2003; Kelly, Lesh, & Baek, 2008; Sandoval, 2013). By contrast, CHAT intervention research focuses on transforming activity and expanding the agency of participants -->

<!-- Penuel [-@penuel_emerging_2014] charts a shared foundations and of AT and wider research intervention in education including DBR and proposes greater dialogue between CHAT and DBR researchers on alignment of processes.

This stance was taken in response to Engeström's critique of design experiments and DBR more widely [@engestrom_design_2011]. It is of value to explore this debate to highlight similarities and differences.

<!-- Penuel [-@penuel_emerging_2014] notes a difference in focus with DBR focusing on developing and innovative curricular tasks with technological aspects rather than broader concerns of participant agency. -->

<!-- Hay describes DBR thus "learning occurs within a context of use, learning is frequently collaborative, learning as authentic, learning as inquiry-based not transmission-based" [@hay_constructivism_2001, p. 3].

Sandoval notes diverse methods at use [-@sandoval_conjecture_2014], but notes the alignment of approaches within DBR namely, "the joint pursuit of practical improvement and theoretical refinement; cycles of design, enactment, analysis, and revision; and attempts to link processes of enactment to outcomes of interest". -->

### Challenges and resolutions in the intersection of DBR and CHAT interventions

Engeström's view of DBR [@engestrom_learning_2009] is that it lacks rigorous examination of the dynamic nature of context with CHAT conceptions of Activity. O'Neill offers contextual factors which help explain this deficit, including the pressures on researchers using DBR [@oneill_understanding_2016]. The depth of analysis of context may provide challenging given the convention time frame for funding windows in the field of learning sciences, and a common focus from funders to demonstrate positive impact of research interventions. It is of note that the formal approach of formative interventions is often used in stable institutional systems of work environments in European contexts where there are more stable understandings of stakeholders involved compared to less formal learning environments [@spinuzzi_trying_2020-1].

<!-- O'Neill [-@oneill_understanding_2016] also outlines The causes of this state of affairs. In particular, he outlines the myth of the heroic researcher/ designer who drives change and updates the proposed learning design in the face of adversity stems from a need to report successes within the time span of research funding awards. -->

Spinuzzi [-@spinuzzi_trying_2020-1] notes an incompatibility with contexts involving unstable stakeholders and rapidly evolving contexts as a critique of 3GAT and formative interventions. Given these factors, we can ask is a formative intervention overly complex and prescriptive for either a narrower focus of a learning design. While there are many theoretical proposals to address these aspects via a 4GAT, there is no corresponding update of FI models like Change Laboratory.

Indeed it seems there in now greater consensus that, there is value to bring more cultural historical and concepts into existing DBR approaches. By way of illustration, Engeström, Sannino and colleagues in recent work [-@cakir_contradictions_2022] appear to take a more collegiate approach position in regards to DBR, rather that critiquing it wholesale.

    "Formative interventions can contribute to the new generation of DBR by providing a robust theory and methodology for systemic transformation, collective agency, and expansive learning". [@cakir_contradictions_2022]


This study, which aims to CHAT principles to a novel learning context of relative instability, is a potentially helpful case study in this endeavour.

<!-- "In CHAT/DBR, innovations for learning are ideally historicized, meaning that the designs leverage recognized practices in partner communities. At the risk of stating the obvious, historicizing design in this way demands a degree of knowledge of and legitimacy within the partner community that design-based researchers in the learning sciences/DBR tradition do not always take time to develop."  [@oneill_understanding_2016, p.499] -->


#### Theoretical concepts of DBR used in this study

This section outlines some concepts from DBR which I draw on in later chapters.


**Design narratives**

To address aspects of utility and replication of research and some of the challenges of representation in research outputs that Bakker cites, may be addresssed via the form of a design narrative [@hoadley_creating_2002-1]. The concept of design narrative emerged within DBR as a way to communicate the important detail of context and detail of the emerging learning design [@hoadley_creating_2002-1; @brase_knowledge_2024; @bell_theoretical_2004]. I propose, that the increasing alignment of DBR and CHAT interventions, may be augmented in part through the use of design narratives [@brase_knowledge_2024] with systemic and analytical concepts provided by activity theory. For an example for such a design narrative using CHAT terms see the case study of in Cole and colleagues book on Fifth Dimension [@cole_fifth_2006].  

While this approach may help address the more general bias of reviewers of journals is noted by Bakker [@bakker_design_2018] the logistical problems fitting in the description of design process with the restriction. The format of this PhD thesis at least allows for a full exploration in Chapter 5.  


**Rapid iteration of learning resources**

One of the key motivations of DBR approach is to produce educational research that has a high utility for practitioners through developing theory that is rooted in contextual practice and which can produce new pedagogies and resources [@cobb_design_2003].  

The rapid change of learning materials based on quick feedback suits this development of a novel learning design.





<!-- The next sections address this with relevant concepts. -->
<!-- **Germ cell and analysis**
RQ2 of this thesis addresses the potential role of game design patterns (GDPs) as a guiding process in varied forms.

While this concept of germ cell / unit of analysis is typically used in a larger scope of activity, the principles apply this smaller scope. While game making can as an overarching activity system, a narrower activity whose objective is implementing GDPs became a significant unit of activity for this study. The justification for this is explored in more depth in Ch.4

Later in Ch. 6 I employ a narrow focus on the implementation of gameplay design patterns (GDPs) allowing for the identification and analysis of patterns of participant behaviour and introduced and emerging community practices to do with GDPs. -->


## Concepts of agency within CHAT


To effectively address Research Question 2, which asks how participants develop agency in an evolving community of game makers, it is vital to clarify the concept of agency, particularly in the context of learning environments

The question of who or what has agency is a philosophical one with practical applications in designing learning settings. Agency and autonomy are often either vaguely defined or have contested, interconnected definitions in studies [@huang_autonomy_2013; @matusov_mapping_2016]. For this thesis, in line with a cultural-historical approach, agency is viewed as a cultural phenomenon experienced by individuals in relation to their peers and their learning environment. To situate this view within the varied and evolving concepts of agency in educational settings, I draw on the work of Matusov and colleagues [@matusov_mapping_2016]who categorise agency into several genres: instrumental agency focused on developing capacities, effortful agency related to motivation and commitment, dynamically emergent agency involving affordances and actor-network theory, and authorial agency, which entails agentic changes to the learning environment. Given Matusov and colleagues’ critique of effortful agency in education, which primarily focuses on achieving goals predefined by educational institutions, this summary instead emphasises an analysis of instrumental, dynamically emergent, and authorial agency within the framework of Activity Theory. These forms of agency offer a broader perspective, including an exploration of how individuals navigate and transform their learning environments, extending beyond merely fulfilling institutionally set objectives.

<!-- See also affordences in hci [@kaptelinin_affordances_2012] -->

<!-- ### Addressing and disambiguating definitions of agency in education -->


<!-- Engeström and Sannino see this slipperiness as a deficit in understanding of the underlying mechanism [@engestrom_methodological_2014]. -->
<!-- See also feminist reconceptualisations of autonomy as agency[@abrams_autonomy_1998]. -->

### Instrumental and relational agency

Instrumental agency reflects a concept of agency as the ability to get things done, thus, a view of agency as a set of capacities [@edwards_steps_2005]. Matusov and colleagues highlights an often technological view of educational environments where educators seek to increase instrumental agency by building the individual capacity of learners to achieve relevant tasks [@matusov_mapping_2016]. Many DBR studies which aim to develop and study the use of new tools especially in the area of education technology, would aim to increase instrumental learner agency, designing away problems. Explored within a CHAT framework this type of agency can also be understood as increasing fluidity of practice (operationalisation) using objects and people as tools within mediated activity.

Edwards' concept of relational agency is framed as an extension to the concept of instrumental agency to include a more social dimension where leaners are able to offer and request support [@edwards_steps_2005].  While this view of relational, instrumental agency in an school setting is laudable, Edwards [-@edwards_steps_2005] notes it is often restricted by curricular and institutional norms.  

### Dynamically emergent agency

Matusov and colleagues' interpretation of a dynamically emergent dimension of agency is complex and diverse allowing agency to be recognised in distributed forms such as 'emerging collective agency, agency of bureaucracy, non-human agency of animals, agency of distributed machine-human network, agency of Internet, and so on' [@matusov_mapping_2016, p. 432]. The authours recognise the value of this framing of agency to explore and address constraints and designing support in the form of affordances in the learning environment. As this study involves the use of computer systems to learn computer coding, it is of value Affordances are well  of human computer interaction (HCI), there is value in exploring agency in this context. Work by Bærentsen and Trettvik [@ba_erentsen_activity_2002] linking the use of affordances in HCI to a foundation in activity theory highlights, following Gibson [@gibson2014theory], that affordances exist as opportunities provided by the environment and objects within it, either natural or culturally created, to organisms within that environment. The authors also note that the distinction between the intended (designed) use of affordances and their possible use, an important distinction in the field of HCI, is one best explored via activity theory's study of the interaction of humans and artefacts as joint activity, thus preventing the view that that affordances have magical powers outside of a cultural context.

The work of Nardi and Kaptelinin is also helpful here to examine the concept of designed affordance in learning environments through a lens of activity theory [@kaptelinin_activity_2012]. The authours also regrounding Gibson's concept of affordances as  possibilities in line with activity theory concepts of mediated action [@kaptelinin_affordances_2012]. They situate the creation of affordances in designed systems as a form of delegated agency [@kaptelinin_activity_2012]. Artefacts or tools used in mediated activity may be given a form of delegated agency through designed affordances, e.g a phone may prompt its user to charge its battery via notifications. However, unlike Latour's [@lemonnier_ethnography_2013] concept of agency in actor network theory, objects would not delegate agency to a human [@kaptelinin_activity_2012, p.42]. This is not to say that non-human objects have no impact on others as once the artefacts are placed in context may have unintended consequences creating what Engeström calls _runaway objects_ [@spinuzzi_losing_2011]. Thus not withstanding, the original volition or motivations stem from human-initiated activity. The following section on authorial concept of agency is not experienced as delegated but rather created.



<!-- For the purposes of this study, I agree with the view that the nature of agency as situated in context. Thus we do not say learners have or lack agency, as it is not a learner property independent of context  [@nieminen_what_2022]. -->

<!-- There is a link between double stimulation and affordances [@romero_analysing_2022] -->
<!-- A good summary of affordances related to HCI is here [@galliers_affordance_2017] -->
<!-- Other researchers have found the the scope and focus of affordances important to clarify [@wolff-piggott_activity_2016-1]. -->


### Authorial and transformative agency

Matusov proposes authorial agency [@matusov_mapping_2016] as the concept of agency, as the most active and best aligned with an ideal form of education, in doing so drawing on existing work from CHAT researchers on and transformational concepts of agency. This section focuses on the work on Stetsenko in the form of transformative activist stance (TAS) [@martin_theory_2015; @stetsenko2014transfromative] and Sannino in the form of TADS [@sannino_transformative_2022]

####  Transformative activist stance TAS

While there is a wealth of research  which discusses and applies concepts of affordances and dynamic agency, often in the field of HCI, the focus is often skewed towards individual rather than on collective action [@kaptelinin_affordances_2012]. Additionally, while Stetsenko's [@stetsenko2020radical] critique of relational approaches to agency, both outside and within CHAT circles, invites us to resist the marginalisation of the role of the individual. Stetsenko critiques both conceptions of human agency an individual attribute or a negation of human agency which views individuals as helpless bodies in wider cultural phenomenon [@stetsenko_critical_2020; @matusov_mapping_2016]. Instead, agency involves both contextual tensions and human volition. Thus, Stetsenko proposes a transformative activist stance (TAS) to  address the societal urgency of agency with a direct focus on political dimensions. For Stetsenko the stakes are high given ecological and military crises caused by late stage capitalism, but there is still everything to play for [@hall_marxism_2023]. Thus, Stetsenko advocates a _flagrantly partisan_ approach for researchers, as a reaction to a perceived pose of neutrality or distancing present post-modern and post-human approaches [@stetsenko_hope_2020; @stetsenko_critical_2020].

While the overall focus being societal change, TAS has been applied to smaller scale concrete explorations, including play [@stetsenko_serious_2015], transformation in a group home for adolescents [@vianna_connecting_2011] (MORE?). The second example in group home used a case study of an individual to gain an in-depth picture of transformations concerning identity and learning contexts. In TAS aspects of conceptual understandings of agency and specifics of methodology are less explored than the motivational dimensions. While the urgent call to research community for partisan involvement is not accompanied by suggested means to undertake this process, the method of auto-ethnography is used in several studies [@vianna_connecting_2011].   

Thus TADS stands in contradiction to TADS within formative interventions which is presented together with Change Laboratory as a suggested methodology.

#### Transformation agency through double stimulation (TADS) - On double stimulation and agency

The Helsinki school's focus on transformative agency also advocates the importance of intervention and transformation as a desirable aspect of research, [@engestrom2006development; @haapasaari_emergence_2016; @sannino_formative_2016]. The vehicle for this in recent years has been the concept of transformation agency through double stimulation (TADS). Similarly to TAS, the objective of TADS is increased agency of participants in research interventions. In addition, TADs researchers articulate a desire to understand a broad picture of agency from a CHAT perspective. As outlined above double stimulation describes additional stimuli beyond the first stimulus understood as the motivation of the activity. In the Change Lab (CL) interventions for example, the active use of secondary stimulus can both analyse and facilitate agency by provoking reflection [@sannino_principle_2015].

Studies of transformative agency, for example within CL, often involve a significant longitudinal aspect. However, the TADS concepts has been applied in research over much shorter time frames and in more naturalistic settings such as hospital practice [@hopwood_forward_2022; @hopwood_volitional_2022], higher education [@grant_double_2022], and digital education [@aagaard_teacher_2022]. The concept of volitional action by subjects as a foundation for transformation is used in these shorter term studies to explore the processes of decision forming and implementation [@virkkunen_dilemmas_2006; @sannino_double_2015]. Here the secondary stimuli are used by participants as a spur and then as leverage in volitional acts. To address this aspect, Sannino augments the concept of transformative agency by double stimulation (TADS) with a metaphor of a sea vessel warping using kedging anchors.

    We may think of the second stimulus as an anchor. Anchors are commonly understood as stabilising devices to prevent a vessel from moving. However, not all anchors have this function. Beside the heavy-weight anchors, there are also kedge anchors serving the purpose of ‘warping,’ that is, pulling the anchor once it has settled on the ground, for moving the vessel away from a problem area. [@sannino_transformative_2022, p. 4]

This metaphor highlights the active effort of participants to overcome tensions and dilemmas in their activities, which can leave them stuck, much like being stranded on a sandbank. In an educational intervention, learners might "throw a kedge anchor" into the learning environment, symbolizing an intentional action to pull themselves out of the impasse they are facing.

While not all attempts, such as directly asking a peer or teacher for help, will succeed, some will take hold and lead to transformation for the student. This may also trigger a broader shift in the educational environment itself. This idea is particularly relevant to the setting of this study, where the learning environment is co-created by both participants and researchers.

<!-- By contrast the work on  idioculture by Cole and colleagues explores this more actively via design narratives and similar techniques. -->

## Conclusion / Synthesis.

In this chapter I have outlined the foundational concepts and current strands of interest of CHAT and explored how the field is becoming increasing aligned with that of design-based research. The complementary elements identified can be operationalised by utilising both CHAT's comprehensive framework for understanding human activity and DBR's practical focus on more rapidly iterative cycles of designed interventions.

To situate the learner at this stage, concept related to activity systems approach explored in this chapter are briefly outlined in the context of this study. The figure below represent a broader picture of the activity within the context of other activity systems as seen in the work of Cakir and colleagues represened above in Fig 3.  [@cakir_contradictions_2022].

![](./Pictures/At_dia_3_v3.png){width=90%}
Fig 3.x - environmental positioning with game making activity mediating the interactions between stakeholders.

The representation above allows for a conception that funds of knowledge and existing repertoires of communication from the activity systems of different stakeholders and learning contribution to the new, emerging system. Following an approach taken by Lecusay [-@lecusay_telementoring_2015], the processes at work in the emerging shared object are extensive enough merits examination as activity system in their own rights from the point of view of the game making community as a whole (including facilitators) as a subject, and from a narrower scope of an individual or pair subject. These systems are outlined in more depth in in chapter five. At this stage, it is of value to briefly explore the object of the activity, while the complexity of understanding of the object of activity is fresh in our minds. In this study, in line with AT understandings, there is some expansion in terms of the scope and understanding of the object. While the object of activity for learners was to make a game, in early stages the learning process was experimental. As such, the main object shared by both family and university participants was to develop an effective pedagogy and working processes to allow the joint creation of games.

The hybrid of AT and DBR is particularly valuable for this study which involves the development of game coding abilities (IS THIS THE RIGHT TERM?), as it allows exploration of the contextual factors and influences from other activity systems contributing to the new shared object of activity. These include the ongoing development of cultural artefacts used, home interests and repertoires, as well as my own motivations. I am encouraged by the activist stance advocated by Stetsenko [@stetsenko_critical_2020], which rejects the abstraction of oneself from the processes participants engage in and promotes immersion in the struggle. This aligns with my own motivations in this study, resonating with my past experiences, as I position myself as an activist advocating for improved access to game-making through computer coding, a process currently hindered by educational contexts and classroom practices.

To achieve this, rather than following an established applied CHAT methodology like the Change Laboratory, I synthesise different concepts outlined in this chapter. The next chapter, which describes the methodology in more detail, will explain how I draw on CHAT, DBR, and Rogoff's concept of the three foci of analysis. In the analysis, I focus on the tensions between system elements, the iterative processes used to address these tensions, and transformational concepts of agency.

In chapter 4 particular attention is paid to the development of the artefacts and processes developed as part of the learning design as a form of evidence of these transformations. The more rapid iterations of design align to a greater extent to DBR process of than that of Change Laboratory, Despite this, this study does aim for a full application of a the stricter interpretation of the term formative intervention as outlined by Engeström and Sannino [-@engestrom_methodological_2014]. This hybrid approach address a key critique of the Helsinki school's implementation of third-generation activity theory (3GAT) via formative interventions such as the Change Laboratory, specifically that it is time-consuming and requires stable stakeholders [@spinuzzi_trying_2020-1]. However, while this hybrid process has proven fruitful in some areas, it has also posed challenges during the analysis stage. The implications of both successes and challenges are explored in the thesis conclusion.


Turning to a similar issue regarding conceptions of agency, TADS (transformative agency by double stimulation) is most commonly explored in relation to Change Laboratory and professional settings. Despite its potential in less structured contexts, there is a paucity of studies in the area of "student-centered contexts of learning"  [@isaac_cultural_2021, p. 93]. However, the broader concept of participants actively overcoming blockages caused by contradictions is well-explored in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and DBR. These fields often focus on revising educational tool designs to address conflicts, while still recognising the agency and input of participants [@karanasios_moving_2021] In line with Hopwood [@hopwood_agency_2022], I see significant potential in the application of TADS in varied, real-world learning environments, using a diverse range of in-situ data sources as learning practices evolve.

<!-- ADDRESS THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS HERE?  -->

To conclude this chapter, it is helpful to situate this synthesised theoretical framework as one that has the potential to make a valuable contribution through an applied case study. This case study aims to engage with current theoretical advances in the field of agency studies, particularly within the implementation of smaller-scale formative interventions. The framework outlined in this chapter informs the specific methodology described in the following chapter, where methods of data collection and stages of data analysis evolve in an iterative process, while remaining structured to incorporate the underlying concepts of CHAT and DBR.

##### Situating this study using third space and FoK terminology and processes

In the context of this study we can conceptualise the learning context as a third space mixing home learning and culture and the context of university research and outreach work.  

It draws on cultural processes of cultures of  family learning, coding cultures and informal science clubs. Of particular relevance is retro Gaming framed as a fund of identity. A process that emerged from early consultation with home educating families.

![](./Pictures/mine_craft_img.png){width=90%}

Retro gaming cultures emcompass broad media and practices beyond the games themselves. The image above shows now only a sketch of the Minecraft game, but also the names of YouTubers making videos about games.

<!-- Retro gaming and associated nostalgia can provoke a positive reaction from both parents and children. This can be used to leverage interest in creative projects. -->

This study positions this interest and identification as a fund of knowledge which designers should be aware of and utilise to help address some of the affective barriers to taking part in coding processes.

This study contributes to work which explores the potential does that give to developing game coding practices as per RQ3.

DROP CONTENT ON CHANGE LAB

One of the most striking set of practical techniques are those used in Engeström's take on Expansive Learning, specifically set of processes applied in a workplace setting called Change Laboratory (CL) [@engestrom_putting_2007]. The CL processes suits a formal workplace where there are existing concepts of Community and Division of Labour and Norms that have resulted in contradictions to be explored and resolved.
EXPAND THIS WITH EXAMPLES?

I am guided by the concepts behind the use of the models rather than drawn to an off the shelf application of CL processes or similar interventions. While some of the material used in CL and the fictional device of the 5D supports their primary tasks, others could be said to be support secondary considerations of navigating learning, establishing shared concepts and communities and reflecting on transformations in practices or understandings. These dimensions are sometimes explored in CHAT using the term of secondary stimuli used to facilitate and complement the primary task as part of the concept double stimulation.

In addition the concept of diversion from the primary task are relevant to the more playful approaches of participants and facilitators to make the learning process attractive [@engestrom_expansive_2013]. -->

From the perspective of participants, the goal of implementing individual game patterns rather than the overall goal of making of a game, took up the majority of their focus. This can be evidenced in the following observations;

- the frequency of GDP language referring to patterns used by pairs in particular in the process of collaborating on their games
- the utility of the smaller unit of analysis in aiding resource creation
- the value of completing something concrete a sense of sustaining achievement.
- the ability to reflect after implementing each sub project,

## Sections on DBR and AT



#### Principle : Researcher take and active interventionist approach

In both DBR and formative interventions, the researchers take an active role, a stance which has been critique from the perspective of traditional psychological experimental researchers CLARIFY.

Despite the generally agreed importance of context and the need to therefore intervene, some strands of DBR hold closer to the positivist approaches that DBR was initially conceived of to transcend [@brown_design_1992].



Learning environments are understood as designed systems with accumulated culture of tools and artefacts [@barnett_ecosystem_2019; @cole_design-based_2016]. Cobb and colleagues note a common goal of DBR in education is to study a new form of learning and that in order to do that naturalistic, existing learning environments may need to be disrupted [@cobb_design_2003].

While the process of intervention in a real learning context is present in broad interpretations of DBR [FIND SOURCES], when compared to CHAT there is debate surrounding the extent to which original designs should originate from researchers. Formative interventions running close to Engeström's model rarely work with entirely new design, favouring existing systems within relativelyDifferent  approaches are needed depending on if the activity and context of that activity is already  established an on-going or if it is a new venture created by researchers / participants. stable groups of stakeholders [@spinuzzi_trying_2020-1].

However, within DBR there is an understanding for the need for new interventions as the context may involve working in a new partnership or with new technology. Thus learning designers may need to start from a relatively blank canvas, as is the case in my study on game making, where there are little in the way of established community or working processes. Different  approaches are needed depending on if the activity and context of that activity is already established an on-going or if it is a new venture created by researchers / participants.

Engeström critiques the starting process of an introduced design stemming from the researcher rather than a community process [@engestrom_design_2011]. DBR however is more comfortable with new designs that are introduced fully by the researcher but with feedback from participants for ongoing iterations. To address issues of mutuality, early stages are often suggested to be rough prototypes which, so that if they are changed radically by participants, less time and resources are expended [@easterday_design-based_2014]. Issues of intervention lead to questions of mutuality in other ways.

<!-- This bears examination on two levels.
Firstly, it is of note that the formal approach of formative interventions is often used in stable institutional systems of work environments in European contexts where there are more stable understandings of stakeholders involved compared to less formal learning environments [@spinuzzi_trying_2020-1]. The author notes the impact of this context on they types of mutuality possible based on unstable stakeholders as a critique of 3GAT and formative interventions.

Secondly, it is out of date, see Penuel [-@penuel_emerging_2014] for an more updated take on alignment of formative interventions and DBR. More recently Engeström and colleagues [-@cakir_contradictions_2022] have advocated the advantages of incorporating more rigour of formative interventions to add to DBR, rather that critiquing it wholesale.   -->


#### Principle: Mutuality

Engeström critique of DBR for lack of mutuality within its _linear_ approach [@engestrom_design_2011] negates a wide uptake of concepts of mutuality in DBR. For example, the principle of DBR advanced by many researchers is that that research participants also influence the ongoing design of the research [@barab_critical_2004; @cobb_design_2003; @downing-wilson_design_2011].

Indeed the DBR and its link with participatory design provides a wealth of methods which invite participants to input into the design process. FIND HOW HOW.

<!--
From [@cakir_contradictions_2022]

In the last decade, learning scientists, psychologists, and education researchers using design-based research (DBR) engaged in a paradigm expansion and focused on research-community partnership in knowledge production and design activities (Bang & Vossoughi, 2016; Barajas-López and Ishimaru, 2020; Coburn & Penuel, 2016; Collins et al., 2018; Gutiérrez et al., 2020; Ishimaru et al., 2019; Zavala, 2016). The new generation of DBR studies typically involves multiple stakeholders, including researchers, practitioners, and other community members, as co-designers in developing possible new solutions for changing educational environments (Gutiérrez et al., 2020; Ishimaru et al., 2019; Penuel, 2020). Formative interventions can contribute to the new generation of DBR by providing a robust theory and methodology for systemic transformation, collective agency, and expansive learning (Bal, 2016; Bal et al., 2021; Gutiérrez & Penuel, 2014; O'Neill, 2016; Penuel, 2014; Rajala, 2019). -->

<!-- Comparing Engeström's focus of research with that of Cole surrounding the 5th Dimension is a valid approach to shed light on the emergent nature of the experiment and the similar setting of the study in an informal after-school environment. -->


#### Principle : Utility of research - overcoming the tension between the rich context and generalisation of results

Hoadley and Campos [@hoadley_design-based_2022] analyse DBR is also through the possible utility and outcomes of the research which the authors synthesise as including: design processes, domain theories, design principles or patterns, onological innovations, new hypothesis, and transformative learning of the researcher.

Barab and Squire [@barab_design-based_2004] describe the messiness of design-based research and that this creates a challenge to the researcher of how to present results in a coherent way which is of use to other practitioners. There is a tension between sticking closely to the context of the research and the concrete specifics or stepping back to generalise and being lost in abstraction.
