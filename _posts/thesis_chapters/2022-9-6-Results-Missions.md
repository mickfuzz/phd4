## Chapter introduction

<!-- The working title of this chapter is Missions which aligns with a strand of the 3M game making pedagogical model developed in the course of this study. -->

The purpose of this chapter is to explore how the data gathered informs thinking on two research questions of this study.  

- How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices by novices?
- How can the experience of fostering community focused digital game making practices inform wider practice in this area?

This section starts with a Vignette of parent child interaction in game making process. The vignette is used to introduce an overview of interpersonal interactions of that pair via analysis of video data.

<!-- DROP The activity of the focal pair is then compared to activity of other groupings and individuals. -->

The chapter then focuses on the use of game design patterns (GDPs) by participants in these interactions and then in reference to wider cultural and personal planes of activity.

The predominant analytical lens used in the chapter is that of interpersonal activity. Specifically in the form of guided participation in this game making community (Rogoff, )(explored previously).
ALTER - MERGE WITH BELOW

The working definition of GDPs explored in the literature review and enhanced in the design chapter is augmented with analysis of specific examples of their use by participants in practice.

## Introduction to This Writing

In the previous chapters we will have looked at the research landscape to develop coding and design practices in line with social understandings of learning. In particular, the intentional development of a communities of designers and coders with an educational aims has been explored paying particular attention strategies that educators can use to aid these processes. While this piece of writing contains results, it also contains references to concepts and methodologies which will be included in other chapters in the final thesis. Other emerging chapters are online at - https://mickfuzz.github.io/phd4/thesis_chapters.html
OR just create hyperlinks.

To help the reader understand the data in this chapter the following notes on methods/ methodology are included.

- The study uses mixed methods in methodology. Informed by analysis of journal diary, notes, video data and interviews (Methodology)
<!-- - An evolving table of what data is used in what way to answer each RQ is coming but is not ready. (Methodology) -->
- The research design evolved as the game making program was underway based on feedback and reactions of the participants (supported precedent in design-based research) (Methodology)
- A long pilot course and development stage resulted in extensive support materials and activities which I have structured into a learning design called 3M (Methodology + see recent chapter on 3M model)
- A narrow data samples has been used for this study. This prioritises a greater depth of analysis on interactions over generalisation. This is justified in a section on data validity in Methdology chpater.  
- The concepts of resolving tensions within activity from Activity Theory are used to explore the evolution of the design of activities and resources. (Design results)
<!-- - Rather than Engestroms AT framework (Subject, Object, Instruments, Rules, Community, Division of Labour) the results chapters use Rogoff's 3 planes of analysis (Cultural, Interpersonal and Personal) -->
- Results chapters use Rogoff's 3 planes of analysis (Cultural, Interpersonal and Personal) which aligns well with AT (Methodology)
- Game making is based on remixing code from an existing incomplete game template (half-baked games & scratch community processes)
<!-- - A quick summary of how parts of the design address three planes [is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FIPn2dEB2aCKZi5z05j69cnHgpGNXFh1_SPV6h5l12g/edit?usp=sharing) -->

### Recap on Game Design Patterns -

NOTE - A QUICK RECAP OF TERMS FROM LIT REVIEW

Design patterns are most commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing but they are also useful for all levels of learners. Design patterns are rooted in real-life incidences of problems that are often solved in a particular way. They are concrete examples of coding principles in context.

The term Game Design Patterns (GDP) use used in different ways. It can be used to describe the kind of code programming patterns that are used to structure code and keep it architecturally neat thus facilitating code sharing and extension. These patterns would be invisible to the end player of the game. The term also describes common patterns of game play and design that are visible to the player. Indeed players may become very familiar with these GDPs as they build their literacy as players about what they like or dislike about game they play. The results of this chapter focus on the second interpretation of GDPs.




Eriksson and friends [-@eriksson_using_2019] use the second interpretations. They  have described gameplay design patterns as a lingua franca for game developers. They have also compliled a list .. CITE

<!-- NOTE REMOVE THIS SECTION - THAT'S WHAT ALL OF THIS IS

<!-- From Eriksson article

Could move some of this to the results discussion -
"- Problem-Solving for Game Interaction Design: Patterns can contain various potential solutions for designers which have identified problems with specific interaction parts a game concept.
- Inspiration: Pattern collections embed gameplay concepts found useful in other games, and can therefore serve as a knowledge source for new game designs or redesigns of existing ones.
- Structured Design Tool: Both by enumerating concepts as individual patterns and by providing relations between patterns, a pattern collection can help designers to work through different levels of abstraction in a design in a structured fashion.
- Communication: The patterns offer the possibility to describe the design in a standardized format to make the understanding and comparison of different designs easier. This can be designers communicating with other designers but can also be participants discussing with other participants. The offering of a standardized format for concepts can potentially also increase the likelihood of members of heterogeneous groups being able to see each other as peers since they can communicate in a common way." -->

For the previous five minutes the parent and child dyad have face a blockage of a glitch in the software which prevents their wider objective of adding game design pattern of adding keys and doors to their game. In short, in this pattern the users must collect a key and then navigate to a door to progress to the next level. The parent Sh has been trying many different things and changing things in the code while the child Th has been expressing boredom. In response, Sh has expressed frustration and irritation. Finally Sh suggest that Th asks facilitator for help to resolve the coding glitch.

#### Summary Commentary on Annotation and Content of Vignette

The vignette including some gesture analysis. This is explore in more detail in a chapter on Methodolgy.

This was particularly valuable in the Key Door Person interchange where meaning was not clear before looking at video.
In previous chapter on methodology we (will) have examined the coding scheme used to code specifics on interactions and participant behaviour and output.

The resulting coding structure is available online here.

### Descriptive Commentary on Vignette A
<!-- ## WAS Observations of use of Game Design Patterns in Vignette A -->

<!-- NOTE - COULD AT 3RD GEN TERMS - COMMUNITY, RULES ETC BE USED FOR THIS ACTIVITY SYSTEM IN THIS COMMENTARY - TRY IT?
BUT WHY NOT 3 PLANES - THAT MAY BE BEST FOR CONSISTENCY - TRY ONE -->

In this section a summary of the interaction observed in the above vignette is described using three foci of activity. Where appropriate I make observations on similar patterns of behaviour from outside of this vignette.

**Cultural - Apprenticeship**

The parent has taken on the role of solving harder code problems and it engaging with the material being presented as part of the sessions and following the instructions carefully. The child is one of the younger participants and does not maintaining attention on the problem being solved. When blockages occur she is keener to explore the room or to dwell on the periphery of other participants interactions.

<!-- For both participants there is an explicit awareness of game making patterns and concept of the game as a dynamic system. Both seem to drive their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game. -->

Keys and Doors as a pattern or concept may have been something explored in a previous game or it may be a clear concept that has appealed to the child in another way. What is more clear is that it drives engagement with the game making process with the child repeating the name of the pattern in a sing song voice.

The child advocates for adding levels is something the child advocates for. It is likely that this has been picked up from the culture of the group.
EVIDENCE - Mi and Other Parent - "Have you seen Te's game it has 21 levels."

The is cultural understanding of the conventions of a platformer game being shown by both the child and adult. In terms of understanding of the game as a dynamic system, this is seen clearly in the parent’s alarm at the child’s deletion of all elements of hazard. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. “It’s no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid.” The child seems determined to remove all hazards.

"It is for me!" She may be aware of the implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play as explored in the previous chapter. Seemingly enjoying the cheekiness of her actions.

This interaction shows the parent guiding the child to imagine the user experience. A process repeated by this parent in different ways. In the vignette for example Sh shares "Must be quite hard to get through that door."

One interaction with the facilitator uses the debugging tool of the browser. [Move?]

**Social - Guided Participation**

Game making patterns are outlined by both the child and parent. They talk of adding more levels, of the mechanic of keys and doors in this vignette.

After a blockage caused by debugging coding is removed, the parent immediately re-engages the child. The parent says "Did you see Th?" and then prompts the child to play-test the game. The child is keen to both replicate the GDP of keys and doors in the second level and to add a new GDP of adding additional levels to the game.  

The child takes delight in outlining this pattern of game progression. The transformation from the period of time when her parent was problem solving code is dramatic.

The choice of a new GDP often involves new code to be added to the game or a significant change in code which needed debugging.
For this pair, larger coding activities were beyond the ability of the child from feedback date the parent shared this was due to reading ability but mentioned a strategy to deal with this.

"Th got on better during the coding once the student who was hovering initially left us alone.  Because every time Th hesitated, she jumped in to do it for her.  Whereas I know her better so can judge how to facilitate more minimally, and I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles.  Plus she can't read yet, so she was recognising the relevant bits of code by matching the individual letters, which takes longer."

The design choice of a grid of letters representing different elements of the platform game appears appropriate in the case of a novice learning to code and read at the same time.


<!-- NOTE - MOVE TO ANOTHER SECTIONS WITH TRIANGULATION? -->
<!-- ### Gdp and motivation -->
<!-- I propose that a contributing factor to this motivation is the ability to replicate a familiar pattern of game play via her own work in construction. It is the ability to translate this home knowledge into her own artefact which gives a sense of mastery over an otherwise foreign environment. -->


**Personal - Mutual Knowledge Creation**

<!-- The process of personal development of knowledge is less clear from video data.
NOTE - SOME MORE READING ON AN INTERPRETATION OF THIS THAT I CAN WORK WITH FOR THIS DATA IS PERHAPS NEEDED. -->

Personal knowledge and practices are harder to observe in the video data of mostly pair interaction. However, following Rogoff's interpretation of this personal plane as participatory appropriation, knowledge or processes which individuals take on and use fit within this plane. Thus beyond solo activity demonstrating personal knowledge, expressions of personal knowledge or practices when they are shared back into the community activity are also valid here.

There are cultural elements that are transmitted through interaction with the facilitator that this parents is very quick to pick up on. For example the use of the project documentation website of which the parent was an early adopter. Also, the debugging tool which the parent notices the facilitator using in this interaction is used by the parent in later sessions.

The parent shows an evolution of problems solving knowledge through their independent work.

The child shows their personal knowledge of game design patterns in end of course evaluation. She responded to the question What if - What would you like to see next time? What would you add? with the comment. "Th: I'd add a health bar and lots more levels and keep on changing the characters and background."



### Describing design stages for this pair beyond this interaction

<!-- NOTE - This section may move to a (previous) chapter (provisionally structured around inclusive methods) - of which overall interaction with design stages could be one aspect.
As such observations are listed in bullet point in case a lot restructuring is needed. -->

<!-- NOTE -  the chapter is moving towards GDP as main activity unit. or is this already addressed in Methodology / Design
 -->

I coded two complete sessions of this parent child pair. The following observations have been made by comparing the codes on stages of design and types of participant interaction. This data was then triangulated with the accompanying transcribed fragments of conversation and my own journal notes. The observations are presented themed by the design stages with some general observations listed at the start.

**General Observations at all stages**

- This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. Currently the parent takes the driving seat. (Their roles can be contrasted to pair programming).
- When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups (cf Rogoff, observation as valid form of participation)
- When possible, the parent engages child to input the design activities. This is done at different levels at different design stages.

**Ask / Imagine**

- In early ask/imagine stages parent and child discuss storytelling, graphical and other aesthetic choices
- The parent struggles to implement quite ambitious code challenges that she takes on but signals clearly when the process returns to ask / imagine stage indicating that she is aware of the greater possibility for effective child input at this stage.

**Plan**

- in planning stages the parent provides scaffolding to help the child.
- In one example the parent notices the child's difficulty in using cursor and delete/backspace keys to edit a matrix allowing level design. The parent provides a book with grid paper to allow the child to replicate the matrix. The parent then transcribes the design while engaging the child by checking she has interpreted the design correctly.    

**Create**

- At certain points in the create stage the parent needs total concentration and is not able to respond effectively to requests of  attention.
- At times the parent asked the child to seek help from facilitator.  
- At another time, when the child was bored waiting for parent debugging, she approached the facilitator to ask for help on behalf of the adult without prompting.  

**Test**

- The parent cedes the keyboard and mouse and sometimes swaps chairs to allow child to play test the game created.
- The testing process here is quite frustrating as gravity is very low. This is addressed later as it is improved on the suggestion of the parent who has to do the majority of the testing.

**Improve**

- Parent navigates to a particular part of the code for child to alter design
- Child takes on challenge of making smaller changes once the core game mechanic code has been added.

**Share**

- One of the most active times for the child allowing interaction to explain their game to others and to play the games of others.


#### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

<!-- NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION? -->

We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

- The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
- This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
- This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

Discussion

- The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity.


## Identifying GDP as key unit of Analysis

<!-- NOTE: How much of this needs to be relayed earlier in the Design chapter to explain design decision?
A LOT - MOVE THIS? -->


Previously we have explored the concept of activity as a primary unit for analysis. In particular the utility of this approach to research community activity (Cite Blunden). In this section I will explore how game design patterns became the primary unit of activity for participants.


With reference to the above sections on a) 3 foci of activity b) design cycle stages, there are varied goals of activity systems, with wider and narrower frames.

- very wide - learning computing skills and concepts as a home education project
- very wide - participating with other home educators in a creative environment and thus building team and communication skills
- very wide - learning transferable design skills and processes
- wide - creating a game which is fun to play and communicate an environmental theme
- medium - identifying and implementing key game features (Game Design Patterns) to add to the games
- narrow - creating, changing and transporting game assets to enact or change GDPs
- narrow - implementing or changing code constructs to enact or change GDPs

This analysis of w



- Drawing on AT terminology
- Discuss how GDP as key unit  was arrived at - draw on journal notes in planning stages
- Relate - AT terms to those of design stages
- Begin to comment on utility of GDP as a unit of analysis for practitioners, parents and young participants - i.e. in navigation and goal setting.
<!-- (see blunden for more on project as unit of Activity
https://www.activityanalysis.net/andy-blundens-vision-of-activity-theory/ )  -->

Discussion points

- How the GDP are sub activities goals in AT terminology.
- Thu, the game pattern goal rather than the overall making of a game, took up the majority of their focus.
- In playtesting with others the wider focus of making an engaging game comes into focus.
- The difference in goals in terminology
- How this unit allows a more detailed focus on some of the tensions involved in tool use

We have also looked at the other studies which look at game design patterns as a useful tool for advanced and less frequently for notice coders.

In the following sections, I draw on observations of participants in practice to outline how game design patterns are used in the making of games. I use extracts/ vignettes to do this.

## Cultural, Interpersonal & Personal Planes Analysis of use of GDPs

While each of these observations do not fall nearly into any one of the three planes being used as analytical tool, I begin with those oriented more to cultural focus which will deepen the observations in the previous chapter.


 and progress to the bulk of observations oriented chiefly to interpersonal activity and end with those more to do with personal knowledge construction.

## Cultural Plane / Apprenticeship - and Game patterns

In the (previous) chapter on inclusive methods the role of cultural activites to engage and sustain engagement were examined. This chapter allows us to examine the role of game design patterns through a cultural lens.


- Design patterns imagined used in other contexts as a form of apprenticeship
- Tools: Specifics on Code Playgrounds and Phaser and a Javascript framework
- the media literacy practices of transfer between tools - similar to other studies - see guided participation papers


### Use of design patterns as a form of / to facilitate apprenticeship

In 2019-05-08 Da and Te are working closely as a pair.

Da invites thinking outside of the constraints of the suggested design early in this first session. Add context if needed.

An interaction (see full transcript of interaction at the foot of this chapter) shows a rich interchange where the parent is trying to draw on the game playing experience

    Da: Have you thought about pushing it a bit further and have a different style of game?
    Te: What do you mean?
    Da: Well the previous style of game was a platform (makes shape with hands) game wasn’t it? You went along and there was gravity pushing down (points down). There are other types of games aren’t there?
    Te: Pause. I don’t know what to do thought.
    Da: Well quite but what other games are there?

Te adopts with this suggestion readily once he understands Da's suggestion in full.

    Te: You could have a game where every 15 seconds 10 seconds you could add and enemy to such and such a random number between such and such (holds up hands to indicate parameters). You could block it somewhere.
    Da: So instead of.. instead of the world… the world being sideways. We could have the world being looked down on. (reindicates the change of perspective)
    Te: Hmm. How should I do this then?
    Da: That’s a good question. Shall we ask Mick to see if that would mess things up or not?  
    Te: Mick
    Mick: Hi ya.
    Te: Erm. Thinking about what game to do . I was thinking can we make like a pacman game kind of thing (indicates movement of character with hands)
    Da: If we had an on the top game rather than a platform game
    Mick: I think it could work. You could kind of adapt that game by, kind of, removing gravity.
    Da: and see what happens?
    Mick: and see what happens.

Even saying "I was thinking can we make like a pacman game kind of thing".

Da speech show desire to for the pair to try something new. This may be to avoid repition in the educatational experience of the child or perhaps by the desire for challenge which would result from stepping outside of the existing walled garden of choices offered as existing guides. Their new choice is a change of perspective which involves a new game pattern of a new movement game mechanic. The specific proposal is to remove a jumping game mechanic and using a 2D top down movement mechanic used in maze and adventure games like Pac-man and Zelda.

However Da is still aware of potential challenges of straying too far from the templage. He does not want to "mess things up". There seems to be a mirror here of the value of playful enviroments to provide challenge but within some boundaries of safety.

My own positive response to their suggestion was driven partly from knowledge of Da's cultural background a both a professional coding and a volunteer supporting children's coding programmes. While simultaneously checking with other groups that they use the starting template as a base, to avoid overload as previously descussed in design decisions, I encourage this pair to see what happens as a potential learning opportunity. I am conscious that the change of movement may open up different posibilities for new game patterns that this pair may be able to solve.

There are cultural elements here of a family learning culture between these two playing out in this space. That way of approaching the task is very different from interactions with grandparents on a previous iteration.

This and other exerpt from this pair show that Te and Da's interaction is much more guided and focused than many other participants. This is influenced by Da's experience as a software engineer and volunteer at Coder Dojo.
This process of active guiding but suggesting and fishing for the right answer is intentional from the consistent nature of the interaction and from a supporting interview.

"Extract from interview with Da?" to support some of the above observations.

TRANSITION - Te and Da - have a very typical guided apprenticeship


### Accessing External Help

Te and Da - Accessing documentation Phaser

The process of modelling the specific practices of accessing developer documents and help forums is a form of apprenticeship and a direct sharing of a professional cultural practice.

Te takes a lead on looking for help on added a new GDP following enemies. He starts with menu, then book, then Da suggests googling and thus taking a step outside of the walled garden.

Discussion. There are pros and cons stepping outside that garden. Confusion, conflicts, complexity. etc. Vs. generating new patterns and personalisation of game content.


## Interpersonal Plane (Guided Participation)

I will recap Rogoff's take on guided apprenticeship and the features of the learning design which facilitate it.
If needed then I will explain how AT terms like division of labour are appropriate here.


### GDPs for Goal Setting and Prioritisation

The following exchange between participants Fi and Ma shows GDPs being used to organise future activity.

NOTE - This needs to be merged with the above - or a different take on it explored.

Online version as table -  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLx8j9djYqJdZHwKJ09mmIDMYO7YqlMDhuHx2hiqpJI/edit

    M: I’ve brought the music, and also we could just concentrate on one thing and just change that.
    You know, keep working through.
    F: Yeah. I think I want to get an enemy in - oh no - my person animated.
    M: so you want to get your person animated that’s the main thing
    M: Shall we concentrate on that and changing the platforms into something different?
    F: Yeah.
    M: Yeah?
    F: I also want to make a theme tune.
    M: Yeah it’s, that’s what I mean, you can’t just skip around like that.
    F: hmmm
    M: just cos it gets really overwhelming.
    M: Yeah..? So…?
    Long pause
    M: Well I’ll have a look at the code and see if I can make sense of that.



This example shows the use of the names number of game design patterns by the child .
While the planning discussion happens the child is concurrently testing their game.
At this stage of the design some have been imagined and perhaps partly worked on and dis-guarded. In addition, the child describes a feature that they want to see happen.

This interchange shows a tension between a more chaotic style of working jumping from one goal to another and potential resolution with parental dialogue prioritising work to be done.

Here the child may be picking activities to fit their strong suit of creating graphical and audio assets in other gui based environments. Leaving the father to piece things together in the code based progam.

Or perhaps the parent steers the child into graphical areas as they are able to continue without stressing out the parent. Thus the child's compliance may be a kind or pragmatic decision to allow smoother progress.

Discussion: The child's initial listing of features is a brainstorming technique. Such techniques are used to aid a creative process however the parent seems to lack the skill to map these out and then to work together to priortise them. Instead he appears to be keen to quickly pick one that seems manageable.

GDP are already being used as a way to set goals, track progress and prioritise but the process seems stressful or unsatisfactory. Some kind of support help scaffold this process would be potentially productive.

Note: Such support is explored in more detail in the next chapter.

### GDPs and division of Labour

Similarly, rather than direct delegation, dividing of labour can be observed.

The implementation of some GDP involved the use of different tools and activities. For example, the design of a graphical element suited some learners and they depended on the support of others to implement those changes in code.

For pair Fi and Ma the existence of GDP seems to empower the young person to direct a division on labour. See transcript of interaction for - <Files\\2019-03-11--fi_ma_pt1_TOCODE> - 18.00 mins

The child is able to jump around and work on parallel projects using their existing tools set, or even taking on researching other toolsets, for example independent work to find an online tool to created . This serves the child as it allows them to keep busy and moving different parts of the overall project forward.  

In contrast, the parent shares both with the child and the facilitator that they feel overwhelmed by the 'jumping around' between different GDP stages. While the parent wants to stick to one pattern and complete it, they are still responsive to help the child when they get stuck on an alternative pathway they have chosen to avoid waiting on the parent.

While this may be stressful for the parent, lots of progress in the overall game project can be observed in any particular session and the child seems to be developing useful skills managing the parent.

While the above interaction between Fi and Ma points to the parent doing the heavy lifting for code implementation, this was not always the case. Mi and Ne had a reverse relationship where the child would reluctantly implement the graphical changes in code but would pointedly not explain them seemingly taking pride in knowing something that her mother didn't.

ADD TRANSCRIPT EXAMPLE FROM  - 49:52.2 - 53:38.0 - 2019-03-18-mi

Here the child has a powerful position but misses a chance to develop useful communication skills.

The parent here takes great pride in the graphical work being done. This allows them a level of participation which is helpful without being stuck on more tricky technical or code related problems.
The design which allows choice of GDPs facilitates this. The process of building an identity as an individual or a family is shown in this families work on graphics.

ADD TRANSCRIPT EXAMPLE FROM  -  2019-03-18-mi
Mi - Oh thank you very much. I'm very proud.




#### Task delegation

While there was no formal organising of groups in phase 2 and 3, the family bonds between parents and children created similar patterns of seeking validation, sharing planning. Although this was more the case for dyads working side-by-side on the same game, similar patterns existed for other configurations.

The opening vignette shows the name of a GDP as a way to communicate about the shared work of making a game.
The utterance by the child "Key Door Person" seemingly indicated that the child ceded responsibility to the adult. The child has judged it the level of complexity needed to add a new pattern into the code to be beyond her ability and delegates appropriately.


|T: Go on then. Key - Door - Person.| |
|S: Person?| |
|T: Key Door Person.|(off screen) T indicates that her mother is the person she is referring to|

Gesture analysis (explained in a the methodology chapter) is valuable to shed light on this exchange.
It is the indication that the mother is the person who will be responsible for implementing the GDP that the child is tangentially prompting to be implemented.


### GDP and sustaining engagement

The process of adding in a new GDP to the game was often a sustaining activity. The transition from adding one GDP involves playtesting, which then often led to the identification of a next GDP to implement.

When GDP was completed and participant or pair move to a new phase there is evidence of a reenergising effect. e.g
Example of adding a new level in 2019-03-18-th_sh -

In the process of doing that, the pair return to a paper stage, and the process of turning that into reality on the screen and sharing with others is transformative in terms of energy level and interaction during the course of the session.

This activity can be examined with an interpersonal focus it is the product of interaction between the pair and the parent highlights the pivot point which facilitates input and greater engagement.  
In addition this shift can also been seen from a cultural focus. The completion is mirrored in the work of other pairs. Thus replicating is a kind of participation in an emerging community.
There is also a link made by the parent to previous working practices. Using a paper book to make a sketch of the work to be completed.


These kinds of shifts of activity and cultural practices brought by the participants also feed into the ongoing culture of the game making community. For example the use of paper designs and paper prototyping was something that I adopted more broadly after observing the families involved.


#### GDPs and personal expression (cultural) -

<!-- NOTE - CROSS OVER WITH PREVIOUS CHAPTER? (may need to move?) -->

As part of the creative process participants were able to input their own preferences and interests. These commonly seemed to be driven by existing preferences and habits stemming from home life and other cultural sites.

Examples include participants choice of the theme of their game. Environmental aspects appeared to be something that many families could draw on from their home lives.
Perhaps a transcript at start of process. Ma and Fi ?

Another opportunity involved choice and design of game assets that allowed the expression of identity or a designed element - for example graphics, audio or a written message to appear at various stages of the game.

Graphics in particular seemed to be driven by home cultures. One example is that of Sh and th using a g background graphics in 2019-03-18-th_sh -

The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;]
- cultivativing a sense of ownership
- playing around the graphic - covering it over and revealing it
- participant self-expression and a conversational prompt to other during sharing of the game

This is supported by other research on digital making and motivation. CITATION HERE? - or in cultural discussion?  

Discussion on how cultural interactions seem to be able to motivate and sustain other interpersonal activity which may be experienced as work.

These interactions re sometimes playful, and sometimes chance to share something serious. It allows young person to talk about dogs and their love of dogs. Even at one point that they used to have two and one died.


#### GDPs propagation through peer activity

The process of adding levels was something that was spread predominately through one child's work to help others to add that features. The work of the child to add 21 levels to their own game served as a way to publicise this possibility. The role of that child as an expert in that design pattern, and their willingness to share their knowledge, shifted focus away from help from myself as a facilitator, or the instruction-based support documents.

### GDPs to support Flexible (Iterative) Design Practices

Iterative agile design is a highly cultural / interpersonal process.

Discussion drawing on more radical attempts to describe the best way to bring young learners into a design practice.

Perhaps in the field of participatory design.

Highlight how the granular and relatable nature of GDP

Well suited to build a repeated design practice.
Especially with starting documents,
Small changes had big effects.
Variable changes needed immediate testing.  


### Interaction of GDPs with Playtesting as method

Playtesting but in particular designing for others .
What was noticeable about - this in particular?

Playtesing as a regular practice is a immediate way to shift learners into a perspective designing for others.

This fits into our design cycle, as our first stages of ask and imagine are more productive when informed by a realistic sense of what the end user experience is. Regular self testing and playtesting achieve this.

Some examples: (should be many)

Pull on examples of learners imagining the experience of others.
 - Th - in session 2019-03-11  - comments on wanting students to be frustrated when playing it, it's fun - then the final level being a secret fun experience playing against the norms of platform game design, thus illiciting surprise.
 - Another example -

Discussion - Designing for others - as a key perspective in constructionism.
Note: What added insights or tips for practitioners can I bring here?

Also noticeable is the variety of ways in which playtesting happens and how younger and older participants looked to give and take from the experience.

Older participants often used this as a way of being supportive to both parents and young people. This happened in the following ways:
- praising graphical content
- making links with home interests of participants and building rapport - ( e.g. do you like dogs? )


## Personal Plane

The personal plane is explored in a following chapter (working title Maps). This will cover findings relating to the value of participatory methods of mapping project progress and potential learning dimensions of activities.

<!-- Provide a link to next chapter - but before that a round up / discussion / to specific elements in relation to GDPs

May need a way to differential this chapters discussion of GDP - and that of the next one.
 -->


### Mutual approaches to knowledge building

In this section the processes of personal appropriation of experience and knowledge emerging from game making are examined closely in relation to participants experience of GDPs.

 - quick summary of Rogoff's take on personal appropriation compared to a transmission model of knowledge & that participants re-contribute their experience of knowledge beck into the social mix
 - e.g - GDPs used in this research program were mutually created based on feedback from participants
 - While there is a curricular value attached to CT concepts & to some extent design practices, in this context participants can create their own understandings of what is useful to them.

### Game Design Patterns as a way to give language to participants when sharing back to Community

Example - 2019-03-18 - Sh & Th

Contrast general lack of confidence with ability to share back progress and decisions using language afforded by GDPs.

Include excerpt? 1.05 - Looking for Th using GDP language - as well ask drawing on other home interests.

This is also dealt with above "GDPs propagation through peer activity"

## GDP as a way to explore Computational Thinking Concepts

## Representing Coded the Patterns of Activity via coded data

NOTE - NOT SURE WHERE TO PUT THIS PART OR IF THE CHART ELEMENT IS REALLY VALUABLE - IT COULD BE A DISTRACTION (IT PROBABLY IS - PERHAPS ADD AS A POSSIBILITY IN CONCLUSION)

We can to examine patterns of activity is through an analysis of the coded video interactions. The coding structure decided upon and the process of coding in five minutes sections.

<!-- NOTE - there may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granuar detail if this process is useful.  -->

Note The full coding scheme will be included here.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit?usp=sharing

The main schemes as below.

- Design Stages -
- Interaction Description -
- Game Elements Addressed (Game Polish, Game Space, Game Mechanics, Game Challenge(remove?))

The process of coding data shed light onto patterns of activity in creating a list of general behaviours shared by participants and thus also identifying outlying behaviours that did not meet the emerging coding scheme. (NOTE FOR HERE OR PREVIOUS?)

Later in the chapter the limits of the chosen design stage schema are explored as a way of illuminating interesting game making behaviour of participants.

<!-- See current table here.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit?usp=sharing -->

In the following section I use key tools provided by the research software Nvivo to give insight about the engagement of participants by compare time on different tasks.

<!-- For example for the session that the vignette was taken from the below is chart of the time on each of the codes. -->

The coding structure (may) also allows to show the overlap between different code areas. This is useful to explore a question like the following:

- Question One: During which design phase does parent-child pair interaction happen most frequently?
- Question Two: What are the different patterns for participant interaction that happen when working on different game elements?

TO COME.

The first scenario represented in a chart which compares activity grouping with design stages and activity description.

Pair work -> TEST, CREATE, IMPROVE, etc
Peer work -> TEST, CREATE, IMPROVE, etc
Solo work -> perhaps dont an

CHART

The second scenario is represented by pie charts for each game element showing the duration spent on each by a diversity of participants.  

CHART

#### Discussion on data
<!-- NOTE - MOVE THIS? DOESN'T SEEM TO FLOW IN THIS SECTION -->

For the first question only suitable pairs were chosen. This removes a lot of validity from any generalisation of claims that could be made.
This approach has some clear limits. Firstly the breaking of data into 5 min sections is practical but does not allow for some of the finer interactions and changes of behaviour to be accurately coded.  There may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granular detail.

The game elements / design patterns categories which are presented are created as a design guide rather than on exact principles.
It is possible to code drilling down into another level. This might yield more results.

In summary, the coding process is more valuable as a tool to allow more qualitative reflection and analysis rather than a quantitative process as attempted above.

To make a quantitative approach work better X,Y and Z would need to be in place which was not suitable for this study because of A and B.

<!-- By coding the activity of the child and the adult for this session in depth the following representation of how the child spent their time is available.

- time under table
- time in control of Keyboard
- time actively directing parent's activity
- time actively observing parent's activity
- time discussing game features with parent -->



## Additional Chapter Discussion

The following observations are primarily focused on implications for practitioners.
A deeper exploration of other concepts may suit another chapter looking at synthesing observations in relation to broader research. In this draft the focus is included in each sub-title.


#### The limits of design cycle stages
[PERHAPS SOME OF THIS TO DISCUSSION?]

When coding data a design cycle framework was one of the code structures. REFER BACK TO ENGINEERING SOURCE.
Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share.

While design cycles was not an explicitly part of the game making instruction, certain interventions supported this approach. In particular the use of maps as a planning and reflection tool and the use of playtesting as a social and personal form of evaluation of emerging designs.

When coding I quick became aware of the limits and challenges to coding to this.

For example a lot of time in this informal game-making sessions were spent on activities outside of this cycle.
For example, opening up the right tools, navigating to correct locations and finding past assets involved a fair deal of effort and collaboration.

I have been pragmatic and map elements like this these loosely. Where appropriate I make notes on that activity in free form areas of other documents like spreadsheets.

This limits claims I can make from the coded data. However it raises interesting points which merit discussion.

First - Value Faff Time.
So much of the creative process is faffing. More precisely many creative moments happen in times not neatly represented in the cycle.
For example the navigation to the right location in creative software, finding assets, migrating assets between authoring tools, converting to correct formats, evaluating new tools.

This is something that I do not have a precise name for. I call it digital laundry or digital housekeeping. Things that at times can be low attention span or which can be extremely frustrating like needing to tidy up so you can find your car keys.
There is frustration here, but there are also moments of creativity, and there are bonding moments which are undirected activity but shared.  
For example.....

Second - Digital Jamming
This has an example in the use of sound making software Fi & Ma -
The process of tinkering and messing spurs creativity that doesn't map to a design cycle.

They are in an evaluation of tools which could be said to be in Planing. however this quickly become creation as they decide the spontaneously created music is preferable to the one created using a different tool at home.

The joint jamming then has created two different soundtracks. This sparks a new thought to create different soundtracks for different levels.
This would fit within the Imagine stage.
Plan then Create then Imagine then Revise all in the space of a minute.

Implication one - When mapping the activity to a design cycle. There may not be neat matches and at some stage if the process is very fragmented the researcher or teacher can legitimately ask how valuable the design cycle is as a planning or analytical tool. Others exist like rhizomatic approaches.

Implication two -when designing a program and thinking of how to present the process to participants, over structuring around a design cycle approach may be not be productive or accurate.
Question? How does this relate to tinkering methodology?
What other framework would be suitable here?


### Discussing Game design patterns as a tool to expose and give participants a language to discuss tensions (Practitioner focus)

Synthesise examples which highlight the value of developing share language and short cuts. Draw from the above examples.

However, also look at potential short comings of short cuts - hiding more complex patterns within the name. When short cuts or misapprehensions prove less useful.

For example the shortcut of a name for a pattern in Fi and Ma's interaction hides a large amount of problems solving which seems "overwhelming"

Is there an advantage to less support in terms of setting out a pathway which participants cover step by step. Or is the process of working on a sprawling problem which seems unmanagable, but which in with participants have to

### Discussion - Pumping up the Jam - allowing for improvisation in design process.

In many interactions we see improvisational approaches.

Example from Te and Da - 2019-05-08 -

    Da- use paper to design
    Te - I'm just going with it

The tools, process and the community encourage a jam / improvisational approach. Remixing, chipping away, a shattering of design cycles. More of an informal approach

The concept of Jam is explored in rapid, improvisational events called Game Jams.



### Design patterns as a "middle level" construct to open door to more concrete and abstract (Wider focus)

<!-- NOTE THIS STRAYS IN TO CT - FIND THE DIVIDING LINE -->

In the introduction of this thesis I highlighted some of the challenges for inclusivity and motivation of more abstract approaches including a prescriptive approach to Computational Thinking. We have seen how Papert and Turkle celebration of diversity in approaches and in particular concrete coding approaches has influenced the design of popular educational programming software.  

In this chapter we have encounter examples of the use of GDP as a concrete and relatable construct that facilitates communication, engagement, planning and division of labour. Then enactment of GDP emerged from this exploratory design to be the key unit of activity.

In professional coding programmes design patterns, particularly in object-oriented approaches, are seen as a useful middle ground between abstract CT concepts and more concrete techniques.
Find proffessional source here or before.

See notes here
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1my3iDjivq64gdcXsmwqKVP0QJMDvfBN3MsD0FoeI4Qs/edit


There are the advantages of both a relatable, tangible shape of unit of activity linked to a community of practice.

They also include a more abstract / and thus Nrepeatable structure thus fulfilling some of the promise transfer offered by CT advocates.

The heart of the matter here is how transferable knowledge is without a contextual meaning attached.  This is a contested area.

Firstly how wide should reuse be imagined? To other coding projects? Or wider claims as with Wing's interpretation of CT.

In this context of novice coders in an informal environment it seems appropriate to introduce some levels of reusable practice whilst initially prioritising individual learner engagement and community participation.

We can see evidence of both the potential for reusable elements of knowledge and practice involving practice in the following ways;

- Use of levels as a array which is parsed by a loop to create layout
- Functions - code patching into the right area
- Complicated if statements
- Other examples of computing construct which novices use without full understanding.

In the following chapter, the potential to explore Computational Thinking is discussed on more depth.

### Design patterns as a teaching aid in informal vs formal environments

See journal notes and contrast with existing research with GDP, and learner choice, and levels of abstraction techniques

From the literature what are complexities involving the practitioner practicalities? What does this research add to these debates?

One to one instruction to explain concepts is ideal but unrealistic in classrooms.


## Final Section - Synthesis

Summary on contribution to existing research

Bring more synthesis here especially in translation of design elements due to this context

Ideas to develop:

- Whereas Game Jams focus on x, 3m has a focus on y.
- GDP and types of errors?

### Link Paragraph

A theme to follow up in the Maps / personal learning chapter is that of picking up on some of the behaviour of participants, especially that of experienced parents, experience either in coding practices of supporting their children. Once identified, how could beneficial interactions be encouraged in the next iteration of design.

Examples include;

- supporting reflection on design and coding concepts / skills.
- navigation / organisational support - use of a physical map.

For example, the use of CT concepts in a framework, listed as part of the initial design pattern card, which could then be discussed, ticked off or otherwise reflected on.


## Transcript Excerpts


### 2019-05-08-te-da pt 1

    Da: Have you thought about pushing it a bit further and have a different style of game?
    Te: What do you mean?
    Da: Well the previous style of game was a platform (makes shape with hands) game wasn’t it? You went along and there was gravity pushing down (points down). There are other types of games aren’t there?
    Te: Pause. I don’t know what to do thought.
    Da: Well quite but what other games are there?
    Te: I don’t know er.
    Da: Well I tell you what .. muffled.
    Te: Erm - (navigates to list of GDP for platform game)
    De: So. You played them before didn’t you (indicating grid of games )
    Te: What do you mean?
    Da: The flying game that’s a different kind of game
    Te: Oh like kind of like moving along kind of thing
    Da: Yeah and those where. There are games where you are in a world and you have to move around the world like pac-man (points down and moves an imaginary character around),
    Te: nod
    Da: There are games where things drop down like Tetris
    Te: … game. You could have a game where every 15 seconds 10 seconds you could add and enemy to such and such a random number between such and such (holds up hands to indicate parameters). You could block it somewhere.
    Da: So instead of.. instead of the world… the world being sideways. We could have the world being looked down on. (reindicates the change of perspective)
    Te: Hmm. How should I do this then?
    Da: That’s a good question. Shall we ask Mick to see if that would mess things up or not?  
    Te: Mick
    Mick: Hi ya.
    Te: Erm. Thinking about what game to do . I was thinking can we make like a pacman game kind of thing (indicates movement of character with hands)
    Da: If we had an on the top game rather than a platform game
    Mick: I think it could work. You could kind of adapt that game by kind of removing gravity.
    Da: and see what happens?
    Mick: and see what happens.
    Da: It’s not a bad starting idea is it?
    Te: I suppose make a new one (begins the process of remixing game from the template)
