## Research Questions - June 2023

- What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to game coding and design?
<!-- - What pedagogical factors are significant to support novices learning coding, particularly in game making contexts? -->
- How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?
- How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?

## Introduction

This chapter is concerned with examining the impact on participants of the learning design explored in the last chapter.

- The first section examines the impact of a process drama with an aim to establish and nurture community practice. It highlights the value of introducing almost-real processes, near authentic tools and the possibility of learners developing learning identities within a drama frame.
- the use of core tools in the initial learning design
- community behaviour and design processes

In the discussion section, the chapter builds on material explored in the literature to explore:

- the development of agency in this learning design, Particular attention is given to processes which support learners to develop agency in the game making process.
- design concepts to support novices learning coding in game making contexts.

<!-- Inspired by Heathcote, the importance and challenges of authenticity in tool use are examined, using activity theory concepts, in the context of seeding and nurturing learning community processes. The learner agency and the ability for learners to develop their identities as designers are of key interest.  -->

## Exploring the impact of a drama processes

The introduction of a drama process was introduced in response to a the barriers to participation caused by not identifying with the culture of coding or gaming. This section describes the addition ot the intervention and explores its value as a pedagogical tool to seed game coding practices and to develop learner agency.

### Vignette 4.1.a - Introducing a drama process

The participants have entered the room and chosen a laptop to work on. Some of the children play web-based games or reviewing the games that they have made previously. The session progresses with a warm-up game which includes many false starts, changes of rules, development of tactics, appeals to be serious, full throated laughter and many restarts and which ends in good hearted failure. The transcript below picks up at this point.

<!-- The purpose of the vignette is to situate the reader, give an overview of -->

> Mick: Ok. So I’ve got a surprise. I don’t know if you know but as part of our Home Ed club we did a page of different games. So it’s on glitch.com and it’s called Glitch Game Club and it’s on there, there’s one for Home Ed Winter 2019 and here are all the games that we made. We made a lot of games. 15 games. This has not gone unnoticed because I got a message through this account. This is kind of a story now. We are entering a story. You have to use your imagination. We got a message and it was an audio message. If you guys take your fingers off your keyboards and have a listen to this audio message which is quite unusual as I don’t think it was from anyone on … this ... Earth.

    Greetings Earthlings, we have an important message for the Glitch Game Makers.
    We are the Weean. You would call us an alien lifeforce. We like to think of ourselves as friendly space cousins.
    We can see your Internet from space. We are contacting you because we know you are making games on the Internet.
    We are on our way to the Planet Earth, and we have an important mission for you. We are an Intergalactic Rescue team. We know you have problems on your planet. We can help.
    But we need to find out one thing first. Are you worth it? After we are gone will you also be able to help yourselves? Or are you already doomed to make the same mistakes again?
    You must pass this challenge. Make some games showing problems you have on earth. In the games also include ideas for how to solve them.

    We have some guidelines:

      • Make a game about a big or small problem to solve. If you can let us play it each week as you go along.
      • Give us an update each week by recording a group update.
      • Show you can work on your own but also work as part of a team.
      • We will also send you text messages with some mini-missions sometimes. Be sure to tell us how you do.

    Please now get started and come up with a new game about solving a problem on Earth.


> Mick: I couldn’t understand all of it but I tried to write it down as best as I can. So from what I’ve work out they’ve looked at our games and they’ve come up with a challenge for us. They are coming to Earth so they need to find out if we are worth saving. And the way that they are going to decide is by playing the games that we come up with. And they are going to set us little challenges. So. yeah, that’s the story. (with heavy irony) I’m pretty sure it’s true. (Mick and others laugh).

> Mick: So all they’re asking us to do is to come up with a game. We’ve got four sessions. They want a new game because they’ve already played our old games. It’s got to be something about the problems of the world. I’ve got a lot of problems. It could be big problem or a small problem. It could be about your problems. But also ideas on how to solve them.  
And yeah. That we can work by ourselves but also work as part of a team. So we’ve got to give them a report by the end of each session as well. That’s our mission.


### Description of Vignette 4.1.a
<!-- q: How much to reference back to previous chapter? -->

<!-- The drama game which is served to put participants at their ease, to make communication between peers easier after engaging in play, to decentre the learning environment by creating a circle with more equal participation. As explored in the literature review, the use of such games to help set up informal learning environments is COMPLETE  -->

<!-- After the  excerpt which introduces a dramatic scenario involving a fictional audience I orientate learners in suggested use of support documentation. A full transcript is available in the appendix which outlines that process. -->

The process of introducing a scenario for participant to respond to is common in project based learning in this vignette. Here it is extended using a dramatic element in line with Heathcote on Mantle of the Expert and other process drama techniques (explored in Lit Review). In this section, I describe the vignette using concepts from MoE. Further analysis follows in a later section.

<!--
REMOVED
While inspired by the work on Heathcote on Mantle of the Expert, not all element of the process align directly. For example, the drama does not try to position the participants as expert game makers in a professional context. However, t -->

The following tenets of MoE from Aiken's summary [-@aitken_dorothy_2013] apply. Aitken's and Heathcote's terms follow in italics. Within a _fictional context_ a _responsible team_ is contracted into a _commission_ by a _client_. The facilitator _frames curriculum elements_ as productive tasks and plans for _tensions_ to arise involving: _authentic contexts_, _messiness of learning_, maintaining learner interest and _resilience_ to overcome the _grappling and struggling_ involved. The following sections explore some of these key concepts via the example in vignette.

_Contracting into drama_

As a facilitator, I indicate that we are entering a dramatic process and attempt to draw everyone along with me using the following sentence _"This is kind of a story now. We are entering a story. You have to use your imagination"_. This serves to start the process of contracting in a drama. As a way to introduce the imagined audience, I reference that the games are online and have been noticed by aliens. The use of heavy irony in my voice when concluding the scenario, "I'm pretty sure it's true" and the resulting laughter form an informal collusion that we are playing along with this fiction. The collusion is noted by both parents and children in recorded exchanges. For example, after engaging with a code example provided by myself in the role of the aliens, one pair make the following comment.

> Parent: Look, this is what Mick's showed, what Mick's has done.

> Child: The Weean have done!

> Parent: The Weean, sorry yes.

_Facilitator activities in role_

My role is a link between the participant and the fictional commissioners of the games. The transcript above (a fuller version is in appendix 4.x) captures a rare example of myself extended facilitator input as instruction. As a practitioner teaching technology, I try to limit teacher talk and being overly directive to prevent learner disengagement. COMPLETE.

<!-- NOTE - support with lit? also is this one tension or two  -->

Balancing leaner choice with over-ambition is a tension explored in the previous chapter. The drama narrative helped resolve some of this personal tension by allowing me to outline boundaries and be directive using the dramatic commission as a foil to help avoid the encounter feeling personally combative or controlling [heathcote_drama_1985].

_Learner activities in role_

Beyond the wider fictional frame of the making activity, learners were also sometimes asked to undertake some activities in role, in particular reflection in role. This and other example are explored via the second vignette.

<!-- Choices

- Or could look at the whole family unit mi, zi and ne - And their interactions with alien narrative. -->
<!-- Something like the social activity of Vignette Sh and Th - perhaps even that one - as it goes on to
describe the different kinds of interactions. But that is more interpersonal interactions for the most part.
Here we are looking at something cultural?? -->

### Vignette 4.1.b - Session reflections and secret missions

This second extract comes from the following session in phase four. In three of the four session the last 10 minutes of each session involved giving a progress update to the aliens.

> Mick: Ok are you guys ready to share back if you could come to this side of the room we are going to get Mark and Edward to share back first. Everyone can share back using this computer that the Weean are watching if that’s alright.

> Mark: All we’ve done today is just get a background in and then we were just working on the one that the Weean had sent us about  dropping the coins in. Now that the Weean have sent us the code we need for basically dropping stuff.

> Mark: The idea is planting trees. about dropping seeds. So we want to drop those and have some enemies that are tweening randomly around and also taking them away. The idea is to have a timer to drop a certain amount in a certain time frame or you can’t go through to the next level. And the next level would be you go around and water all the trees. And the third one is you have to look after them all making sure they are not getting chopped down again by that tweening enemy. So we’ve got the concept and everything now and we’ve got the code So we should be able to make a bit of a jump forward now this week.  It doesn’t look like we’ve got any where but we have. (Mark laughs and others follow). So we’ve got the the background in and we know what we need to do about scrolling as well because we want to scroll across.

> Mick: That’s great.  Is there anything that you think you definitely want to be able to do for next time that you might want help with?

> Mark: Oh yeah. We’ll we’ve got a bit of space where we can work on it before we next come in so we’d like to ask the Weean some more questions. Is that the best way to do it?

> Mick: Yeah for sure and I can see that you guys have been talking to the Weean, Here this project here in your home page called Talking to the Weean allows you to talk to the Weean. So you can go in there, click on Edit Project and if you click on this bit here that says WEEAN and then Markdown you can actually just ask questions in here.

> Ed: Weean what’s it like up there?

> Weean: It’s cold and very big but quite tranquil.

> Ed: What is your name?

> Weean: We are are the Weean we have no name, we are all the same.

### Description of Vignette 4.1.b

<!-- IS MORE DESCRIPTION NEEDED HERE. ? -->

In this extract participants are invited to take turns showing their game, recapping their progress and outlining next steps to the alien observers. I play the role as a liaison facilitating the process for the fictional, remote audience. I also draw attention to the secret missions that had been distributed to participants (along with social missions - both explore later in this chapter).

### Reflecting in role

**It doesn't look like we've got anywhere but we have!**

<!-- **My reflections as a practorganiser itioner from my journal and those emerging from the process of transcribing and analysing the interactions.** -->

While drama scenarios can aid reflection both in or out of drama, O'Neill and Lambert outline the value of in-drama reflection, noting it is "likely to be more powerful than end-of-session discussion, since it allows individual and group insight to be articulated as part of the context" [-@oneill_drama_1982, p. 144]. In line with this intervention, they propose one way of achieving in-role reflection is to introduce an additional character that acts as an external audience. In this intervention however, main activities happen only weakly in role, whereas the end reflection highlights the fictional frame of the making more strongly.

In my journal notes for phases prior to using the drama process, I documented that the occasional end of session debriefs as _go-rounds_ had limited success in terms of amount and quality of participation compared to these sessions. The video and audio recordings document rich feedback from individuals and pair teams, near complete participation and productive elements of interaction as the feedback progresses.

In previous iterations, my omission of end-reflection in sessions stemmed fomr a lack of time in sessions and reluctance to shift learners away from making activities to reflective activities. I found the need to maintain the drama narrative served as a high motivation factor to complete reflection activities.

To begin the reflection session I ask participants to gather around a particular computer which the aliens are monitoring which helped moving participants closer to each other and stop their coding activity. It is of value to review the grouping of participants in the still image in the vignette above in Fig 5.x. The simple clustering of participants so they were side by side and talking to a disembodied audience via a computer seemed to make the feedback process less daunting for students. One of the younger participants Richie is participating on the margins but clearly following proceedings as his facial reactions to ongoing contents of feedback. He later participates more actively when reflecting on his process than in previous sessions. Even participants that were initially reluctant to share back and had never shared back publicly before in sessions, chipped in after other family member had started the process for them.  

MORE DETAILS ON DATA? A QUICK SUMMARY PERHAPS OF
NOTE ON CODING - LIMITED

Using the terms of student agency explored in the literature review, here we can see the use of the drama narrative used as a second stimulus both by facilitator and participants to overcome conflicts in convening and participating in reflection, and project sharing [@sannino_principle_2015].  

NOTE - ALTHOUGH INTRODUCED BY FACILIATOR NOT STUDENTS

<!-- While not all participants engaged with written tutorials. The next chapter explores the process in more detail from the perspective of a participant wanting to implement a particular game design pattern. -->

<!-- This observation is supported by research which encourages varied approaches in addition to instruction-based approaches [@dietz_design_2021; @resnick_coding_2020]. Other studies address barriers to literacy in technical project work  explore written instructions within the drama frame thus providing a greater incentive for participants to engage with the material [@blunden2014seeking]. [SEE LIT REVIEW FOR MORE EXPLORATION]. -->

<!-- The exploration of documentation with the drama frame aimed to disrupt this pattern of identification giving participants a motivation to read in role.  -->
<!-- Evidence for this means of communication is promising however because these processes were brought into the design at a relatively late stage, there is not enough data to make larger claims beyond surfacing this potential. -->

<!-- NOTE - bRING IN A QUOTE FROM ATHENA TO SUPPORT?  -->

<!-- and attempting to shift patterns of working from printed sheets to working online This was partly to be able to capture how participants interacted with documentation more easily as I would be able to review it on their screen in captured data.  -->


### Observations on written interactions with the alien in the drama


#### Exploring documentation and accessing technical help within the drama frame

In the first phase of the project, I had promoted the use of a mailing list to ask technical and code questions of the wider group. This surfaced a conflict where parents were reluctant to bother other participants with such issues.

To address this, as part of the drama process, I encouraged participants to communicate with the aliens to ask help. To do this in a way that encouraged other participants to join in, I created a project in the shared coding project area with a webpage that could be edited and viewed by participants. When in the vignette 4.1.b Mark asks "We’d like to ask the Weean some more questions (to overcome coding blockages), is that the best way to do it?", he is referring to this project webpage. To seed this process, I had entered a question sent by Mark and Ed via email into the page, and written a response on behalf of the aliens.

Dan and Toby also received help from the aliens to implement a pattern of creating random movement in their pac-man clone game. For this pair, the process of reading a code suggestion from the aliens gives the parent opportunity to deconstruct the code in detail to explore coding concepts. In later discussion, Dan uses the fiction of the alien to playfully chastise me for using code syntax which was harder for novices to read.

    "Mick, do you think the aliens would mind if we get rid of the switch statement and replace it with some if-thens? They're just showing off these aliens aren't they?"

Here the text dialogue with the aliens is used as a mediating artefact first by the facilitator to share help in-role, and then by a parent to suggest a modification to the code syntax used and indicating a more general tactic of using readable code structures in novices.  

**Thus, in summary,** the process of writing down a text request in-role potentially addresses the (previously-explored) barriers asking for help by de-personalising the process. It also encourages the adoption of professional practice of asking a written question to overcome a coding problem and thus builds experience of using technical terms.

### Playful dialogue with the aliens unrelated to game making

The process of asking the aliens for technical help within a code project sparked a playful process of informal chatting with the aliens. During in our end of session reflection above, I noted the following ad-hoc encounter that a child initiated on the interactive page while his father was taking a break from coding.

    Ed: hi Weean,
    Weean: We are are the Weean we have no name, we are all the same.
    Ed: What is your name?
    Weean: We are are the Weean we have no name, we are all the same.
    Ed: That must be hard at xmas
    Weean: It is. It sure is.

Inspired by the positive reaction of participants to this playful engagement with the fictional audience, I asked a student helper to participate remotely to play the part of the alien. The student then gave feedback via live text interaction to participants in the final session. The process started with supportive and celebratory messages posted from the alien. The impact was significant with the young people with 5 out of 7 engaging by writing messages and all mentioning the interactions verbally during the session.

In addition to the stated feedback activity the live chat served wider purposes of building an insider rapport, creating a fun atmosphere, celebrating the completion of games in the absence of a public showcase, and signposting other achievements. For some pairs, while the child interacted in the live chat, parents performed final tweaks to code projects and challenges. Two parents in particular worked hard debugging more complex elements of the game with facilitators and peers. Other parents engaged with the chat and encouraged their children to get feedback from the aliens about their game in particular.

The start of process began when Ed in a moment of free time expanded the use of space initially imagined to address technical needs by initiation a playful interaction which, while in the motivation to support different learner identities, was a novel, volitional action in this context. To use TADS terminology, Ed is in conflict, not able or wanting to engage in his existing creative activities while his father has a social break. Using the secondary stimulus of a text chat with fictional aliens, he writes a playful personal question to the aliens as an expression of volitional action to play, casts out an experimental kedging anchor. By co-incidence, I was on a different computer, saw this question, and was able to respond in real time. Thus, by getting a response, Ed's kedging anchor caught onto an anchor point and Ed was able to resolve this conflict of inactivity and in doing so both amuse himself and other other with humorous self-expression, and open-up a novel, child-centred activity for the whole group which could also address potential issues of alienation from the culture of _serious coding_ expressed by other participants.  

To express this using affordance theory, the affordance offered by the medium of communication is repurposed and made more visible by Ed's use of it to ask playful questions.

<!-- NOTES
- identity of playfulness  
  -->

### Use of side missions to encourage varied creative practices

<!--
Perhaps add back in as an unintended consequence?
The live chat process started unintentionally as one child was left to their own devices as a parent was undertaking a social mission (see below and previous chapter). -->

The above example is a naturally occurring expression of learner agency which was incorporated into the drama process later in this phase. Other examples of emergent practices, explored later in the chapter, which served to increase the scope of agency, became a core processes without the need to introduce them as part of a drama process. NOTE-  SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

In contrast, both the main mission of given in role to make a game to entertain and inform visiting aliens, and extra social and secret mission were delivered with the frame of a drama process, with an explicit aim to encourage patterns of behaviour which had emerged in previous iterations of game making. I had identified these behaviours as potentially helpful in maintaining the positive affect and identification with the on-going group process of game making.

AN EXAMPLE?

A table of both social and public missions follows. These mission were printed out on cards and one of each type was given to the participants in the first half of the first two sessions.

In the transcript above of vignette 4.1.b we see that in the reflection participants engage in a lively discussion about the secret missions they had been given. Encouraged by he mother Molly, Nadine shares that she has been highly engaged in the disruptive secret mission  (explored later). While Dan and Toby express playful frustration, Mark and Ed contribute by sharing their more subtle disruption and Richie is keen to have his rude noise mission noticed and commented on. Some public missions had a noticeable impact in this session particularly in  stimulating a discussion among parents around which arcade games they played as youths.

Thus these sanctioned non-design activities, designed to reduce participant stress, to encourage the exploration of the games of others are taken up enthusiastically by much of the community. In analysis of one key sessions involving missions from which the transcript was taken. Out of 10 participants, 8 visibly engaged with the secret missions during the session.

<!-- PROVISIONAL BRING accurate FIGURES TO THIS. -->

The process was not without friction. After initially engaging with the process of secret games, Toby and Dave, who were later working on a tricky coding process, expressed frustration at interference. Thus, while promising, limits to this process should be evaluated to avoid overly disruptive behaviour which create barriers to progress. For example, time limits could be in place.  

During the vignette above, Richie occupies a peripheral position and is interaction with his laptop still. However, he reacts positively when Ed's irreverent questions to the Weean are read out.

The positive reaction of young people to the drama process was also  picked up on by one pair in interview data.


    Mark: You liked those games where you had to kind of hack somebody else?
    Ed: Yeah
    Mark: It was it because there was a sense of play ... and a bit of anarchy.
    Ed: Yeah.
    Mark: The weird thing was, I think it was a massive hit for everybody because it just brought sense of play and fun. And it took attention away from it being overly technical process.

<!-- I really like I found the wean thing, the most interesting thing about last session. Okay. I felt that the kids loved it too. So tell me a bit about that, how that how that kind of what people do in the way. What was it you liked about the way they're just very silly? Yes. The answer to your questions? Yes. Did you really enjoy the fact that this earthly body was answering your questions? Yeah. It was it because there was a sense of play, offensive form, and a bit of anarchy. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Whilst he tells all the way, I'm sure was that there was a little sabotage things you have to do wasn't that you liked those games where you had to kind of hack somebody else? Yeah. What missions did you go? What happens? Spaces to change someone else sound but the math changed it and read it. That exactly like that even though it was quite different, but it wasn't it wasn't enough of a change. But Reuben had to us and they put like a really loud cow fat thing and we didn't know. I said it was great for ages. And he felt that was Larry. Yeah, the weird thing was, I think it was a massive hit for everybody because he just brought sense of play and fun. And it took attention away from it being overly technical person. -->

<!-- It is of value to briefly discussion the value of the missions in relation to drama process theory and play theory.  -->

The secret missions encourage various forms of disruptive play, griefing of playing against the game [@bakioglu_spectacular_2008; @bartle_hearts_nodate]. While this increases engagement for some learners the process also suffered the same bleed from acceptable cheekiness and play which explores boundaries, to mildly disruptive ones which in this context involved frustration and wasted time for other users. Side missions or side quests are also used in open world games are used in part to appeal to different kinds of players [@bartle_hearts_nodate].

<!-- This tallies with observations from journal, interviews and video data of participants. -->

Existing research on digital making and creative coding has emphasised the role of personal expression to incentivise the creative process [Scratch roque community]. The creation of personally meaningful object to share with a community is a foundational concept in Papert's constructionism [CITE]. While the 3M design is more limited than a Scratch media project in the potential to incorporate home interests, participants did embrace existing immediately clear possibilities offered by the certain GDPs in the 3M starting design.

Another opportunity involved choice and design of game assets that allowed the expression of identity or a designed element - for example graphics, audio or a written message to appear at various stages of the game.

The incorporation and design of game assets is taken as work on GDP for the purpose of this model.

The core GDP involving game assets already exist in the starting template.
- Objects as a reward to incentivise player exploration
- Objects as a hazard penalising player progress

<!-- The choice of the starting toolset and mission shapes the balance and profile of initial community activity. -->
As explored in the literature review, the concept of a Microworld which embodies target concepts has extensive supporting and descriptive research.

This section outlines the characteristics of a game microworld which served as a base for learner's creations during the phase studies here.


### Observations on the use of code playgrounds and development tools

 -->

As explored in the previous chapter, my motivation for choice of code development tools (Javascript, Phaser and Glitch) were driven by desire to be authentic and extensible. In this section I draw on my journal notes and past experience and observations from interpretation of video data to share observations on the use of the coding environment.

The last chapter outlined the use and design characteristics of the starting game template, namely: an incomplete 2D platformer; pixel graphics; with graphical scaffolding for text-based code; and deliberately incomplete thus inviting improvement. This section addresses the impact of these characteristics on participant coding practices, based on video observations of learners.

THIS NEEDS REVISION - USEFUL BUT WHAT FOCUS - DEBUGGING TOOLS? - DESIGN HEURISTICS - LIKE SCRATCH

The use of glitch as a code playground significantly reduced technical barriers for students. It removing the process of setting up a server for web development, and the delay of transferring files to the server. While the code project consisted of several files of javascript, HTML and CSS, learners were shielded from the complexity of how they were interlinked and there were practically no extended blockages to undertaking work using this environment. There were some issues of access for some participants who did not remember or recall log in details or their project name. These issues were mitigated through the use of a log in details shared between participants.

When users struggled to log in or to find the games or assets that they had created earlier there sought and received help from family members or other peers. Direct help from facilitators was rarely required. In the glitch environment code errors were highlighted in with red dot in the interface which gave a quick visual indication of where the error occurred, when the user hovered over gave an error message as a pop up. the which while limited

### Impact of the half-baked starting template

In phase one, I noted that any addition to the game in terms of adding new any quantity of code created a many possible problems. To counter this I adapted the starting game template to allow changes in code were relatively easy to perform but which resulted in potentially large changes in game behaviour and appearance.

I initially highlighted these possible changes to the embedded game design patterns that could be made to existing code in person via informal instruction during pilot workshops. To facilitate working with larger groups, I later extended the process by creating supporting cards [^2] that highlighted and demonstrated the relevant code changes. While the code changes involved were minor in nature, they allowed a diversity in output to such an extent that participants were often kept occupied for an extended period of time. I kept the process informal and responsive by allowing participants to choose which one they wanted to work on next. The following sections outline different areas and patterns of activity.

<!-- COMMENT OF mOZILLA TOD THAT IT WAS GENTLE FACILITATION -->

<!-- - level design and prototyping: use of

<!-- These tools align with some key design considerations. [Brennan & Resnick]
 - Well suited to build a repeated design practice.

 - Variable changes needed immediate testing.  
 - Especially with starting documents, -->

<!-- While the design suits repeated design practice as illustrated by the example above, not all pairs or individuals interacted with GDP in such a neat way.
A later discussion section in this chapter illustrates a more complex interaction with design stages. -->

**Variable editing effective movement**

Player movement was a key to playtesting feedback as such three  key variables were highlighted at the very start of the game code and given descriptive names to facilitate their editing. When testing the game, the player's jump height was not great enough to allow progression up from the floor to one of the platform thus thwarting the collection of items.

Game progression require altering at least one of the descriptively names variables associated with jump height and then activating a preview window to observer the changes by playing the game in a new browser tab.
<!--FIND  Some evidence of building proficiency with significant work to change these three -->

    // Variables that change how the player moves
    var gravity = 500;
    var velocity_x = 100;
    var velocity_y = 300;

While some participants engaged with extensive experimentation to find a player movement feel that seemed just right, others were much less concerted with this aspect of game play, lowering gravity drastically to allow a greater jump size but a more frustrating floaty jump.

**Level design and prototyping**

The starting game template included a minimal amount of platforms, hazards to avoid and golden blocks to collect. The following image is of a printable _quick start_ cards to aid participants to begin the process of changing level design.
![](./Pictures/quickstart_phaser_1.png){width=50%}

The possibility of disturbing the syntax of the  of code in the array. When participant did this it provided a good opportunity for facilitators or parents to outline the importance of correct syntax of and to explain the code structure. The vignette in the last chapter saw Toby's adding new levels to his game and undertaking many iterations of changes to the level design. He and several other participants spent extensive time performing level design activity with a goal of making the game extremely challenging but still technically possible. Others played with the convention of the game by removing all hazards and filling the screen with rewards/coins (an example is outlined in the starting vignette of the next chapter).

**Incomplete graphical blocks to help seed narrative and art creativity**

The use of blank, coloured blocks of 32 x 32 pixels encouraged participants to change the graphical design and the relatively small size of the sprites encouraged rapid design. The theme of creating a game with moving characters often resulted in participants redesigning sprites to games involving animals. The following image shows a whale as a player character and plastic bottles.

![](./Pictures/whale_1.png){width=50%}

The process of creating a pixel art characters and hazard involved using an online grid design tool called Piskel, creating an design of an appropriate size, saving, exporting as an image, downloading to the hard drive of the laptop in use and finally uploading and incorporating the image into the code project and linking using code syntax.

#### Observations on design behaviours encouraged through use of game template

There was a great divergence in the amount of time learners took to want to progress beyond these changes to additional new game design patterns rather than altering the ones embedded in the starting template. The following chapter outlines this transition in greater detail.

When compared to the process of learning to code in a text language from first principles, knowledge of very few coding concepts were essential. In contrast, a large number of broader digital literacy skills involved. These include: file downloading ; file migration using the browser and file manager; browser tab navigation; graphics tool use in Piskel (a simplified Photoshop including - crop, fill and export tools); copying and paste text code; and selecting more than one lines of text code with mouse or keyboard shortcuts.

<!-- While the template has self contained help in the form of text comments Some participant do not pick up all processes, some left behind and need support but that is available. Seeing patterns other peers adopted and creates a reason to ask for help. Peer propagation of patterns explored later. -->

The process of swapping assets in involved developing a complex chain of many of the individual actions listed above. There was a large divergence in the speed and proficiency with which these processes were performed by participants. Some became remarkably adept at these processes and in doing so transformed these changes into a fluid operation. Learners who had mastered the skill were asked by others for help. The rapid adoption and transfer of these processes between community members indicated the high motivational factor for participants of incorporating self-created graphical elements. These motivational factors are explored in the following section.

## Emerging processes and use of tools

<!-- The process of facilitating for emerging learner identities and practices, via the processes and tools explored above,  -->

The chapter has until know discussed some of the uses of  processes and tools which as a designer I brought to the learning design

While these  tools and processes emerged in response to articulated and inferred learner need, the following process emerged more directly from input from the participants involved.  

One major process added in response to the requests of learners was that of adding game design patterns. This is covered in the following chapter.



<!-- Thus my role as a responsive facilitator rather than a instructor was key to this process.  -->
<!-- opens up flexibility in the way learners approach the design processes. -->
<!-- imagined, often in response to community need, by myself, the following emerged from community use. -->


### Emerging use of narratives and graphics which drawing on home funds of knowledge

While the potential to add graphics was a core affordence of the half-baked templated game, the process of designing and sharing and the peer commentary on the process emergered as the sessions evolved.

The literature review explored existing research on how the use of home interests and funds of knowledge facilitate the adoption of design and coding practices. At all phases of the learning design participants were able to input their own preferences in the narrative elements and themes of games. For example the choice of game characters allowed the expression of identity. Other designed elements for example audio effects or written messages were also possible.


One pair Clive and Pearl, the grandparents of Toby, included a narrative message at the start of their game. This process surfaced the expertise of the family as beekeepers, sparking interesting conversations with other participants.

     var starttext = "This is a game which pits a honey bee against a swarm of Asian hornets,  which are alien invaders attacking bee  hives in the UK and which beekeepers are trying to stop spreading  here. Try to guide the bee to collect all the flowers without being caught by the hornets.
     Use the arrow keys to move the bee. Press return to START.";



<!-- In a noteworthy exchange a young participant Zi asks one of the grandparents of child if they had done any amazing things in their life. This exchange follows

   zi: Have you done amazing things?

The exchange seems to throw Pa but they draw Zi's attention back to the game. Showing that it demonstrates their interest in bees as they are beekeepers.

The source of Pa's hesitancy to share more is not clear. However her willingness to share that part of her personal story via the narrative of the game is shown here as is the willingness of the young participant to ask about the personal experiences of the older participant during the process of peer testing her game. -->

In another example, Mark and Ed designed a game around the character of a train driver that needed to collect coal. In subsequent post course interview Mark describes the impact of the child feeling like they could bring their own identity and interest into the project. "I know just your eyes lit up when you realised you could expand your interests into gaming." See Appendix 4.x (Mark and Ed working with home interests)

<!-- NOTE
NARRATIVE / drama IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER?
how do these two sections work together? remove this one?

<!-- The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;] BRING ON OTHER LITERATURE HERE ON PERSONAL EXPRESSION, FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA. Roque, Scratch, Kafai, Gee etc. -->

<!-- Ideally look for evidence of sharing in communities, especially developing processes, avoiding traps which sap momentum, -->

<!-- While these aspects are covered in other literature, and are therefore not covered in depth in this chapter, it is important to include their strong presense in the data of study. And to situate them in relation to other chapter contents. HOW EXACTLY. -->

Other participants expressed pride over their graphical creations. In this excerpt parent Molly has spent time creating a pixel art representation of an alien. The full exchange (see appendix 4.x) sees Molly cultivating a sense of ownership over the graphical element that she has created. There is also the development of a growing sense of competency in this area of asset design. She notes she is an "expert pixel".

    Molly: We’re finished.  Right what’s next? Now I’m an expert pixel? Now I have to figure out how to get it in there, don’t I? Without losing it. I’ll be very upset.
    Sonia: Have you saved it?
    Molly: No I’ve not saved it.
    Sonia: Save there. (points to relevant button on screen)

The growing mastery of this area also seems to help drive motivation to complete the next challenge. The sense of ownership spurs the technical process of saving projects. Her pride in her work and concern surrounding losing it provokes a fellow parent to show her how to save her work.

#### Summary: Home Funds and RQs

This research supports fiding of other research which highlight value of games and media projects to incorporate home funds [Resnick , Scratch]. It also aligns with PBL literature which advocates the personalisation of projects [find a nice one].

The use of home funds of knowlege as a tactic by facilitators can be highly motivating in early stages of the design process and sustain the coding activity to overcome problems to share the personalised object created.

The tacit knowledge of children as proficient consumers of games gives them agency in the process of feeding back.

There is evidence here that frictions involved in dealing with expectations, are helped by the use of a templated game which has an implied narrative and creative frame which scaffolds the initial creative process. (like a core musical style from which to jam from, or provided constraints in a drama process which help guide improvisation.)
This shifts the focus of the microworld concept away from emboddied STEM concepts, often maths or computing concepts, to provide a base for creative expression.


<!-- While, the personal expression via narrative and asset design can be engage and sustain the motivation of participants, these processes brought tensions identified in the _design chapter_ namely: (edit down into list? ) -->

<!-- **Exploring Tension - time spent on task - ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**
Take the example above, through use of pixel art editor, and template with small, retro themed graphics, as a designer, reduce the propensity to spend along time on asset creation as retro pixel art is quicker to make. -->

<!-- **Expectations- ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**

- incorporating familiar or personally meaningful elements can involve challenges including that of unrealistic expectations based on previous game playing experiences -->


### Playtesting

 <!-- NOTE - Include examples here which do not talk of GDP explicitly - but other cultural aspects. -->

As explored in the literature review and previous chapter, playtesting is a rich and varied learning opportunities which encourages community-building behaviour. By the time video data recording started in phase three there were already complex patterns of playtesting underway. In this section, I review data to describe some of the emerging playtesting behaviours of participants.

**Playtesting as a social process**

Participants, particularly older ones, used playtesting as a way of showing support for fellow game makers. Example behaviours included: praising graphical content; making links with home interests of participants through questioning; and building rapport. For example, if a game featured an image of a dog other participants may ask: _Do you like dogs? Do you have a dog at home?_.

**Playtesting and embodied participation in the games of others**

By the time phase three and video capture of data was underway, the process of playtesting began to take on interesting characteristics for some younger participants who were working more independently.

Playtesting took on additional playful elements often staring in one part of the working environment and then migrating to other areas. Because of this mobility is it hard to transcribe interactions. However, description of the physical movement and gestures of the young people is relevant to explore the value of this behaviour which I will call playful playtesting. It is possible to communicate the characteristics of this play via a description of a typical encounter.


 <!-- Examples include.... -->
Play is initiated by calling across the room as an invitation to play, or as a provocation. When playtesting is underway it is normally undertaken with two or three participants standing around the computer rather than being seated. The core of those involved take turns to play the game, exclaiming frustration or triumph at completing levels or failing. Failure may be extremely performative with a rapid pulling way from the screen and keyboard. This may be followed with a battle to wrestle control of the keyboard to play the game next. This may involving playful pushing, and wrestling of hands and arms and vocalisations.

While this play is happening it may attract other participants who may  remain on outskirts of the activity looking on able to watch what is happening on the screen and respond non-verbally with smiles or laughs.

<!-- There may have been a response to draw in one of the younger participants who had on parent partner and who was brought along by another parent. -->

<!-- NOTE - Nadine's play on secret missions mirrors some of her more spontaneous play in the previous phase - thus one informs other -->


**Community concepts and norming behaviour emerging during playtesting**

THERE IS DOUBLICATION WITH NEXT CHAPTER - REEVALUATE / REFACTOR - ESP CONCEPT OF SAFE ZONE


Participants concepts of game challenge evolved through informal feedback during playtesting and served to influence peers to modify their games to increase the enjoyment of peer players. The discussion of game challenge, specifically comment about how 'hard' participant games were the most common interaction during playtesting.

This concept of the feel of the game or the challenges maps to the Dynamics of MDA framework.

<!-- The concept of difficulty for most of the participant's games was dependent on the interaction between the feel of the game controls and elements of game challenge associated with placement of hazards and moving enemies. -->

<!-- The term _game feel_  has varied interpretation but is generally framed as the responsiveness and feeling of control over the main character during the core movement of the game. In this case, it effects the ability of players to move between platforms and avoid enemies. In this design the jump mechanic is determined by the use of variables controlling gravity, jump velocity and movement velocity. -->

<!-- The importance of these variables to is was behind the design decision to place these variable right at the top of the code and to rename them with player centric names rather than mathematical terms like velocity and acceleration.   -->

<!-- NOTE - BE SURE TO EXPLORE THIS IN SOME DETAIL IN DESIGN CHAPTER -->

<!-- The regular playtesting of games allowed participants to give each other feedback regularly and game feel was one of the aspects that young people in particular to gave frequent feedback on. -->

<!-- Parent Mi had been focused mostly on completing asset design. She had been made aware by her daughter Ne about the relevant game variables. -->
<!-- In response, Mi asked for advice but Ne gave none walking away. Mi noted "She's left me to my own devices."

Player jump (y) velocity was set very high but left right (x) velocity was slow. This created a very frustrating game feel. The following is a compilation of feedback comments or reactions over a 15 minute time period.   

    Mi: (Talking to self) No! It's so hard that. (referring to a particular jump in her game.)
    Mick: How are you getting on Mi? It's looking good.
    Mick: (Noting frustrated air of Mi) Have you made it to hard.
    Mi: I don't know. Can you jump from here to here with this.. this.. him? (point to main character)
    Mick: So it look like you bump your head and fall down.
    Mick: One bit of friendly feedback that I would give you is that it's taking a long time to move left and right. And that is something that you can change if you want to.
    Mi: Oh right yeah.direct
    Mick: Yeah.
    Mi: Yeah, actually that's a good idea.
    Mick: If you think about average games. Your average jump time would be about one second in the air. So that can be a bit of guide sometimes.   -->

 <!-- The only changes she had made to the deliberately frustrating initial player movement (discussed in design chapter) was to change player jump velocity. Player jump (y) velocity was set very high but left right (x) velocity was slow.  -->

<!-- She had been made aware by her daughter Ne about the relevant game variables.
In response, Mi asked for advice but Ne gave none walking away. Mi noted "She's left me to my own devices." -->

Parent Molly had been focused mostly on completing asset design this had created a very frustrating game experience in terms of the player's movement. As a facilitator, I shared feedback about using quite indirect technical language when giving feedback (See appendix 4.x). Younger participants are more direct.

    Bertie: That looks nice (referring to the graphical look of the game)

    Molly invites Bertie: to play as she can't progress due to the difficult game controls.

    Bertie: It jumps super high but so slow  
    Pause
    Molly: He has to go slow because he's an astronaut, you see.    
    Bertie: It's hard.
    (Bertie leaves.)
    Molly: (to peer parent with proud tone.) It's hard. Wow.

    (Ed comes to play the game)
    Ed: How much jump speed to you have?
    Ed: Your jump speed is massive.

Mi initially misconstrue the feedback that her game is hard as a positive thing. Other children come and play the game but only for less than a minute before leaving. While their feedback is non verbal the very short length of time that some of them spend is noticeable.  After the last one leaves Mi comments "It's so frustrating." This suggests that through he process she understands her game is frustrating rather than pleasantly challenging.

A variety of comments suggest comply with an emerging community norm of what a sensible jump behaviour should be. Feedback from Mick attempts to bridge a technical and conversational approach, direct feedback from Ch and then a more specifically technical explanation from  involving the naming of the variable _jump speed_.

#### Agency vs Community - Agency with an evolving community

These norming behaviours some of the informal norming behaviours that are less directive seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues as explored in literature review [@rogoff_cultural_2003].

EXPLORE THIS IN RELATION TO RESEARCH - AND PERHAPS SHIFT TO LATER DISCUSSION

#### Summary Playtesing and RQs

Playtesing provides many leverage points facilitating learner agency:

- playtesting as a way to show informed criticality as a player and guide the creations of peers via gameplay feedback
-  

<!-- We can see that Mi justifies the game feel of a very high fast jump with a narrative response about the character being spaceman. However, the limited amount of time anyone plays her game and her own frustration in playing it is telling. The game feel is frustrating in the wrong way here. Mi seems to initially misconstrue the feedback she is getting here equating her ability to make the game hard as a positive thing. However, towards the end she notes the frustrating nature of the game.

Other children come and play the game but only for less than a minute before leaving. While their feedback is non verbal the very short length of time that some of them spend is noticeable.  After the last one leaves Mi comments "It's so frustrating." In these interactions we can see a consistent message coming from peers in the playtesting process. They praise the look of the game but offer constructive feedback to help improve the GDP of jumping.

While the players do not tell Mi directly to change the game, these comments appear to direct direction of the design to comply with an emerging community norm of jump feel stemming from the personal experiences of the participants and from tangible feeling of lack of control over the player's character in the game. The same message is delivered in a variety of ways, above we can see feedback from Mick trying to bridge a technical and conversational approach, direct feedback of the personal challenge level and an interpretation of the cause from Ch and then a more specifically technical explanation involving the naming of the variable _jump speed_. -->

<!-- These norming behaviours some of the informal norming behaviours that are less directive seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues as explored in literature review [@rogoff_cultural_2003]. -->


<!-- NOTE - NOTES ON THE CULTURE OF HARDNESSS - FIT IN SOMEWHERE IF APPROPRIATE

When explored from game making perspective the hard is good lens, is limiting in terms of building the engagement of players. However, culturally the desire to make games hard for other participants is more understandable in the context of retro games. .

- arcade games were designed to be hard to extract money from players
- nes games reputation for being brutal as they often had no way to save states, and much of the games challenge, due to limitations of number of levels or modes of playing, depended on this 'hardness'
- this developed later for snes games , finding challenge and other forms of ways of maintaining interest for different genres of games_
- retro games are associated therefore with being brutal and frustrating.
- thus in some ways the process of making a hard game is a way of getting your own back at all the games that have frustrated

### Building Identities as Game Makers  - EXTENDED

PARK THIS FOR NOW IN DESIGN CHAPER

COULD RETURN TO THIS IN A DISCUSSION CHAPTER - AS HAS IMPACT ON GDP TOO.

My journal notes see an evolution of attempts to try to build into the program, activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers or more generally digital designers. In and early tentative attempt to define in broad strokes the types of game maker behaviour and underlying goals. In doing this I have taken inspiration from Bartle's game player types Hamari and Tuunanen, 2014). I translated player types to maker types based on notes in my observation journal and extracts from screen capture data. The following list of *Game Maker *types:

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users


My journal notes see an evolution of attempts to try to build into the program, activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers or more generally digital designers.

-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

For examples in the Vignette of S and T's interaction we can see attributes of the child as a Glitcher. In terms of understanding of the game as a dynamic system, this is seen clearly in the parent's alarm at the child's deletion of all elements of hazard. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. "It's no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid." The child seems determined to remove all hazards. My understanding is that she is also aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play. They seem to take pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context. The process mirrors play theory concept of playing against the game or dark play Sutton-smith, 2001).

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with the positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you. -->

ALSO DUPLICATION WITH NEXT CHAPTER - SO REFACTOR

An additional fund which participant drew on in the design process was their home collaboration practices.

#### Alternating coding

The parent cedes the keyboard and mouse and sometimes swaps chairs to allow child to play test the game created.  One parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles."

The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

#### Shifting roles in partner work

At one point the testing process Suzanna shows frustration as gravity value is very low making any movement very slow with little control. While the child has previously rejected increasing the value, the parent's initial acceptance of this decision is later questioned. The parent who has to do the majority of the testing is more insistent to remove a frustrating part of the testing  process.  

<!-- Discussion drawing on more radical attempts to describe the best way to bring young learners into a design practice.
Perhaps in the field of participatory design. -->


Toby and Dan's pair process of using supporting documents here as they work shows similar shifts. The professional practices of accessing professional documentation involves cultural elements here of a family learning culture between these two playing out in these processes. Toby and Dan's design process is more guided and focused than many other participants. As this interchange exploring professional documentation resources continues, the father starts as a facilitator  taking a lead from the direction of the child. However, as the dialogue progresses he begins to be more directive, initially by asking leading questions and testing existing knowledge. Finally, in order to complete the research task after reaching the beyond of the child's knowledge, the father issues a series of more direct instruction, directing the research and proposing a coding solution for their new game design pattern.

This approach appears to be influenced by Dan's experience as a software engineer and volunteer at Coder Dojo (Glossary). Interview extracts (included as appendices) show a direction to support the novices direction as a facilitator where possible.

    I try never to touch the keyboard of who's there. If they are stuck on something I always tell them what to do. Even if it's then taken me five minutes to explain what a semicolon is. And point. It's that key. Because it was just, I could do it so effortlessly. I think I'm sure I put people off very quickly by "Dave did something really quickly. I don't know what it was.".

This extract from interview data indicates a priority to support the learner to develop independently but to still be very present in the support process.

#### Helpers supporting supportive community behaviours

While not a key part of this study, it is of value to briefly examine the role of student helpers in this phase.
One of their remits was to support the work of participants and to guide reflection by asking simple questions like "What have you been working on?", What are you working on now. What do you want to add to your game. Beyond this, students also gave feedback between playtestings sessions, connected different participants, supported parental behaviours,   into the design process via debriefing sessions. In journal notes I made observations and gathered feedback, while not fo extensively studied there is potential here.
Especialy in the potential to replicate family supportive behaviours with non-expert facilitators in a volunteering settings, specifically with bespoke guidance to support game making.
DEVELOP IN RELATION TO DISUCSSION BELOW.

### The potential of "non-productive" activity (faff-time and digital laundry)

Much time in sessions was spent on activities outside of the established design stages. For example, opening up the right tools, navigating to correct locations and finding past assets involved a fair deal of effort and collaboration. For example the  migrating assets between authoring tools, converting to correct formats, evaluating new tools, and finding previously created assets. These are practices that I am personally familiar with. I call them digital laundry or digital housekeeping. Things that at times can be low attention span. Faff time is even less productive switching on the computer and waiting for the internet to connect, waiting for a family member to finish their rushed lunch or navigating to the right location in creative software.

 <!-- I have been pragmatic and map elements like this these loosely. Where appropriate I make notes on that activity in free form areas of other documents like spreadsheets. -->
 <!-- This limits claims I can make from the coded data. However it raises interesting points which merit discussion. -->


Skills to perform these activities were at often distributed between different family members. For some adult re-enforcing their identities as project managers, and for young participants forming identities as digital specialists. I noted in analysis of data that along with frustration there are also moments of creativity, and there are bonding moments which appear to be helped by this activity which is at times quite unfocused but also shared.

In retrospect, many of the social and secret missions encouraged activity outside of established design stages. For example the lively discussion about game playing in response to the mission to _find out the favourite games of 3 other people_. The process of swapping graphical assets used a shared Piskel gallery and games area which served to keep individuals informed in directly of progress being made, and to spark curiosity in the creations of others.

I observed that navigating these essential but non-creative tasks in a collaborative and playful way helps maintain a positive affect to the overall creative digital process. This observation is supported by an example in the next chapter  available in appendix 5.x - and extract of which is included below.

   Molly: How did you do that so quickly? I’ve got to like, carefully... (makes hand gestures to show a sense of hesitant keyboard use)
   Parent peer laughs
   Nadine bounces up in place and smiles broadly.

Thus it is of potential value to learn to value the potential of these liminal moments between design spaces for participants and facilitators alike.


#### Summary: Division of Labour and RQs

It is hard to make general claims in this area because of the context of the participants as families involved in home education. However, many of the observations.  similar practices exist in other research in this domain. For example, children have the potential to help parents as technology brokers [@correa_brokering_2015].  And parents can fulfil several valid roles including, advocate, emotional support, etc [@barron_parents_2009]

Thus, it is not contraversial to suggest that parents and siblings can provide a large form of support in the creative process and that facilitators can design learning environments to facilitatte these possibilities. And that research on the roles that they provide can be of use to facilitators to advance their work. The work of Roque on FCL provided guidance for helpers in the process to support parents to value and feel confident these roles [@roque_im_2016] in a way which mirrors the use of helpers this phase of my study.

Highlighting and supporting these more naturally emerging roles  behaviours may be more useful  (explain - well aligned to creating a game making community?) to facilitators in informal environments that the more prescriptive roles in pedagogies like pair programming.


<!--
#### Code roles  and experimentation

While the parents are the ones doing the majority of the heavily lifting importing new code, children are observering and emulating this behaviour.

In one interaction child Ne visits the page to add a mechanic, starts to scan it, highlights some code, but then seems to change her mind
- perhaps recognising limits - or fearing the process of breaking her game - and returns to more familiar territory of changing game assets and level design.

<!-- ### On different kinds of snags / blockages

PERHAPS MOVE BACK TO THE GDP CHAPTER IF SPACE?

#### On Debugging and Embracing Different Types of Errors

In analysis of journal notes and recorded screens I began to identify different kinds of problems that blocked participants from progressing. I refer to different kinds of blockages which result from tensions and contradictions between different elements in activity systems.

Some blockages were non-technical including hunger or grumpyness between participants, others were due to lack of access to the right tools or understanding of processes, others were particular types of coding error. I propose that more granular understanding  of different kinds of design blocks can help facilitators and ultimately learners in building agency in their response to them.

For example,  on into the detail and types or errors.  These include:

 -   **Syntax and Program Errors** are errors in your code which stop the game from functioning at all, often resulting in a blank screen.
 -   **No Behaviour Bugs** are errors which in your code which don't stop the game from functioning but your intended effect is not present when it should be.
 -   **Glitches** don't stop your game from running but as you play you see that there is an unintended effect. The game does something different from what we want it to do.
 -->

<!-- #### Examples of Glitch types of errors

Short examples of different types and the affect implications.

Glitch errors can be productive.

**Productive in exploring code / creating new game opportunites**
An interesting one where the x / y axis mix up for Te 2019-03-18 leads to a new challenge in the game.

**Productive in in**

- Glitch - 2019-05-08 - Te and Da  - create moving enemy but it totally leaves the screen. This caused amusement and participants knew how they thought they would follow that up.

 The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful. -->

 <!-- As mentioned in the previous sections, after analysis of this vignette in particular, it seemed promising to investigate behaviour and engagement at different stages of design process for this pair. To do this I have made extensive notes and used a coding structure for two complete sessions of this parent-child pair. The following observations have been made by comparing the codes on stages of design and types of participant interaction. This data was then triangulated participant feedback and my own journal notes. The observations are presented themed by the design stages used in the coding process with some general observations listed at the end of this section. -->

<!-- #### Discussion on design stages and GDP for this pair - DROP THIS?

 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.
 This parent was much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents. The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker/player type (concepts explored in previous chapter). This interpretation seems confirmed by less social interactions compared to may parents. The pair engaged far less in play testing of other games and peer support to overcome barriers. They also followed the stages of design more closely than may other groupings, an observation which is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

 This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." This alternation is driven or facilitated by the different stages of implementing GDPs. The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

 Using the coded data from nvivo to compare design cycle stages with pair collaboration, it can be observed that the most likely stages for pair collaboration were during the Ask/Imagine stage, Testing and Planning.

 The vignette shows evidence of that the actions of the parent to re-engage the child at different stages of the design cycle helped sustain the child's engagement in the more focused design process happening on the screen. However, an opposing pattern of behaviour may also be valid. When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups. Within Rogoff's model of community of learners [-@rogoff_developing_1994], this observation is viewed as valid form of participation. The child's ability to legitimately disengage from pair coding to observe the work and interactions of others in this emerging community of learners may also be sustaining.

 It is of note that when describing the design cycle for this family that this family along with others are working with decomposed smaller design challenges in the form of implementing GDPs. Thus the cycle is repeated for each new pattern that the pair take on. These smaller design iterations can be expressed within the framework of AT as an activity system. -->

 <!-- #### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

 NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION?
  NOTE - This more general observation may be part of the previous chapter

 We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

 - The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
 - This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

 Discussion

 - The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

 The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity. -->

## Discussion

<!-- ## Discussion on designing for learner agency -->
<!-- I propose that learner agency entails the practice of designing and facilitating effective and engaging creative and technical learning environments.  -->

<!-- This chapter has explored the affordances and potential of selected tools and processes in the context of in-person, family-based, game coding. As explored previously the literature on design for face-to-face communities which encourages community members to develop their own practices is sparse. -->

This section begins to explore observations in line with conceptions of authenticity and agency and other studies, identify processes to to aid researchers / practitioners replicate practice and understandings of the process.


<!-- I will extract observations from this research that extend beyond the process of coding into other domains.   -->

In this secdtion analysis uses the language and concepts introduces in literature on affordances and transformational agency which in turn draws on concepts of conflicts in activity in activity theory.

Recap of affordances and anchors:

In research on practice, other researchers have found the the scope and focus of affordances important to clarify [@wolff-piggott_activity_2016].  


While there is a The wealth of HCI literature in line with activity which discusses and applies concetps of affordances, the focus is often on the individual rather than on collective action [@kaptelinin_affordances_2012].

Extending the metaphor of an kedging anchour used to warp a boat.

Affordances can act as visible anchor points, much like the coloured climbing holds in a climbing wall. To aid learners agency, designers add explicit anchor points to the design and make them visible to learners. (aligning with instrumental agency)

In the design above such anchor points may be regular play-tesing, the highlighting of external audiences,  the use of documentation, the embedding of quick variable and structural changes.

Some processes work to clarify problems areas, thus making the water clearer to better see anchour points

Similarly, as the process unfold the faciliator may see learners repeatedly run into the same obstacle and not be able to see the anchor points available to them. Perhaps even catching onto snags or other debris, false anchor points.

The job of the designer is then then  to identify the mud in teh water, to stay in the sheltered water of a harbour.
The harbour metaphor is like walled garden.

Many design decisions were made for this purpose in the first phase of the design. For example, using an online code playground instead of a local broswer and code editing tool, hiding away the html and css files in the use of the code playground , pulling up the key variables of the movement mechanics to the top of the js file.

The process is not just technical.


This my be done by
- defining or reducing the use use of specialised terminology  or
- hiding away un-needed complexity.
- signposting issues like a lighthouse or similar big thing on a rock - don't go there  
- imagining the lines of sight of the learner. try to remove large obstacles to potential anchour points.


Of course this may make learners run into trouble if engaging outside of the harbour or in real situtations.

Thus, whilst both of value, there is a potential tension between instrumental agency and transformative agency. In designing out tensions it reduces the capacity for participants to solve them both individually and collectively by .

When designing with learner agency in mind. Soem of the following may help using this metaphor



<!-- The use of double stimuli by larger groups of participants to break out of contradictions in activity and thus further their agency is conceptualised by Sannino in TADS [@sannino_principle_2015] -->

### Discussion on authenticity and agency

<!-- #### Authenticity of Problem / Project

Well established in PBL.
Here the challenge is make a game to share, thus well aligned. -->


Researchers state authenticity in PBL should apply to tools and processes as well as problem [@hung_engaged_2006]. WHY?

One key consideration is the authenticity of the tools involved.

 MOVED SOME TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER

While Heathcote often explored issues in the context of making of the workplace through replicating working models of practice, she warns against asking participants to genuinely make items in the process explored. To do so, she argues, would expose their inexpertness in the cold light of day. This is uncovered in an interview extract from Bolton and Heathcote.

> "if they are makers of things (for example, shoes, ballgowns, or aircraft) they _must never_ (within the fiction, that is) _be asked to create the actual objects_. If they had to do this their _in_ expertness would become immediately apparent."[@heathcote_drama_1994, p. 18]

<!-- In the learning environment of this study there are broad similarities and some key differences in terms of supporting tools and processes. -->

<!-- NOTE ADD SOME DETAIL detail

<!-- For example in this iteration, x is authentic, -->


Heathcote highlighted the value and dangers of authentic tools and processes in settings where students may find their novice skills frustrating and thus reduce feelings of agency.

EXPLORE WHY BRIEFLY IN RELATION TO AGENCY AND LAST CHAPTER.

The last chapter explored authenticity of tools and processes and resulting tensions in more general terms.

It is worth reexamining the impact of authenticity briefly for participants

The authentic goal of making a game acted as a wrapper for the whole process, with norming behaviours and embedded knowledge guiding people within bounds implicitly without excessive instruction. Playtesting being informed by existing experience. Very effective and a reason it is often chosen probably.

There are examples of the authenticity of the audience being used by participants
- Suzanna uses the imagined audience to norm behaviour.
- Olivia (Th) imagines the impact of her game on real students as a motivational factor and one which drives design decisions.

The inspirational factor of _lifting the lid_ on previously unknown technology was reflected in a conversation among participants communicating a sense of awe of how much code must be involved in a professional game based on the relative complexity of the code of their simple game.

The use of authentic tools and processes, while challenging for novices, can be facilitated by careful alignment of key design principles.

#### Creating affordances within the (Microworld) design

THIS PERHAPS LIVES IN THE AUTHENTICITY OF TOOLS SECTION

One of the key elements of engagement and affordances providing agency was the embodied choices offered in the game template.

While, initially conceived as a starting activity, many learners stuck with those possibilities for a long period of time.

The embodied elements allowed access to agency via expression of home interests, play with dynamics, game layout,
ANCHOR METAPHIR

The partially working environment and immediate feedback this allowed also gave rapid access access to varied forms of face to face community activity including varied forms of playtesting and social interaction and ways to access help from peers and facilitators.

The next stage was to imagine game elements to add to the design in the form of GDPs.
The next chapter explores the use of GDPs by participants in detail using varied data.

This invites further work to explore on the value of drama processes to act as a bridge to cover the gap between novice skills and the value of engaging in practices in a realistic a way as  possible.

<!-- #### Analysis against (and calls to heed) existing design heuristics

Earlier we examined of challenges of the authenticity of the authentic tools set consisting of js, phaser, html, and a code-playround.

The complexity of coding and the resulting challenges of learning to code has yield much research on guidance in the process of designing toolsets to support novice coders [@resnick_reflections_2005] - (find others on the evolution of LOGO).  

The user-friendly design heuristics of  low-thresholds, wide-walls, high-ceilings - extended by Kafai and Burke to include open windows - can be used to evaluate this design and other designs.  

NOTE - ADD KEY DETAILS OF THE ACCESSIBILITY / CHALLENGE OF THE CORE TOOLS SET

In this design the tools set is disctinct from tools like scratch which are self-contained to a large degree (while interacting with a website)

The online only nature of the toolset does facilitate certain aspects of community participation by shifting the working space away from a desktop only environment, this facilitating some sharing by default. This was picked up on by the community as they viewed each others assets and playtested games.

Indeed, Scratch itself has moved to a web-bsaed online by default process in the lifespan of this research.  

**Summary:** These heuristics provide a useful tool for designers and practitioners supporting creative coding activities. -->




Of course this may make learners run into trouble if engaging outside of the harbour or in real situtations.

Thus, whilst both of value, there is a potential tension between instrumental agency and transformative agency. In designing out tensions it reduces the capacity for participants to solve them both individually and collectively by .

When designing with learner agency in mind. Soem of the following may help using this metaphor

#### Summary

The use of authentic tools and processes, while challenging for novices, can be facilitated by careful alignment of key design principles.

<!-- The drama process aligns with particularly the use of a playful, fictional absent character called the Golem or Wizard that both young people and adults collude to keep real.  some of the aspects of the 5th Dimension project [@blunden2014seeking] [@blanton_effects_1997]   -->

<!-- The  marshalling towards certain goals to maintain a shared script / experience. -->

<!-- In Papert's [-@papert_gears_1980] study of his childhood play with gears he celebrated the joy of understanding processes hidden from others by taking apart and playing with technology.  -->


### Discussion on and agency and use of drama process

TRANSISION - AUTHENCITY IN DRAMA PROCESS

#### Positive affective space

The work here of creating and coding in role and creating a playful context and language mirrors work done in learning languages to reduce learner anxiety by leveraging the potential for drama processes to create positive "affective spaces".  [@piazzoli_process_2011; @stinson_dol_2006].
PERHAPS MOVE THIS UP OR TO LIT REVIEW - ALSO THE TERM AFFECTIVE SPACE IS NOT WIDELY USED - FIND PARALLEL IN MOE

The drama process can be viewed as magic circle [@stenros_defence_2012]. A magic circle is a concept which transmits the idea that game players enter a loosely bounded play space where they accept arbitrary play rules and enter a social contact to adopt a playful attitude. I previously made observations on myself and participants being more comfortable performing some of the activities in role. This feeling may stem from being positioned together with participants within a playful agreement. Other processes beyond social and secret missions were completed in role namely; the wider mission of making a game; the end reflection sessions; and guiding participants in the use of supporting documentation.  

<!-- This section aims to explore these observations paying particular attention to their value in the context of computer coding and using AT as a frame. -->

The positive affective space can also reduce facilitator stress. In my journal notes, I observed, that when listing boundaries to activities within role, it felt similar to outlining the rules of a game rather that constricting their behaviour. Thus less about controlling individuals and more about contracting into a game-ful or playful experience. I felt more relaxed restricting choice in role via the proxy of a playful encounter.

I believe part of my hesitancy in shifting activity from participant-led game making to reflection, or accessing documentation, stemmed from worrying that the learners would also find this shift in objective, from the organically developing design and play testing activity system to an externally imposed system of reflecting on progress, would be jarring, potentially disorientating and reduce learner engagement and positive affect towards the overall process. In other words, provoking a feeling that the fun's over, it's back to school.

I propose that the drama fiction eases friction between competing activity system objectives. For example, Heathcote refers to curricula content as an example of object interests, e.g. exploring detail in history, geography and writing accurately or with expression. Heathcote posits that learners especially those resistant to authoritarian teaching techniques, appreciate the effort of the facilitator in aligning "needs interests" to "object interests" [-@heathcote_dorothy_1984, p. 185], arguing that it can create a generosity of spirit on the part of learners.

#### Supporting Digital Jamming

Because of the common use of design stages as a conceptual design tool.
And a prevalence of research linking design thinking  stages  and coding. I coded data to that. When coding data a design cycle framework was one of the code structures. Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share. However, when coding I quick became aware that naturalistic practice rarely matched the progression of the design cycle. The stages were instead fragmented and sometimes happened in parallel. In many interactions I observed improvisational approaches which incorporated ideation, planning, implementation and testing in space of a minute or so.

I propose that the tools, process and the community in this study mutually encourage an improvisational approach often referred to as jamming. Jamming, a term common in music and theatre, describes responsive, improvised, rapid and fluid responses to collaborators ideas and audience reactions [@pinheiro2011creative; @sawyer_group_2003].

Such behaviour is often present in recorded data. Younger participants also developed impressively fluid practice demonstrating extremely rapids shifts between code editing, game testing, authoring assets in online tools and migrating files often while talking with peers. Older participants also showed fluid practice. Clive quickly incorporated a boost to player health after a level after being given feedback during playtesting. In exploring sound making software Ed and Mark start a process of tinkering and messing about which spurs creativity. The joint jamming then has created two different soundtracks. This sparks a new thought to create different soundtracks for different levels. Other pairs often adopt a similar spirit. For example parent Dan makes a suggestion - "Use paper to design?" - to which Toby replies "I'm just going with it."

While, the process of jamming is put into practice in this domain partially via accelerated events encouraging collaboration and innovation called Game Jams, these events are inconsistent and opaque in the way they may support improvisational approaches [@goddard_playful_2014].

Similar to limits of the writing cycle in teaching [@kuby_rhizomatic_2016]

Other more chaotic perspectives on creative processes exist including rhizomatic approaches [@de_freitas_classroom_2012]. And some attempts have been made to incorporate design thinking with a rhizomatic approach [@biffi_chasing_2017-1].


### Creating space for emergent design practices can support agency

<!-- NOTE - discuss the value of design stages? from PBL chapter -
It would be vital to include this in Lit Review -->

A suitable context for create jamming here aligns with conceptions of affective space previously explored in drama process conditions.

While some areas of the design emerged in phase one, became a stable part of the design, (for example template and supporting documentation) other processes remained more flexible to interpretation and direction by participants; , playtesting, division of labour and use of home interests.  

To encourage broad possibilities of learner agency key areas of the design should not be overly structured. I propose that if you leave space for emergent practices they will emerge.

While this has tricky implications for practitioners in more formal settings, there are tactics and tools which can help.  

DEVELOP THE ABOVE AS A SUMMARY OF THE PREVIOUS STAGES


<!-- While design cycles was not an explicitly part of the game making instruction, certain interventions supported this approach. In particular the use of maps as a planning and reflection tool and the use of playtesting as a social and personal form of evaluation of emerging designs. -->
<!--

For example when altering jump and move variable for the first time. They are deliberately set low. Thus while technically this is improving the code. As the participant is meeting those variable for the first time we can recategorise in the create category.

<!-- #### Designing to incorporate learner identity

NOTE - INCLUDE HOME ED CONTEXT TO AN EXTENT TO PRECEED LATER CAVEATS IN CONCLUSION

Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].

This chapter supports this research and also finds game making as  a suitable medium to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

Conceptually, within AT, these interventions and design choices which yield possibilities for self-exploration can be see as potential anchor points to increase learner agency.

In summary:

Family game making, of completing projects together with your parents or siblings has potential to remove the **I'm not that sort of person** barrier of cultural identity as participants are surrounded by their people.

  - the choice of retro games as a medium provokes sharing for older participants while their enduring popularity maintains common ground with younger participants;

## Conclusion

MAKE THIS TIGHTER -

In making design decisions, I am balancing here many different factors of concern in the complex learning environment. These include; authenticity of programming environment and language, use of the existing structure of the phaser library, the learning process of participants getting stuck and having to resolve tensions, my time limits providing individual support as a facilitator of a group, and the patience of participants when they encounter incomplete documentation.

A relevant challenge is the difficulty of structuring resources in a way which can support the diversity of the directions in which participant want to progress their design. Drawing from authentic resources can be chaotic and create problematic errors.

Participants may also lack the concepts of computing and necessary language needed to find external support materials easily. Some of these challenges are potentially addressed through the combination of possibilities of the starting and a selection of curated code examples.  The next chapter explores the use of a collection of game design patterns to help address these issues.






<!-- This chapter was organised in part around starting processes and practices and tool use which  emerged from this starting point. This distinction is fluid as some tools and processes which emerged in community practice, prove to be successful and which are then adopted as a suggested process for the next iteration of the design.

We can note tension of restricting user choice in order to create more "visible anchor points" to increase potential for increasing the agency of learners. Like swimming in a protected pool rather than in the sea. This tension is explored more in following chapter.

This chapter has addressed x, the next chapter takes a deeper look at the mechanics of implementing code elements. -->
