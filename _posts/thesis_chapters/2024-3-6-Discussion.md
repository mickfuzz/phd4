## Research Questions - April 2024

~1. What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to participation in game coding processes?~
1. What ~barriers~ contradictions arose in participation in this research's game coding processes and what pedagogical tools and processes are available to address these contradictions?
2. How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?
3. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?



## Introduction

This chapter explores the development of the emerging game making through the lens of the cultural and community activity.

<!-- The chapters have until now discussed tools and processes emerged in response to inferred learner need, in contrast, the processes explored in this following section emerged more directly from input from the participants involved.   -->


### Notes on structure of the chapter

<!-- COMMENT - While there is an overarching theme of, there is still a fair bit of work to do to make the structure of this chapter coherent. -->

The guiding direction of this chapter is on how participants use the created and emerging cultural tools of this game making program, particularly in reference to the building of agency? Thus mostly addressing RQ4. However to do this, the chapter builds on the work of previous chapters and in doing so discusses aspects of all three research questions.

The first section explores the community behaviour of the group of game makers and some of the specifics of their design processes. The processes include: emerging use of narratives and graphics which drawing on home funds of knowledge; playtesting as a social process; play testing and embodied participation in the games of others; community concepts and norming behaviour emerging during playtesting; the development of flexible divisions of labour;

The chapter then continues the work on chapter five by discussion the emergence of flexible and complex design behaviours.

A discussion follows which deepens the analysis in chapter four detailed and overall design context, tensions and evolution of tool use. Particular attention is givent to the implications of design decisions and scaffolding approaches to tool use. It also begins to ask questions about the possible application of this approach to classroom contexts.

The chapter ends with a discussion on wider concerns of designing for learner agency. Here I synthesise analysis on processes which support learners to develop agency in this game making community and the role of different levels of authenticity.

<!-- _How does this fit into other findings chapters?_

Chap 4 - overall design context / evolution - Then in greater detail on personal observations on the evolutions and impact of the templated game approach and scaffolding of the code design. (not GDPs)

Chap 5 - zoom out in scale to main focus of the activity as communicated between participants and their impact and appropriation by participants. It

Chap 6 - zoom out in scale to cultural tools and their impact and appropriation by participants. It -->







<!-- Inspired by Heathcote, the importance and challenges of authenticity in tool use are examined, using activity theory concepts, in the context of seeding and nurturing learning community processes. The learner agency and the ability for learners to develop their identities as designers are of key interest.


<!--
REMOVE DUPLICATION
The first section examines the impact of a process drama with an aim to establish and nurture community practice. It highlighted the value of introducing almost-real processes, near authentic tools and the possibility of learners developing learning identities within a drama frame. This section looks in greater depth at the impact on learners of the tools and suggested design patterns of the learning design explored in the previous chapter. -->

<!-- For example, in the tension of restricting user choice in order to create more "visible anchor points" to increase potential for increasing the agency of learners. Like swimming in a protected pool rather than in the sea. -->

<!-- NOTE - DROPPING THE FOCUS ON INCLUSION HERE FOR A MORE FOCUSED APPROACH. -->

<!-- **Justifying selection of chapter contents**
The following elements have emerged from many in the learning design as of merit for sharing in this chapter based on the following criteria: key to the learning experience of participant; novel in terms of lack of existing research; supported by recorded data; and of potential wider interest outside this context.
IS THIS NEEDED OR IS THE CRITERIA ONLY THAT IT ADDRESSES RESEARCH QUESTIONS? -->



### Planned and emergent activity (in introduction to discussion)

The previous chapters have described interventions in design that can be characterised on a spectrum between those planned and introduced by myself as a facilitator and those which were emergent, i.e. invented or adopted by participants as a response to the contradictions covered in chapter four.  

In line with the concepts of formative interventsion and DBR elements of the introduced design changed responsive to learner need as the design evolved through iterations. Some introduced  processes outlined here were very minimal in embryonic form but extended significantly by participants.

Some sections here including discussion on element of the introduced drama processe explore how facilitators can encourage emergent processes as part of an introduced design.  This discussion chapter uses this conceptual spectrum as a way to explore an analyis of different aspects of agency aand inclusive pedagogies.

<!-- - tool support and design decisions allowing greater instrumental agency
- we can see emergent use of GDPs as both practice and knowledge in the previous chapter
- summary of cultural aspects -->






## Observations and Evidence on  emerging cultural practices (cultural dimension)

CHECK TO SEE IF ANY SHOULD BE IN CHAPTER 4 - THAT IT IS DISCUSSION-Y ENOUGH

NOTE THIS NEEDS A QUICK INTRODUCTION TO MAKE A TRANSITION - LINK THIS PART AND RECONNECT IT WITH CHAPTER 4.

### Introduction to this section  


AT theory emphasises that the process of activity does not start in a vacuum. This helps justify the formative intervention process which is active in intervention and in the initial shaping of activity. In an educational context, this can involve introduction of tasks as starting activities to shape. This is justified conceptually from a view of not restricting participant agency in that some form of activity should be suggested in order for them to make a rational choice as to weather to participate. It follows that this activity should encourage the communication that participant choice is significant in the design.

THIS IS ALSO INTRO - REMOVE? REDUCE?
Planned activities introduced by myself and those by participants. However the distinction is not so neat, as explored in the last chapter. In later stages, game design patterns were collated into an organised collection with accompanying resources and a navigational menu. However, many of these patterns however, we introduced  initially by participants who recognised them and wanted to add them to their own games.





### Emerging use of narratives and graphics which drawing on home funds of knowledge

**While the potential to add graphics was a core affordence of the starting processes of the templated game, the process of designing and sharing and the peer commentary on the process emergered as the sessions evolved.**

The literature review outlined the potential of home interests as funds of knowledge, especially informal learning. This learning design provided participants with different ways to input and explore their home interests in the narrative and graphical elements of their created games. For example the choice of game characters allowed the expression of identity. Other designed elements for example audio and graphical effects or written messages added to the overall aesthetic or polish of the game.

Video evidence indicated that conflicts involved between learner expectations and their technical abilities are helped by the use of the starting template. The
constraints of provided game elements and implied narrative structure of the template accelerated the initial creative process.

<!-- (like a  musical style from which to jam from, or provided constraints in a drama process which help guide improvisation.) -->

One pair Clive and Pearl, the grandparents of Toby, included a narrative message at the start of their game. This process surfaced the expertise of the family as beekeepers, sparking interesting conversations with other participants.

     var starttext = "This is a game which pits a honey bee against a swarm of Asian hornets,  which are alien invaders attacking bee  hives in the UK and which beekeepers are trying to stop spreading  here. Try to guide the bee to collect all the flowers without being caught by the hornets.
     Use the arrow keys to move the bee. Press return to START.";

<!-- In a noteworthy exchange a young participant Zi asks one of the grandparents of child if they had done any amazing things in their life. This exchange follows

   zi: Have you done amazing things?

The exchange seems to throw Pa but they draw Zi's attention back to the game. Showing that it demonstrates their interest in bees as they are beekeepers.

The source of Pa's hesitancy to share more is not clear. However her willingness to share that part of her personal story via the narrative of the game is shown here as is the willingness of the young participant to ask about the personal experiences of the older participant during the process of peer testing her game. -->

In another example, Mark and Ed designed a game around the character of a train driver that needed to collect coal. In subsequent post course interview Mark describes the impact of the child feeling like they could bring their own identity and interest into the project. "I know just your eyes lit up when you realised you could expand your interests into gaming." See Appendix 4.x (Mark and Ed working with home interests)

<!-- The process of creating assets builds in Molly the identity of a proficient maker. She wants to build on her achievement of being an "expert pixel".  -->



<!-- NOTE
NARRATIVE / drama IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER?
how do these two sections work together? remove this one?
 -->
<!-- The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;] BRING ON OTHER LITERATURE HERE ON PERSONAL EXPRESSION, FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA. Roque, Scratch, Kafai, Gee etc. -->

<!-- Ideally look for evidence of sharing in communities, especially developing processes, avoiding traps which sap momentum, -->

<!-- While these aspects are covered in other literature, and are therefore not covered in depth in this chapter, it is important to include their strong presense in the data of study. And to situate them in relation to other chapter contents. HOW EXACTLY. -->

Other participants expressed pride over their graphical creations. In this excerpt parent Molly has spent time creating a pixel art representation of an alien. The full exchange (see appendix 4.x) sees Molly cultivating a sense of ownership over the graphical element that she has created. There is also the development of a growing sense of competency in this area of asset design. She notes she is an "expert pixel".

    Molly: We’re finished.  Right what’s next? Now I’m an expert pixel? Now I have to figure out how to get it in there, don’t I? Without losing it. I’ll be very upset.
    Sonia: Have you saved it?
    Molly: No I’ve not saved it.
    Sonia: Save there. (points to relevant button on screen)

The growing mastery of this area also seems to help drive motivation to complete the next challenge. The sense of ownership spurs the technical process of saving projects. Her pride in her work and concern surrounding losing it provokes a fellow parent to show her how to save her work.

#### Summary: Home Funds and RQs

This research supports findings of other research which highlight value of incorporating home interests in  games, coding and media projects [@resnick_mothers_2012; @papert_mindstorms:_1980]. It also aligns with PBL literature which advocates the personalisation of projects and the value of exploring concepts using home funds of knowledge [@moje_maestro_2001]

This research indicates that in particular, allowing participants to incorporate home interests can be highly motivating in early stages of the design process. It can also sustain the coding activity later in the process encouraging participants to overcome problems in order to share the personalised object created.

In addition, the tacit knowledge of children as game players gives them access to varied affordances in the process of feeding back.

There is also evidence here that frictions involved in dealing with participant expectations of the genre and professionalism of the game they will create, are helped by the use of a templated game. Both in terms of the technical platform and the implied narrative and creative frame which scaffolds the initial creative process. This supports existing research on the value of constraints in facilitating rapid creative improvisation in the areas of music and drama. The domains of programming, game jams and hackathons also use constraints in a similar way [@gabler2005prototype].
HOW TO EXTEND?

<!-- NOTE - CHECK LITERATURE -->

<!-- This shifts the focus of activity away from emboddied STEM concepts, often maths or computing concepts, to provide a base for creative expression.

<!-- This shifts the focus of activity away from emboddied STEM concepts, often maths or computing concepts, to provide a base for creative expression. -->
<!-- While, the personal expression via narrative and asset design can be engage and sustain the motivation of participants, these processes brought tensions identified in the _design chapter_ namely: (edit down into list? ) -->

<!-- **Exploring Tension - time spent on task - ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**
Take the example above, through use of pixel art editor, and template with small, retro themed graphics, as a designer, reduce the propensity to spend along time on asset creation as retro pixel art is quicker to make. -->

<!-- **Expectations- ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**
- incorporating familiar or personally meaningful elements can involve challenges including that of unrealistic expectations based on previous game playing experiences -->


### Discussion on playtesting

 <!-- NOTE - Include examples here which do not talk of GDP explicitly - but other cultural aspects. -->

As explored in the literature review and previous chapter, playtesting is a rich and varied learning opportunities which encourages community-building behaviour.

<!-- NOTE - CAN SOME OF THIS BE MOVED TO CHAPTER FOUR? -->



#### Community concepts and norming behaviour emerging during playtesting

<!-- THERE IS DOUBLICATION WITH NEXT CHAPTER - REEVALUATE / REFACTOR - ESP CONCEPT OF SAFE ZONE -->


<!-- The elements of variables controlling player movement, the ability to place hazards in the layout of the platform game were initial changes that all participants made but the end results greatly varied in terms of the challenge of the games. Discussions on game challenge, specifically comments about how 'hard' participant games were the most common forms of interaction during playtesting.

Through this informal feedback participants sought to influence peers to modify the playability and challenge games to increase the enjoyment of peer players. For example, parent Molly had been focused mostly on completing asset design this had created a very frustrating game experience in terms of the player's movement. Just before this extract, as a facilitator, I shared feedback about using quite indirect technical language when giving feedback (See appendix 4.x). -->

<!-- PERHAPS TURN THIS INTO A TABLE WITH GESTURE?  -->

<!-- Bertie: That looks nice (referring to the graphical look of the game)

Molly invites Bertie: to play as she can't progress due to the difficult game controls.

Bertie: It jumps super high but so slow.  
Pause
Molly: He has to go slow because he's an astronaut, you see.    
Bertie: It's hard.
(Bertie leaves.)
Molly: (to peer parent with proud tone.) It's hard. Wow.

(Ed comes to play the game)
Ed: How much jump speed to you have?
Ed: Your jump speed is massive.

Molly initially misconstrues feedback from Bertie that her game is hard as a positive thing. A variety of comments nudge Molly to change her game to align with an emerging community norm of what a sensible jump behaviour should be. Feedback from Mick attempts to bridge a technical and conversational approach. Feedback from Bertie is direct about his player experience as a player.  -->

NOTE THERE IS SOMETHING HERE ABOUT ME STEPPING BACK AND LETTING THE COMMUNITY EVOLVE.

Ed gives a more technical explanation from  involving the naming of the variable _jump speed_.

Other children come and play the game but only for less than a minute before leaving. Towards the end of the playtesting process, as one child leaves, Molly comments "It's so frustrating." This suggests an evolving understanding that her game is frustrating to players rather than pleasantly challenging.

The indirect norming behaviours ... described in previous chapter ...  mirror observations seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues[@rogoff_cultural_2003] on learning in  community settings. There is an apparent tension in play here between encouraging individual agency of expression within the game and an evolving community tendency to norm peoples games to be more _playable_, specifically that player movement should conforming to wider expectations.

To better understand this process it is relevant to locate the source of these wider expectations and to evaluate their utility here. This is attempted in the discussion section of the chapter.

What we can draw from the data at this stage is that playtesing provides many leverage points to facilitating learner agency and discuss the limits of designs. IN addition, playtesting is a process that allows participants to demonstrate informed criticality as a player and guide the creations of peers via gameplay feedback.





<!-- NOTE - NOTES ON THE CULTURE OF HARDNESSS - FIT IN SOMEWHERE IF APPROPRIATE

When explored from game making perspective the hard is good lens, is limiting in terms of building the engagement of players. However, culturally the desire to make games hard for other participants is more understandable in the context of retro games. .

- arcade games were designed to be hard to extract money from players
- nes games reputation for being brutal as they often had no way to save states, and much of the games challenge, due to limitations of number of levels or modes of playing, depended on this 'hardness'
- this developed later for snes games , finding challenge and other forms of ways of maintaining interest for different genres of games_
- retro games are associated therefore with being brutal and frustrating.
- thus in some ways the process of making a hard game is a way of getting your own back at all the games that have frustrated
 -->
<!--
Other observations
- The process of teaching challenge via balance cards can happen early on
- some participants are resistange - see Molly's interactions - does this matter? -->

### Building Identities as Game Makers  - EXTENDED

PARK THIS FOR NOW IN DESIGN CHAPER

COULD RETURN TO THIS IN A DISCUSSION CHAPTER - AS HAS IMPACT ON GDP TOO.

My journal notes see an evolution of attempts to try to build into the program, activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers or more generally digital designers. In and early tentative attempt to define in broad strokes the types of game maker behaviour and underlying goals. In doing this I have taken inspiration from Bartle's game player types Hamari and Tuunanen, 2014). I translated player types to maker types based on notes in my observation journal and extracts from screen capture data. The following list of *Game Maker *types:

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users



For examples in the Vignette of S and T's interaction we can see attributes of the child as a Glitcher. In terms of understanding of the game as a dynamic system, this is seen clearly in the parent's alarm at the child's deletion of all elements of hazard. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. "It's no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid." The child seems determined to remove all hazards. My understanding is that she is also aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play. They seem to take pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context. The process mirrors play theory concept of playing against the game or dark play Sutton-smith, 2001).

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with the positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you. -->



<!-- NOTE - Preceeding To follow shifts in perspectives bound up in designing for others, and the shift in layers of abstraction,
This section explores what other shifts in design practices -->




<!-- #### Different styles of making
PERHAPS IN DESING SECTION - BUT TRY HERE FIRST -->
<!-- #### Circulation of peers and helpers
This often facilitates talk aloud of design decisions and justifications.
Cross reference playtesting -->
<!-- ### Accessing Help and Documentation

In the emerging community there was a variety of help available including;

- Written documentation from the learning design via step by step tutorials
- A series of code examples in working code playgrounds
- Facilitator help through asking for help
- Student Helper attention and help
- Peer support from parents and children -->

<!-- #### Tactical use of in-session support time

Parent Mark made a comment showing that he was aware of the particular value of the in-class sessions to overcome some kinds of blockages. -->

<!-- #### Tactics in accessing help from peers and facilitators

A common teacher tactic is ask three then me.

The family group of Mi, Zi and Ne showed a lot of flexibility and tactical choices when trying to overcome blocks.
Zi more directly and loudly asking for help for faciliator often followed by comment from his mother to leave him alone.

in 2019-03-18 - 18.20 Mi's meets many small blocks and asks for help from a variety of people.
- Student helper to get online,
- Peer parent about use of piskel, and then her son
- Ne daughter
- Mick overall facilitator -->

<!-- As we explored in the introduction and literature review, the ability to incorporate the graphical, audio and narrative assets into created games and playful digital designs allows for personal expression in a way that can be engaging and sustain motivation [papert, roque, kafai etc]; -->

<!-- Recap from Lit Review / Intro -->


<!-- - tension of a walled garden approach vs responding to freer design choices -->

<!-- As per work on Kafai and Roque who observe the following features of personal expression in a community game making setting.
- propagation of assets..
- pride sharing back?
- value of feedback, asset creation as a speciality -->


<!--
NOTE - When to put data about TOOLS in this chapter or that of the design chapter.
As interlinked.  Data in design chapter when it is based on journal notes and personal / literature based decisions. -->
<!-- NOTE - PULL FROM ALL SOURCES HERE - JOURNAL, VIDEO, INTERVIEWS -->

<!-- ### Tools
- Responses to choice of tools & Communities Choice of Coding Tools / Environment / Communities
  - Why not Scratch? Less of a community? So how to replace this? What of time considerations?

- Physical Elements as Tools
  - end boxes used as motivator / engagement
  - extract from interview?

### Creating Community Activity   

- Theortical context
  - Collaration from AT perspective - "collaborative activity" see [@eriksson_using_2019] for an overview

- Peer - side by side coding.
  - Parents coding too. See the comments by Molly:and her interactions / commentary. And the interaction of Ch-Pa and Te - the quiest support there.

- Game Playing and playtesting
   - Game playing at start of program - no observations but sets context
   - Play testing - and challenge - a culture of "hardness", curiosity about number of levels, as a vehicle for peer support,

### Discussion on Drama Process

#### Discussion on conflicts associated with authenticity of audience

**Learners may not find coding a project a motivating project if it is only a private activity with no authentic audience**

Making for peers has value but can be amplified and scoped using a fictional or controlled external audience often via scenarios.

<!--
MOVE To LATER DISCUSSION ON AUTHENTICITY IN LATER CHAPTERS?

In line existing PBL research [LIT NEEDED]  with previous iterations of this learning design the process of creating a game for a real audience of university students was motivating [DATA NEEDED].

While the use of a fictional audience in the drama is clearly inauthentic, authenticity is "on a scale" [find support].

In relation to existing literature this is well explored but the use of drama processes to add to this experience is potentially very fruitful to:  increase learner motivation; seed community practice; and  ADDITIONAL (something about learner identities)
-->

Play Testing - each lesson can help with short term motivation of having a game product ready  for others to play.  Showcase events help longer-term motivation towards and aid prioritisation as learners near the end of their project.

The process of starting with a broken but playable template game allowed learners to be able to share their game with others from the start of the coding process.

As a designer I identified this tactic as a way to address learner disengagement if game coding is taught from scratch via a step by step instructions from first principles, especially in younger ages.

Similarly, in my journal notes, I reflect on the difficulty of interrupting the flow of making activities once they are underway. I thus began avoiding stopping making to share points to the whole class and avoid demonstrating key concepts on the screen.



<!-- There are examples of the authenticity of the audience being used by participants
- Suzanna uses the imagined audience to norm behaviour.
- Olivia (Th) imagines the impact of her game on real students as a motivational factor and one which drives design decisions. -->


<!-- TENSION OF TIME ALLOCATION OF DRAMA PROCESS.
The tensions associated with the use of time and efforts spent by participants engaging with the drama processes.
The process of bringing people into the culture merit allocating time to address inequalities.

Here, in response to potential alienation from the culture of coding, I have prioritised the introduction of tools and processes which participants can draw on to build agency.  -->

<!--

<!-- NOTE - Find complexity here?  -->


#### Discussion on dimensions of authenticity and Process Drama

<!-- #### Authenticity of Problem / Project
Well established in PBL.
Here the challenge is make a game to share, thus well aligned. -->

Returning to the work of drama processes, Heathcote [@heathcote_drama_1994] warns against asking participants to genuinely make items in the processes explored. To do so, she argues, would expose their inexpertness in the cold light of day.

> "if they are makers of things (for example, shoes, ballgowns, or aircraft) they _must never_ (within the fiction, that is) _be asked to create the actual objects_. If they had to do this their _in_ expertness would become immediately apparent."[@heathcote_drama_1994, p. 18]

Authentic tools in settings where students may find their novice skills lacking can negatively impact on experiences of self-efficacy and thus agency. While this is clearly the case in factory-based drama process, the value of digital tools allows students to to work with more authentic practices.

CALL BACK TO AUTHENTICITY OF LAST CHAPTER - LINK TO AGENCY

In chapter four the use of coding tools and the impact on instrumental agency was explored.

<!-- In the learning environment of this study there are broad similarities and some key differences in terms of supporting tools and processes. -->

Authenticity in project approaches can profitably be applied to tools, processes and project goals  [@hung_engaged_2006]. Authenticity in goal here is clear. Participants make a real digital game. The authentic goal of making a game allowed participants to draw on tacit knowledge and navigate within implicit bounds reducing the need for intrusive instruction which might negatively effect feelings of agency.

As explored in this chapter and in chapter four, the authenticity of the tools and processes involved are more complex.

Playtesting processes are authentic and often informed by existing real experience as game players. These observations are in-line with existing research outlining the value of playtesting in game-making [FIND] and to address cultural barriers to coding cultures [@disalvo_glitch_2009].

There are examples of the authenticity of the audience being used by participants

  - Suzanna uses the imagined audience to norm behaviour.
  - Olivia (Th) imagines the impact of her game on real students as a motivational factor and one which drives design decisions.
The use of code playgrounds and js? structured along design principles which align with affordance theory.

THEREFORE - WHAT IS THE KEY POINT HERE?

While authenticity in coding context is potentially off-putting or prohibitive if too complex, it is motivating if linked with real life competencies and culturally relevant activities and outputs. In this context there is an explicit link between participant feelings of self-efficacy and their growing experiences of agency.

Educators should be aware of this tension and help resolve it by developing their competency and using simplified professional tools. The benefits to leaners are increased experience of agency, through x, y and z. And the development of an activity systems which has the following benefits / characteristics.

While this is broadly in line with PBL theories, and constructionism the use of CHAT perpective on agency brings some useful tools to the researcher and practitioner.
CROSSREFF -  list the benefits here.


#### Discussion on making  types and process drama / side missions

The process of exploring identity via side missions in this way surfaced the cheekiness of some young people and the pleasure they took in demonstrating their playful mischievousness. I began to make journal notes on this subject and talk to other games study practitioners. I began to ask the question can the surfacing maker types (as per player types) encourage awareness and celebrate the emerging practices that the community was producing.

As an example some players created impossible or overly easy game levels. They appeared aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play. They seem to take pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context. The process mirrors play theory concept of playing against the game or dark play [@sutton-smith_ambiguity_2001].



### Discussion on Drama Process and Agency

Aitken's and Heathcote's terms follow in italics. Within a _fictional context_ a _responsible team_ is contracted into a _commission_ by a _client_. The facilitator _frames curriculum elements_ as productive tasks and plans for _tensions_ to arise involving: _authentic contexts_, _messiness of learning_, maintaining learner interest and _resilience_ to overcome the _grappling and struggling_ involved. The following sections explore some of these key concepts via the example in vignette.

### Positive affective space within a drama process

The work in this research around designing and coding _in role_ and creating a playful context and language mirrors work done in learning languages to reduce learner anxiety by leveraging the potential for drama processes to create positive "affective spaces" [@piazzoli_process_2011; @stinson_dol_2006]. The drama process can be viewed as magic circle [@stenros_defence_2012; @whitton_playful_2018]. A magic circle is a concept which transmits the idea that game players enter a loosely bounded play space where they accept arbitrary play rules and enter a social contact to adopt a playful attitude.

<!-- EXPAND - Characteristics associated with the concept include: x; y; and z. -->



<!-- Other processes beyond the social and secret missions discussed were completed in role namely; the wider mission of making a game; the end reflection sessions; and guiding participants in the use of supporting documentation.   -->

<!-- This section aims to explore these observations paying particular attention to their value in the context of computer coding and using AT as a frame. -->

The experience of myself and participants being more comfortable performing some of the activities in role is facilitated by contracted together into a playful agreement where risk of perceived failure is reduced. In my journal notes, I observed, that when listing boundaries to activities within role, it felt similar to outlining the rules of a game rather that constricting their behaviour. Thus, I felt more relaxed restricting choice in role via the proxy of a playful encounter compared to my previously I  concerns surrounding participants feeling overly controlled.  
<!-- Thus less about  and more about contracting into a game-ful or playful experience.  -->


In addition, I believe part of my hesitancy in shifting activity from participant-led game making to reflection, or accessing documentation, stemmed from worrying that the learners would also find this shift in objective, from the organically developing design and play testing activity system to an externally imposed system of reflecting on progress, would be jarring, potentially disorientating and reduce learner engagement and positive affect towards the overall process. In other words, provoking a feeling that the fun's over, it's back to school. I propose that the drama fiction eases friction between competing activity system objectives.

<!--
PARK THE FOLLOWING FOR NOW - RETURN OR MOVE IF MORE COMPLEXITY IS NEEDED.

For example, Heathcote refers to curricula content as an example of object interests, e.g. exploring detail in history, geography and writing accurately or with expression.  -->

<!-- Heathcote posits that learners especially those resistant to authoritarian teaching techniques, appreciate the effort of the facilitator in aligning "needs interests" to "object interests" [-@heathcote_dorothy_1984, p. 185], arguing that it can create a generosity of spirit on the part of learners. -->

#### Reflection on reflecting in role



**It doesn't look like we've got anywhere but we have!**

<!-- **My reflections as a practorganiser itioner from my journal and those emerging from the process of transcribing and analysing the interactions.** -->

While drama scenarios can aid reflection both in or out of drama, O'Neill and Lambert outline the value of in-drama reflection, noting it is "likely to be more powerful than end-of-session discussion, since it allows individual and group insight to be articulated as part of the context" [-@oneill_drama_1982, p. 144]. In line with this intervention, they propose one way of achieving in-role reflection is to introduce an additional character that acts as an external audience. In this intervention however, main activities happen only weakly in role, whereas the end reflection highlights the fictional frame of the making more strongly.

<!-- MORE DETAILS ON DATA? A QUICK SUMMARY PERHAPS OF
NOTE ON CODING - LIMITED -->

Using the terms of student agency explored in the literature review, here we can see the use of the drama narrative used as a second stimulus both by facilitator to help convene learners and to help them participate in reflection, and project sharing [@sannino_principle_2015].

#### Discussion on mediated chat and potential for addressing contradictions in activity

Writing in role.

MOVED
The start of playful chat with aliens process began when Ed in a moment of free time expanded the use of space initially imagined to address technical needs by initiation a playful interaction which, while in the motivation to support different learner identities, was a novel, volitional action in this context. It is helpful to expore this interaction using AT and TADS terminology. Ed is in conflict, not able or wanting to engage in his existing creative activities while his father has a social break. Using the secondary stimulus of a text chat with fictional aliens, he writes a playful personal question to the aliens as an expression of volitional action to play, casts out an experimental kedging anchor. By co-incidence, I was on a different computer, saw this question, and was able to respond in real time. Thus, by getting a response, Ed's kedging anchor caught onto an anchor point and Ed was able to resolve this conflict of inactivity and in doing so both amuse himself and other other with humorous self-expression, and open-up a novel, child-centred activity for the whole group which could also address potential issues of alienation from the culture of _serious coding_ expressed by other participants.  



## Discussion on emergent elements of guided participation

This section describes and discusses some of the emergent, flexible and adaptive design practices that I observed in video data.

I also outline the rationale behind my responses to them.

### Encouraging peer learning and varied working practices

This section discusses some of the outcomes stemming from interventions and emergent participant responses in the area of peer and individual working practices.

In chapter four, one of area of contractions was the dysfunctional group work which was freed up by allowing greater atomisation and greater scaffolding of tool use.

<!-- Some barriers stemming from alienation from participant group working processes were resolved partly by freeing up some patterns of collaboration and interaction and removing others.

The process of parents getting in the way of children's not minding jumping in and invading social space struck me. Together with the frustrations of complexities of larger group work the restrictions created a tension between the suggested community norm of how division of labour was organised.

Thus in P2, rather than the larger groups of P1, smaller groups, allowing some children to work by themselves and others with parents. Avoiding large group fragmentation and encouraging freedom of participation vs benefiting from parental involvement.

There is a flexibility here which is encouraged by informal moments of  playtesting

These tensions are mirrored in similar research and were highlighted in the practitioner interviews that I conducted.
 -->

These tensions of allocated roles and dysfunctional group work are mirrored in similar research  - FIND THIS ON PAIR PROGRAMMING

These tensions were were highlighted in the end of P1 feedback and in some practitioner interviews that I conducted. FIND THIS IF SO

In contrast in P2 and P3 there is flexibility of interaction  which suits informal moments of playtesting.

Chapter five outlined examples of GDPS being used as a lingua franca in playtesting sessions for a variety of collaborative work from feedback to direct requests for help from peers.

ARE THERE ARE OTHER STUDIES WHICH ENCOURAGE THIS?

This informal, unguided approach is also present in some Game Jams.

In addition to ad-hoc partnership work and collaboration


### Beyond design cycle stages

As explored in the literature review design stages as a conceptual design tool is common in CS education, e.g. Resnick's creative learning spiral [@resnick_all_2007, p. 2]. While I did not ask learners to follow prescribed design stages, in data analysis I created a coding theme based on a design cycle framework: Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share. When coding I observed that naturalistic practice rarely matched the progression of the design cycle. The stages were instead fragmented and sometimes happened in parallel. In many interactions I observed improvisational approaches which incorporated ideation, planning, implementation and testing in space of a minute or so. If I had encouraged participants to follow prescribed design stages this may have restrict this flexibility in practice. This concern is echoed in research which critiques a similar, staged approach to creative writing in primary education using a writing cycle approach.  [@kuby_rhizomatic_2016]

In a closer review of key literature claims of of the value for participants of following design cycles are implied but not supported. Instead stages is are proposed as a tool to "discusses strategies for designing new technologies" [@resnick_all_2007, p. 2]. the following writing discusses the value of flexible approach to design processes observated in my research.


### Supporting Digital/Game Jamming

While the concept of Game Jams are established, the free form flexibility of the Jam process is often left to the skills and evolving practices of the participants.

This section explores the process of jamming in the context of game making. While the processes identified are often improvised, there is a group element of the process where makers pick up techniques from other makers in the group. I propose the value of facilitators noticing and nurturing potentially productive practices.

I propose that this process can have value in other areas of digital making.


Flexible design practices are often present in recorded data. Younger participants in particular developed impressively fluid practice demonstrating extremely rapids shifts between code editing, game testing, authoring assets in online tools and migrating files often while talking with peers. Older participants also showed rapid, responsive creativity. Clive quickly incorporated a boost to player health after a level after being given feedback during playtesting. In exploring sound making software Ed and Mark start a process of tinkering and messing about with the capability of the tools which spurs creativity. The joint jamming created two different soundtracks. This sparks a new proposal to incorporate different soundtracks for different levels. Pairs often adopted a similar spirit of improvisaion. For example parent Dan makes a suggestion - "Use paper to design?" - to which Toby replies "I'm just going with it."
###
These observations of the value of flexible design processes, invite discssion on how best to conceptualise and support these flexible approaches. Game Jams are accelerated events encouraging creative collaboration and innovation. While the event's premise is to promote collaboration, these events are inconsistent in their support and scaffolding of collaborative approaches [@goddard_playful_2014].

Other relevant perspectives include rhizomatic design approaches  [@de_freitas_classroom_2012]. Research exists on the promise of rhizomatic approaches design thinking in creative educational programmes [@biffi_chasing_2017-1]. However researcher identify significant competencies required including to "identify and synthesize the body of technical and even complex knowledge into a feasible structure" [@biffi_chasing_2017-1, p. 972], which are not well-aligned with the age group of this context.

Instead, I propose that the tools, process and the community in this study mutually encourage an improvisational approach often referred to as jamming.

There are disparate resources available for game jams but due to the adult centric audience and mix of abilities they are less guided in nature than many supported design processes aimed at school age audiences.

NOTE - Explore jamming in relation to lit review concepts and data of the chapter.

MOVE THIS CLAIM LATER.
**Claim:** The data in this chapter shows the value and further potential of mixing the more mature techniques of MoE and other process drama techniques with the ethos of game jams.

Recent research posits that Game Jams can be profitably used in formal education contexts [@aurava_game_2021], although there is scant guidance on how to address potentially problematic issues (list these). A complementary approach would be to significantly adapt the overall Game Jam format and to add greater scaffolding to the process as in the learning design of this research.


#### The potential of emergent "non-productive" activities

NOTE - Within the concept of jamming, activity which is casual seemingly non-productive can still transmit useful information to guide collaborative practices.

Much time in sessions was spent on activities that did not fit nearly into an accepted design stage, for example: opening software tools; navigating to correct locations; and finding past assets. These processes often  involved significant effort and collaboration between participants. For example the  migrating assets between authoring tools, converting to correct formats, evaluating new tools, and finding previously created assets. These are practices that I am personally familiar with. I call them digital laundry or digital housekeeping. Things that at times can be low attention span. Faff time is even less productive switching on the computer and waiting for the internet to connect, waiting for a family member to finish their rushed lunch or navigating to the right location in creative software.

 <!-- I have been pragmatic and map elements like this these loosely. Where appropriate I make notes on that activity in free form areas of other documents like spreadsheets. -->
 <!-- This limits claims I can make from the coded data. However it raises interesting points which merit discussion. -->


Skills to perform these activities were at often distributed between different family members. For some adult re-enforcing their identities as project managers, and for young participants forming identities as digital specialists. I noted in analysis of data that along with frustration there are also moments of creativity, and there are bonding moments which appear to be helped by this activity which is at times quite unfocused but also shared. In retrospect, many of the social missions explored above encouraged activity outside of established design stages. For example the lively discussion about game playing in response to the mission to _find out the favourite games of 3 other people_.

The process of swapping graphical assets used a shared Piskel gallery and games area which served to keep individuals informed in directly of progress being made, and to spark curiosity in the creations of others.

In addition, I observed that navigating these essential but non-creative tasks in a collaborative and playful way can reduce learner anxiety and help maintain a positive affect to the overall creative digital process. This observation is supported by an example in the next chapter available in appendix 5.x - an extract of which is included below.

| Participant Dialogue          | Participant Gestures & Activities              
|----------------|----------------|
|   |  Nadine has just rapidly demonstrated how to bring a created graphical element into the game |
|      **Molly:** How did you do that so quickly? I’ve got to like, carefully...  |  Molly makes hand gestures to show a sense of hesitant keyboard use)  |
|  | A parent peer next to Molly laughs.      <br/>    Nadine, the child of Molly bounces up in place and smiles broadly.    |

In summary, it is of value to create spaces to leverage the potential of these in-between moments for participants. This a concept is developed later in this discussion.




### The interaction of emergent / flexible deign practices and the collection of Game Design Patterns

THIS SECTION SHOULD BE DEVELOPED.

BRING IN A SUMMARY OF LEARNING FROM THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER ON GDPS.

In the previous chapter we explored the use of GDPs as a possible response to the challenges to project work and the lack of domain specific frameworks.

The nature of the framework provided by game play design patterns can be explored through the lens of agency and authenticity.  

They are authentic  -
There is choice  - and interaction - contribution to the overall object.





<!-- The use of double stimuli by larger groups of participants to break out of contradictions in activity and thus further their agency is conceptualised by Sannino in TADS [@sannino_principle_2015] -->

<!-- ##### Relevant terms and concepts in their relevant scope  / focus

 -->

<!--
MOVE THIS SOMEHOW INTO A DISCUSSION AREA
#### Helpers supporting supportive community behaviours

While not a key part of this study, it is of value to briefly examine the role of student helpers in this phase.
One of their remits was to support the work of participants and to guide reflection by asking simple questions like "What have you been working on?", What are you working on now. What do you want to add to your game. Beyond this, students also gave feedback between playtestings sessions, connected different participants, supported parental behaviours,   into the design process via debriefing sessions. In journal notes I made observations and gathered feedback, while not fo extensively studied there is potential here.
Especialy in the potential to replicate family supportive behaviours with non-expert facilitators in a volunteering settings, specifically with bespoke guidance to support game making.

#### Code roles  and experimentation

- perhaps recognising limits - or fearing the process of breaking her game - and returns to more familiar territory of changing game assets and level design.

- Glitch - 2019-05-08 - Te and Da  - create moving enemy but it totally leaves the screen. This caused amusement and participants knew how they thought they would follow that up.

 The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful. -->

The following observations have been made by comparing the codes on stages of design and types of participant interaction. This data was then triangulated participant feedback and my own journal notes. The observations are presented themed by the design stages used in the coding process with some general observations listed at the end of this section. -->

 <!-- NOTE PERHAPS MOVE THE GENERAL OBSERVATIONS TO THE END OF THIS SECTION AS DISCUSSION OR SOME WHERE EVEN LATER. OR ANOTHER Chapter
 REWRITE TO KEEP FOCUSED ON DESIGN PATTERNS.
   -->


<!-- #### Discussion on design stages and GDP for this pair - DROP THIS?

 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.
 This parent was much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents. The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker/player type (concepts explored in previous chapter). This interpretation seems confirmed by less social interactions compared to may parents. The pair engaged far less in play testing of other games and peer support to overcome barriers. They also followed the stages of design more closely than may other groupings, an observation which is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

 This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." This alternation is driven or facilitated by the different stages of implementing GDPs. The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

 Using the coded data from nvivo to compare design cycle stages with pair collaboration, it can be observed that the most likely stages for pair collaboration were during the Ask/Imagine stage, Testing and Planning.

 The vignette shows evidence of that the actions of the parent to re-engage the child at different stages of the design cycle helped sustain the child's engagement in the more focused design process happening on the screen. However, an opposing pattern of behaviour may also be valid. When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups. Within Rogoff's model of community of learners [-@rogoff_developing_1994], this observation is viewed as valid form of participation. The child's ability to legitimately disengage from pair coding to observe the work and interactions of others in this emerging community of learners may also be sustaining.

 It is of note that when describing the design cycle for this family that this family along with others are working with decomposed smaller design challenges in the form of implementing GDPs. Thus the cycle is repeated for each new pattern that the pair take on. These smaller design iterations can be expressed within the framework of AT as an activity system. -->

 <!-- #### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

 NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION?
  NOTE - This more general observation may be part of the previous chapter

 We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

 - The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
 - This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

 Discussion

 - The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

 The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity. -->

## Discussion on authenticity and agency in relation to (personal appropriation?) of tool use

### Discussion on authenticity and agency concerning tools and resources  
<!-- NOTE- This chapter's coverage of tool use is incomplete and the use of physical arcade consoles is explored in chapter six.  -->

This chapter has exposed the tensions that developed in the activity systems and subsequent evolution the tools used include code authoring environment, supporting resources of printed and digital format. This section begins to analyse these tensions in more depth, in particular the intersection of authenticity in tool use and participant agency.


<!-- While the affordances built into the code playground are valid secondary stimuli in initial in helping to seed initial activity, supporting documentation can be seen as a form of secondary stimulation more aligned to the process of building agency. -->

<!-- _lifting the hood_ (see LR) -->
<!-- The distributed nature of the toolset used helped build authentic digital literacy skills. Analysis of the video data of participants using the more fragmented tool set used, which involve one online tool for coding and others for asset authoring, reveals a large number of broader digital literacy skills. For example, the processes of replacing a block image with a bespoke pixel sprite which comprised: file downloading; file migration using the browser and file manager; browser tab navigation; graphics tool use in Piskel; copying and paste text code; and selecting more than one lines of text code with mouse or keyboard shortcuts. Undertaking the full process involved learning a complex chain of these individual actions.  -->



#### Increased scaffolding of tools can increase instrumental agency but at what cost?

Increased scaffolding of learner resources and tools can increase instrumental agency for novice coders but at the potential cost of reducing access to the tools and processes of authentic creative communities. Many of the design adaptations described in this chapter align with motivations of constructionist design principles explored in the Literature review [@resnick_design_2005]. Techniques or concepts which are embodied in both the Scratch software and the adaptations to the tool set of this intervention include:

- reducing barriers to entry through techniques to avoid code syntax errors
- increasing engagement with a code authoring environment that provides live feedback of the results of code output
-  supporting immediacy of creative process by providing a library of assets.
- The use of black boxes?

While these elements of ethos are aligned, the process of supporting novices to use an authentic, text-based language and authoring tools used by professional community required more specific adaptations (o) : creating simplified but extendable starting template; highlighting code variables as key design affordances; using a grid structure to visually facilitate level design; and simplifying the syntax and the structure of the game code.

Of particular relevant to the process of this design is the  constructionist design principles, choose black boxes carefully.  Resnick [@resnick_reflections_2005] explains the designing of black boxes as the process of as abstracting away areas potentially problematic areas of the production process. Black boxes allow the learning design to steer participants towards the exploration of certain concepts and away from those that have been hidden.

The _black box_ design decisions of use of tools and documentation create a kind of border between the participants experience with the protective environment of the scaffolded learning experience and a more open ecology of learning from code in the wild; specifically via the use of authentic developer focused tools, processes and documentation. A significant drawback of using a bespoke tool for novices is that attempts to progress by stepping outside of that protective area risk culture shock and alienation from the newly unfamiliar environment.


<!-- This is a long-running theme of constructionist research, with roots in Papert concept of Microworlds, typically embodied by the Mathland environment, where participants control a robotic turtle with lines of simplified LOGO code language.  Because the turtle speaks only LOGO, children are drawn to speak LOGO to progress. Thus, Scratch and Mircoworlds can be seen as digital playgrounds with affordances that encourage certain types of play. -->



#### Different black boxes for different goals


My design decision to build the toolset as structure on top of authentic tools and languages can be likened to creating a protective harbour to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency.

Participants are able to leave the protective harbour by accessing more authentic documentation and moving beyond existing templates. The experience may be involve choppier waters but the tools and processes remain familiar.


#### The potentially awesome impact of lifting the lid on authentic technologies   


Lifting the lid on hidden technologies and concepts in hands-on, exploratory processes can be empowering for participants. Ratto explores this via critical making [@ratto_critical_2011], a process which playfully surfaces Latour's [@weibel_making_2005; @latour_cautious_2008] concepts of shifting matters of fact to matters of concern by exposing taken for granted artefacts as objects that have been designed (for better or worse). Conversations between participants showing an inspirational or engaging impact on previously unknown technology. For examples, exchanges among participants that communicated a sense of awe of how much effort and coding must be involved in a professional game based on the relative complexity of the code of their simple game.    

    Pearl: It just shows you what goes into these games.
    Student Helper 3: Think about how much effort goes into.
    Pearl: You just take things for granted don’t you?



#### Exploring different dimentions of agency  in tool use  (using the concept fo dual stimuation)

The distinction between instrumental forms of agency and more authorial/ transformative variants were explored from the perspective of AT in the methodology chapter.  

Design decisions of tool use can to increase agency in practical terms by providing affordances or by removing barriers to use. Conceptually these practical dimension can be framed as instrumental agency or removing aspects of negative liberty caused by technical barriers [@matusov_mapping_2016, p. 433].

I now turn to explore tool use to engendering authorial and transformative agency [@engestrom2006development; @haapasaari_emergence_2016; @sannino_formative_2016].

An illustrative design tension emerged surrounding which kind of documentation to prioritise. After initially steering participants directly to code snippets, I subsequently directed them instead to step by step tutorials which also included a link to the code snippets. I shifted between prioritising instruction-based practices and more piecemeal, bricolage inspired (see LR) developer practices. Whilst the process of instruction is problematic in terms of learner agency this vies with the practicality to establish a common understanding and shared framework for production.

The motivations for creating starter templates are similar for both educators and professional template creators. The goal being to want to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency.  This strong alignment with authentic, professional practice may help learners transition to other forms of web coding projects, due to the similarity of as this element of practice.

<!-- PIVOT -->

The concept of dual stimulation can help illuminate the design and pedagogical tensions related to authenticity of tool use to shed light on dimensions of participant agency.


In research on the use of wiki technology by students Lund and Ramussen [-@lund_right_2008-1] caution against mismatches between the first and second stimulus; interpreting project tasks or objectives as the first stimuli, and the tools used to the as secondary stimuli.

WHERE BEST TO ADD THE SERIES PART - THE MANY - AND LINKING TO MAKING TYPES TOO
They also outline the importance of awareness of the likelihood of multiple stimuli in modern technical working environments. While Sannino's [@sannino_principle_2015] work on the volitional aspect of the process of double stimulation cautions 'double stimulation cannot be subsumed to the general idea of mediation by symbolic tools' [-@sannino_principle_2015, p.2], it shares the a perspective that there is value in exploring the process to explore participants development of agency in professional and educational settings [@sannino_formative_2016].

Introducing additional tools in the form of documentation to the initial coding environment and template provided in early stages introduced tensions between the opportunities for independent development and the additional complexity of the process.

Traditional, printed, instruction-based software manuals are in decline partly due online documentation but also due to the increased intuitive nature of their design [@pogue_user_2017].

This decreased need for secondary documentation minimises the possibility for task / tool mismatch.  As outlined above, to avoid the barriers experienced when searching authentic, developer-focused documentation and the support forums, I created  bespoke code examples in an online collection. This curated replication of authentic process of finding and incorporating code snippets into the starting template was supported the development of skills used in professional coding communities. The careful alignment between navigational documentation and the participants driving objectives of the mid-level activity system of implementing a game element, also helped avoid mismatch between task and tools described above, a theme explored in more detail in chapter five.

THIS SHOULD SHIFT TO A CULTURAL SECTION?


### Agency in response to a series of second stimuli

Learner agency in the form of choice over the the chosen activity is present not only in the dimensions of the difficulty and theme of the game features they wished to add, but also in their approach to undertaking it.
KEEP THE FOCUS ON TOOLS HERE - SIGNPOST TO OTHER SECTIONS IF NEEDED.

Some approached objectives in a methodical manner, others socially and others embracing a playfully disruptive stance. Some decided to focus extensively on the creation and implementation of graphical assets and level design. While the distributed nature of the toolset, hindered peer learning in P1 as too many tools were introduced, in P2 it helped build authentic digital literacy skills. Some young participants became remarkably swift and adapt at thus transforming chains of actions into a fluid operation. Learners who had mastered the skills were asked by others for help, becoming domain experts, and thus providing additional affordances in the learning community and building an identify as specialist within its. It is of value to examine specialisation can be seen through the lens of double stimulation. The choice to specialise, marks a form of transformative agency. Participants craft for themselves a specialist status which becomes shared and celebrated by the group. Further examples are explored in chapter five.


### Asking questions about the challenge of applying this model to classroom environments.

This chapter has narrowed down form cultural observations to guided particpation and then personal appropriation of of tools and practices.

Is this a good section to begin to ask how appropriate is the 3M approach (summarise in the next chapter), to a classroom setting?

In a classroom setting the personal appropriation would have different expectations. The recreation of concepts and knowledge for testing purposes or even more formative assessment is quite different from the more naturalistic approaches outlined here.

### Conclusion to this section

There is alignment with other research in terms of how

- authenticity of tools can be problematic and needs design adaptation, often black boxing
- this process merits attention and alignment with overall project aims of the designer
- Challenges encoutered by students in tool use can result in productive and creative responses in development of productin cultu4res (explored later)
- ideally emergent and producing a culture series of


## Discussion on designing for learner agency

I propose that learner agency entails the practice of designing and facilitating effective and engaging creative and technical learning environments.

<!-- This chapter has explored the affordances and potential of selected tools and processes in the context of in-person, family-based, game coding. As explored previously the literature on design for face-to-face communities which encourages community members to develop their own practices is sparse. -->

<!-- This section begins to explore observations in line with conceptions of authenticity and agency and other studies, identify processes to to aid researchers / practitioners replicate practice and understandings of the process. -->


<!-- I will extract observations from this research that extend beyond the process of coding into other domains.   -->

<!-- In this section analysis uses the language and concepts introduces in literature on affordances and transformational agency which in turn draws on concepts of conflicts in activity in activity theory. To help this process a quick recap of relevant concepts in relation to the contents of this chapter follows. -->

<!-- This study follows socio-cultural take that while objects have a forma of agency, affordances are not magic and become interesting to educators as part of activity stemming from human-initiated activity. -->

### Nurturing agency by creating space for emergent practices

<!--
NEEDED: MORE SYNTHESIS / DISCUSSION ON Instrumental agency, TRANFORMATIONAL AGENCY AND AUTHORIAL AGENCY IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS WORK ON METHODOLOGY. -->




THIS SECTION IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This section continues to explore tensions surrounding support learner agency, useful conceptions of agency, and starts to explore recommendations for researchers and educators working in this area. As previously explored, varied conceptions of agency exist including: instrumental, authorial and transformative agency [@matusov_mapping_2016]. (See methodology chapter). As a learning designer, design decisions to create a sheltered harbour, increase the instrumental agency of learners allowing them to experience a feeling of control over their creative process.

Adopting analysis which aligns authorial agency and transformative agency, there is a potential tension between instrumental agency and transformative agency. A design which minimises possible conflicts also reduces the potential for participants to solve them both individually and collective responses.

Thus, I propose that key areas of the learning design should be more open in structure to encourage the emergence of participant responses and novel practices. The concepts of affective space and magic circle  previously explored in the context of drama process as a way to encourage participants to improvise from a starting structure are of value to provide guidance to practitioners in the domain of informal digital design.




### The freedoms and restrictions of playgrounds

In this research, similar metaphors have emerged in the pedagogical and technical process surrounding the concept of playgrounds and gardens. In the previous section the use of a curated set of design patterns can be referred to as a walled garden or sandbox. The process of checking the performance of games is called playtesing. The web-based environment which reduce the complexity of web development and provide community and immediate feedback are named code playgrounds. While some of this language is specific to the creation of games, other terms are also prevalent in non-game coding.

These metaphors invite a connection to play theories concept of as the magic circle. Play theorist outline the value of stepping into a more controlled area of voluntary experimentation where the fear of failure is reduced. Game rules are norms which seed participation in community processes. The playful context of the game's magic circle can facilitate participants to adapt norms and rules to their own playing styles. Through this lens, the interaction of playtesting, code playgrounds and a sandbox of game patterns emerge as a key practices to facilitate and maintain learner agency. The discussion of the next chapter explores the intersection of these elements in more detail.


### Extending the metaphor - anchoring in sheltered harbours

My design decision to build the toolset as structure on top of authentic tools and languages can be likened to creating a protective harbour to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency.

Participants are able to leave the protective harbour by accessing more authentic documentation and moving beyond existing templates. The experience may be involve choppier waters but the tools and processes remain familiar.

This chapter has discussed affordences of a bespoke and mutually designed learning exeriences and their impact on learner agency. At times, Sannino's metaphor of a kedging anchor thrown by participants to pull themselves out of a conflict or blockage in their process has been used. The metaphor is useful to explain the active process of participants seekig to resolve conflicts and problems in their creative processes. However, much research employing this metaphor is often used in less-structured workplace settings. As such, the designed nature of the environment is less relevant. This section proposes an expansion of the metaphor to encompass concerns of a more structured learning design.



-----

NOTE - THIS SECTION MOVED FROM METHODOLOGY

Sannino augments the concept of transformative agency by double stimulation (TADS) with a metaphor of a sea vessel warping using kedging anchors.

    We may think of the second stimulus as an anchor. Anchors are commonly understood as stabilising devices to prevent a vessel from moving. However, not all anchors have this function. Beside the heavy-weight anchors, there are also kedge anchors serving the purpose of ‘warping,’ that is, pulling the anchor once it has settled on the ground, for moving the vessel away from a problem area. [@sannino_transformative_2022, p. 4]

In this metaphor emphasises the active volition of participants to overcome tensions and blockages in learning. In our context learners would throw an anchor of intention out into the learning environment to then pull on to
Not all throws will be successful. The anchor may slip or it may catch on something in the learning environment that allows the leaner to pull  

Affordances in the learning design can be viewed in this frame as a catching point for these anchors [@hopwood_agency_2022]. An effective learning environment provides a sea bed with many rocks (affordances) for warping anchors (volitional acts of participant agency to transform learning) [@aagaard_teacher_2022].


-----

In the original metaphor the casting of the anchor is random, experimental. It is unsure if the anchor will catch on anything under the surface. However, in this design, participants aim for affordances as visible anchor points. In the design above such anchor points include: regular play-testing; the use of documentation; and highlighed variables and level structure in the quick start stage.

To aid learners agency, designers notice existing paths of participants and add explicit anchor points and make them visible to learners. The process is on-going and mutual. Additionally, this work happens in an facilitated environment. Design decisions server to clarify common problems areas, thus making the water clearer to better see anchor points. The job of the designer is in part to identify the causes of turbulence and thus create support in a sheltered space of a harbour.

<!-- Similarly, as the process unfold the faciliator may see learners repeatedly run into the same obstacle and not be able to see the anchor points available to them. Perhaps even catching onto snags or other debris, false anchor points. -->



<!-- This my be done by
- defining or reducing the use use of specialised terminology  or
- hiding away un-needed complexity.
- signposting issues like a lighthouse or similar big thing on a rock - don't go there  
- imagining the lines of sight of the learner. try to remove large obstacles to potential anchour points. -->
Many design decisions were made to create a supported, simplified coding environment. Relevant examples from the previous chapter include: using an online code playground; skirting use of specialist terminology; hiding away un-needed complexity in the code template.

While it is important to acknowledge the danger that such support may make learners run into trouble if coding other projects outside of this supported space, the use of authentic code language makes this less of an issues than with specialised coding environments aimed at novices [@hagge_coding_2018]. Thus to make one addition to the metaphor this design is like a sea-harbour, tools like Scratch are like a swimming pool.


#### Summary on metaphors around creating space

KEEP METAPHORS TO THIS CHAPTER - BUT EXPLORATION OF THE IDEAS AS A SUMMARY FOR PRACTITIONERS IN NEXT CHAPTER?

The title to this chapter was  _Seeding Game Making Communities to Facilitate Learner Agency_. This evolved to _Seeding and Nurturing Game Making Communities to Facilitate Learner Agency_. It could be extended to _Rewilding_ metaphor to reflect the importance of leaving learners to evolve their own processes as a form of authorial and transformational agency, albeit within the forms of pedagogical walled gardens explored in this chapter.

The growing /agricultural metaphor can be compared with the metaphor for agency used in the discussion which is more nautical in flavour, led by Sannino's work on TADS and kedging anchor metaphor which is extended to incorporate a protected habour for novices in a creative environment. Similarly in the literature there is a thread around play-spaces and playgrounds. One common thread here is the importance of a sheltered learning environment and somewhat curated set of affordances.

The process of Playtesting and working towards an external audience.

Some of the processes for building community were more mutual - collecting requirements

Creating documentation
Other processess

Of course this may make learners run into trouble if engaging outside of the harbour or in real situtations.

### Synthesis on implications for project based practice to encourage agency

Previous chapters explored varied understandings of agency.


#### Divining authentic frameworks

The process of discovering the framework of GDPs explored in chapter five merits exploration from the perspective of replicability.

Is there is something particular about the format of the game product to be designed that particularly suits this process. What other products does it suit?

What are the broad implication for the use of this frameworks in other domains.

PERHAPS ONE FOR FINAL CHAPTER


#### Keeping hard fun hard

Hard fun is a well used concept in creative computing education.

A relevant challenge is the difficulty of structuring resources in a way which can support the diversity of the directions in which participant want to progress their design. My results Drawing from authentic resources can be chaotic and create problematic errors.

Where participants lacked the concepts and technical  language needed to find external support materials, the combination of the starting code template and a selection of curated code and documentation examples helped address this.

However, in designing out conflicts the facilitator may reduce the capacity for participants to profitably address them, both as individuals pair or collectively as a group. There is a balance here for the facilitator to take an appropriate position on.

Some parents were aware of this tension as outlined in appendix.

There is a potential tension between instrumental agency and transformative agency.

## Implications in conceptualisations of forms of agency

This thesis has explored agency through the following concepts: instrumental agency, authorial agency, and transformative agency through double stimulation.

This section contributes observations from this research process with the following aims.
 - to serve other researchers undertaking similar work using activity theory and design based approach
 - to help practitioners be research informed



<!-- Transistion - When designing with learner agency in mind. Some of the following may help -->

## Conclusion


<!-- These include; authenticity of programming environment and language, use of the existing structure of the phaser library, the learning process of participants getting stuck and having to resolve tensions, my time limits providing individual support as a facilitator of a group, and the patience of participants when they encounter incomplete documentation. -->

<!-- While some areas of the design emerged in phase one, became a stable part of the design, (for example template and supporting documentation) other processes remained more flexible to interpretation and direction by participants; , playtesting, division of labour and use of home interests.   -->



<!-- #### Seeding community practices vs allowing open experimentation

While this has tricky implications for practitioners in more formal settings, there are tactics and tools which can help.  

DEVELOP THE ABOVE AS A SUMMARY OF THE PREVIOUS STAGES -->
<!-- The drama process aligns with particularly the use of a playful, fictional absent character called the Golem or Wizard that both young people and adults collude to keep real.  some of the aspects of the 5th Dimension project [@blunden2014seeking] [@blanton_effects_1997]   -->

<!-- The  marshalling towards certain goals to maintain a shared script / experience. -->

<!-- In Papert's [-@papert_gears_1980] study of his childhood play with gears he celebrated the joy of understanding processes hidden from others by taking apart and playing with technology.  -->




<!-- Because of the common use of design stages as a conceptual design tool.
And a prevalence of research linking design thinking  stages  and coding. I coded data to that. When coding data a design cycle framework was one of the code structures. Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share. However, when coding I quick became aware that naturalistic practice rarely matched the progression of the design cycle. The stages were instead fragmented and sometimes happened in parallel. -->


<!-- When designing program to prioritise learner engagement on to respond to their interests I found over structuring activity via design stages may be not be productive. The emerging process in this design related more closely to tinkering methodologies (previous explored). -->

<!-- However, while tinkering and improvisational approaches have been advocated in the domains of hands-on STEM exhibits in museums as part of the Maker movement, they have been less adopted in the domain of learning computer coding. -->

<!-- One side effect of coding by design cycle stage was to expose the limits of even an iterative cycle interpretation of the design process of these participants. -->
<!-- There is little data on the effectiveness of value even of explicitly teaching design thinking / engineering stages. -->
<!-- I did not give explicit facilitator input or guidance on the stages which may also have avoided norming participants towards such patterns. -->

<!-- Another cause for a less stuctured was the use of a templated game which contained andauthenticity which invited testing and sharing with after only quick changes. -->

<!-- I propose designing for more chaotic practices can increase agency as it reduces a feeling of prescription that may reduce a feeling of agency. -->

<!-- FIND MORE EVIDENCE FOR THIS. THIS IS LEARNER CHOICE OVER ACTIVITY / AND IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THINGS HAPPEN -->


<!-- While there is limited data as this was not a subject for participant interviews, and there is no comparative data here, this is an area that merits further investigation. There are parallels in existing research.
MOVE TO CONCLUSION THEN -->

<!-- While computer design stages taught using perspective stages approaches [Waterfall etc], there has been a more recent move towards agile, iterative approaches which allow for more flexible and responsive working processes. -->


<!-- In other areas of creative processes the concept of jamming is potentially useful as a grounding. -->



<!-- While design cycles was not an explicitly part of the game making instruction, certain interventions supported this approach. In particular the use of maps as a planning and reflection tool and the use of playtesting as a social and personal form of evaluation of emerging designs. -->

<!-- Implication one - When mapping the activity to a design cycle. There may not be neat matches and at some stage if the process is very fragmented the researcher or teacher can legitimately ask how valuable the design cycle is as a planning or analytical tool. Other less formulaic theoretical perspectives on creative processes exist including rhizomatic approaches [@de_freitas_classroom_2012]. A**Observations on design stages**nd some attempts have been made to incorporate design thinking with a rhizomatic approach [@biffi_chasing_2017-1]. -->

<!-- #### Designing to incorporate learner identity

NOTE - INCLUDE HOME ED CONTEXT TO AN EXTENT TO PRECEED LATER CAVEATS IN CONCLUSION

Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].

This chapter supports this research and also finds game making as  a suitable medium to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

Conceptually, within AT, these interventions and design choices which yield possibilities for self-exploration can be see as potential anchor points to increase learner agency.

In summary:

Family game making, of completing projects together with your parents or siblings has potential to remove the **I'm not that sort of person** barrier of cultural identity as participants are surrounded by their people.

  - the choice of retro games as a medium provokes sharing for older participants while their enduring popularity maintains common ground with younger participants;
- encouraing game playing and discuauthenticityssion of games helps surface positive affect and

<!-- **Discussion on reducing learner anxiety surrounding text coding**

Elements of the learning design that aimed to create an welcoming learning environment included:

- adapted my sessions to ensure a consistency of non-digital and playful activities.
- reflection in role
- encouraging flexible making patte
- flexible pathways to making resources and navigating their learning.

This chimes with existing research:

- the importance of managing learner anxiety in second kubyacquisition [@krashen_principles_1982; @young_language_1992]
- deeper into Heathcote
- something about authenticity of audience, and resulting time constriction creating the right Onekind of pressure / motivation. Game Jams/ Hackathons

These can be synthesised using TADS metaphor and enriching it with a greater focus on the specificity of what makes the anchor points catchy. Thus developing the metaphor in include the importance of affordences which can be responsively designed into the learning environment. -->

<!-- Some of these observations and starting points were the continuation of my own work as a facilitator of open making focused training sessions.

<!-- This chapter was organised in part around starting processes and practices and tool use which  emerged from this starting point. This distinction is fluid as some tools and processes which emerged in community practice, prove to be successful and which are then adopted as a suggested process for the next iteration of the design.

We can note tension of restricting user choice in order to create more "visible anchor points" to increase potential for increasing the agency of learners. Like swimming in a protected pool rather than in the sea. This tension is explored more in following chapter.
