<!-- IMPLICIT ## Justification of choice of methodology -->

### The primacy of context and utility

    A central assumption underlying
    this essay is that any abstraction of ‘content’ from its ecological functioning   (e.g., use within a particular situation) is likely to undermine its perceived value for any situation (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2000; Nathan, 2012) or
    the learners’ belief that they are likely to do something meaningful with that which they are learning. @barnett_ecosystem_2019

This primacy of context described above underlies much of the social turn of educational and psychological research.

**Context and Generalisation of results:** Barab and Squire [-@barab_design-based_2004] describe the messiness of design-based research and that this creates a challenge to the researcher of how to present results in a coherent way which is of use to other practitioners. There is a tension between sticking closely to the context of the research and the concrete specifics or stepping back to generalise and being lost in abstraction.

This context of this research, which is x,  

**Utility of research:** While the concept of utility is slippery their is an increasing stream of research work which places the researcher as an agent of change in a complex world where the need for systemic change is apparent and urgent.


### Justification of choice (esp compared to contructionism)

Much of the foundational literature on game making focuses on personal dimensions of learning (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996). They draw on Papert's constructionist approach which extends a piagetian take to propose that construction of personal knowledge happens best where learners can experiment and manipulate objects [@ackermannPiagetConstructivismPapert2001]. Such a focus on individual learning is problematic from perspective of sociocultural approaches due to a tendency to ignore both contextual factors influencing the learning setting and the evolving use of resources, processes and shared understandings by emergent communities of learners [@oloughlinRethinkingScienceEducation1992] .

While noting the focus "individualist" approach of many studies from constructionist researchers, [@barab_practice_2000].

The alignments noted by Barab between constructionist approach and apprenticeship also apply to DBR namely "learning occurs within a context of use, learning is frequently collaborative, learning as authentic, learning as inquiry-based not transmission-based" [@hay_constructivism_2001, p. 3]. Thus the broad claims are in alignment with wider socio cultural approaches.

Constructionism as a movement has done important work in creating design guidelines but much weaker as either an underlying theoretical or analytical framework.


NOTE - THERE IS IMPORTANT WORK HERE ON AUTENTICITY- and the potential tensions with agency - ie if authenticity is working a the elbows of professionals, students have less ownership over the process.  [@hay_constructivism_2001, p. 34]

WHAT DOES BROADER FRAMEWORK OFFER?


<!-- Notably, later work from Kafai incorporates broader social approaches and attempts to bring them into the constructionist fold @kafaiConstructionistGamingUnderstanding2015. Kafai and Burke draw on the conceptions of Rogoff [-@rogoffObservingSocioculturalActivity1993] of personal, social and community learning planes to advocate the wide-ranging benefits of 'constructionist gaming'. -->


Cobb [-@cobb_where_1994] identifies two broad schools of constructivism, one focusing more on individual cognitive processes which follows the work of Piaget and the other drawing on the academic lineage of Vygotsky which locates knowledge formation as a cultural activity.




 <!-- Some of the specifics of these processes have already been named in the section above looking at collaboration.  -->

<!-- Other concepts of value include Vygotsky's concept of mediated action Wertsch, 1994); Rogoff's [-@rogoffObservingSocioculturalActivity1993] take on guided participation within a community of learners; and more detailed analysis of roles community-based transfer of knowledge in practice Lave and Wenger [-@laveSituatedLearningLegitimate1991]. -->


As my study seeks to address cultural factors which act as barriers to participation in digital making, it requires a method of research which allows the detailed description and evaluation of complex, emergent learning environments.

There are a range of valid methodological approaches suited to this study. These include participatory design Muller, 2007), ethnography and guided participation,  communities of practice [@laveSituatedLearningLegitimate1991] , Activity Theory .  

I have chosen to use activity theory as a base for the the theoretical framework of this study and to supplement it with the technique of design-based research. I also  draw on the work of Rogoff [@rogoffObservingSocioculturalActivity1993; -@rogoffGuidedParticipationCultural1993] and the use of three planes of activity to analyse complex community actions.


### Socio cultural research methods

<!-- There are particular limitations in the kind of empirical research that characterises many studies involving. -->

<!-- Many of these limitations involve research in to background cultures of participants and how they can be involved into making activities and a focus on creating and sustaining an authentic learning environment. -->
In the literature review we explored sociocultural views on learning and development on learning in created cultures.

The focus of this study is on the construction of shared meaning and practices as part of an emerging community of game makers.

To do this I adopt a sociocultural approach and specifically design-based research. This section explores complementary methodologies of value before outlining key characteristics of design-based research which make it an attractive candidate for this study.

This focus on the environment and context is in line with social and cultural lines of research. Socio-cultural research and perspectives can be broadly described as...

Barab and Squire [@barab_design-based_2004]

For the focus of this study on developing game coding abilities particular aspects of importance are of understanding of the importance of context, and the ongoing development of cultural artefacts.
NOTE - Thus in the next chapter particular attention is paid to the development of the artefacts and processes developed as part of the learning design.

As we have seen in the literature review on game making, context is explored in the three main streams of research into tools and processes to support game coding namely: schools environments, professional contexts; and informal spaces.


## AT - Conceptualising activity in this learning design

This section examines the use of activity theory to examine the data and help conceptualise the learning environment and processes.

NOTE - for similar work see [@barab_using_2002]


#### Levels of Abstraction in Activity Theory

The educational activity can be seen as different scopes of activity.

- wider education
- guided activity
- specific actions and operations.

While game making can be seen superficially as the primary activity,

OTHER RESEARCHERS ARGUE??
I argue that a narrower objectives  most vital unit of activity for participants.

#### Choosing smaller units of analysis

This may be a smaller unit than common in sociological studies.

Barab and colleagues justify smaller units in their study observing emerging practices in a technology rich learning environment [@barab_using_2002].


**Activity, Actions and Operations**

MOVE TO ANALYSIS DISCUSSION SECTION OF THIS CHAPTER?
Move summary of Activity, actions, operation (as per Barab here), link to GDP as a project / unity of activity.
In the methodology chapter the concept of activity as a primary unit for analysis to research community activity was outlined.



<!-- DROP THIS - NOT NEEDED
While Blunden makes a pragmatic proposal to use the project as they key unit of activity [-@blunden_interdisciplinary_2010; -@blunden_collaborative_2014], there is a strong case to make for the sub-project of implementing GDP as a key unit of analysis .

REWRITE THE ABOVE - TALK OF EVOLUTION OF RESOURCES AROUND GAME FEATURES VIA REQUESTS -->

<!-- DUPLICATION IN GDP CHAPTER CURRENTLY.
From the perspective of participants, the goal of implementing individual game patterns rather than the overall goal of making of a game, took up the majority of their focus. This can be evidenced in the following observations;

- the frequency of GDP language referring to patterns used by pairs in particular in the process of collaborating on their games
- the utility of the smaller unit of analysis in aiding resource creation
- the value of completing something concrete a sense of sustaining achievement.
- the ability to reflect after implementing each sub project,
- any other value for practitioners, parents and young participants - i.e. in navigation and goal setting. -->

<!-- Thus while GDP emerged as a main unit rather than the whole game, in play testing with others the wider focus of making an engaging game came into focus. Particularly the shift to wider sense of game as an enjoyable experience for others AND??? -->



<!-- (see blunden for more on project as unit of Activity
https://www.activityanalysis.net/andy-blundens-vision-of-activity-theory/ )  -->

<!-- NOTE - Thus GDP can be seen as a sub-activities of the wider overall goal of making a game. Which invites discussion on why GDP were chosen as the primary unit of analysis. -->

<!-- NOTE - DISCUSS THE THEORETICAL INPUT IN RELATION TO THE ABOVE POINTS.
NOTE MORE THEORETICAL INPUT - DRAW ON TERMINOLOGY - WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO IDENTITY KEY UNITS OF ACTIVITY / ANALYSIS (AND WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UNIT OF ACTIVITY AND ANALYSIS) -->

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMi56ZBSows -->

<!-- We have also looked at the other studies which look at game design patterns as a useful tool for advanced and less frequently for notice coders.  -->

<!-- In the following sections, I draw on observations of participants in practice to outline how game design patterns are used in the making of games.  -->
<!-- #### LOA in Computing pedagogy
Call back to PRIMM and Waite Sentence's work here -->

### DBR and formative interventions.

My own research in game making is an experimental approach to create a new learning design. I have worked with young learners, local families and undergraduate student helpers to evolve a game making design. A key driver of my research was to explore the potential to draw on family experience in learning activities by working with families to make games together.

I propose that this environment is a fertile research base to jointly create learning activities with a wider potential application. To facilitate this goal I have taken a design-based approach which acknowledges the importance of context in educational research [@brown_design_1992].


### Design-based research and formative intervention studies within educational field

Design based research is a varied discipline which can take a multitude of forms [@mckenney_educational_2021]. The core elements include: research as an intervention, iteration, involvement of participants in the evolution of designs, and a flexibility of research outcome based on how events unfold [@easterday_design-based_2014].

One of the key motivations of this approach is to produce educational research that has a high utility for practitioners through developing theory that is rooted in contextual practice and which can produce new pedagogies and resources [@cobb_design_2003-2].  

**Early limits of DBR**



Critique of DBR often stems from limits in application. For example, the context of experiments, particularly viewing the classroom as a controlled environment [@cole_design-based_2016]. In addition, lack of adaptability and mutuality in terms of taking on board the suggested adaptations of learners.


Another poported principle of  design-based research -  is that research participants also influence the ongoing design of the research [@barab_critical_2004; @cobb_design_2003; @downing-wilson_design_2011].

However in application this varies not a key part of all definitions [@easterday_design-based_2014].

<!-- which is present in the techniques of design experiments, mutual appropriation and participatory action research - -->

Adatations including mutual appropriation from Cole's work and formative interventions from Engeström's work


Later work on DBR applied from a CHAT perspective has addressed limitations in this methodology [@oneill_understanding_2016].

While, this study does not take a strong position on formative intervention / DBR, it is broadly aligned with the need to take into account learner-initiated innovation and the importance of broader contexts.



Designed systems: Learning environments are designed systems; be they existing systems like that of the classroom, or newly designed systems [@barnett_ecosystem_2019; @cole_design-based_2016].


<!-- Here, I try to strike a balance which stays concrete but which also pulls from my observations a framework which may translate in to other game-making and creative project based approaches. -->


## Conceptualising agency



DOES THIS NEED MOVING?. PERHAPS TO METHODOLOGY
THIS WOULD THEN MAKE SENSE WHEN LOOKING AT TENSIONS / BLOCKAGES IN THE DESIGN CHAPTER.

Cultural mediation via artefacts [cole], as a base.

Look for tensions in ATs - and how learners overcome barriers or blockages.


### On agency, activity theory and formative interventions

Agency and autonomy have disputed, often inter-related definitions or are often ill defined in studies [@huang_autonomy_2013; @matusov_mapping_2016].

Stetsenko places agency in a socio-cultural theory between conceptions of humans as chiefly individualistic or   helpless bodies in wider cultural phenomenon   
[@stetsenko_critical_2020; @matusov_mapping_2016]. See also feminist reconceptualisations of autonomy as agency[@abrams_autonomy_1998].

Hopwood outlines three major grounded conceptions [@hopwood_agency_2022], TAS, TADS and relational agency.

Matusov and colleagues outline many forms of agency to educational concepts.  [@matusov_mapping_2016]

The concept of instrumental agency to aid learner control is also useful as a way to reduce friction in learning designs. This mreo limited conception of agency as a way of getting things done is an attractive concept in designing for learners by designing out obstacles.

Matusov and colleagues also propose authorial agency [@matusov_mapping_2016] as a useful concept - DEFINE - brining transformational agency within that perspective.

The authors also note the nature of agency as situated in context. Thus we do not say learners have or lack agency, as it is not a learner property independent of context[@nieminen_what_2022].

### On double stimulation and agency

Conflicts and tensions between participant motives and different parts of activity system are sometimes revolved quickly through change, or remain more persistent and can be referred to as blockages.

Double stimulation refers to the use of tools and processes to overcome such conflicts awareness of these tools and active use of them engenders agency [@sannino_principle_2015]. While many studies have examined the process in professional settings there is a paucity of study in the area of "student-centered contexts of learning" [@isaac_cultural_2021, p. 93].

Blockages caused by contradictions are also analysed the fields of design and HCI with an aim of revising designs to remove them [@karanasios_moving_2021].

#### On affordances and anchors
<!-- NOTE
AT's relationship with affordances more here [@ba_erentsen_activity_2002; @] -->

Other researchers have found the the scope and focus of affordances important to clarify [@wolff-piggott_activity_2016-1].  Focus particularly in terms of who the affordance is for.

Affordances have been misused, assigned magical properties, including agency of themselves [SUPPORT].

This study follows socio-cultural take that while objects have a forma of agency, affordances are not magic and become interesting to educators as part of activity stemming from human-initiated activity.

Nardi and colleagues give an overview regrounding Gibson's concept of affordances as action possibilities in line with activity theory concepts of mediated action [@kaptelinin_affordances_2012]. Their focus is primarily on individual action.

While there is a The wealth of HCI literature in line with activity which discusses and applies concetps of affordances, the focus is often on the individual rather than on collective action [@kaptelinin_affordances_2012].


However, affordances are originally conceived of as part of activity, not separated from it [@ba_erentsen_activity_2002].

NOTE - more on affordances here from Nardi

Sannino augments the concept of transformative agency by double stimulation (TADS) with a metaphor of a sea vessel warping using kedging anchors.

    We may think of the second stimulus as an anchor. Anchors are commonly understood as stabilising devices to prevent a vessel from moving. However, not all anchors have this function. Beside the heavy-weight anchors, there are also kedge anchors serving the purpose of ‘warping,’ that is, pulling the anchor once it has settled on the ground, for moving the vessel away from a problem area. [@sannino_transformative_2022, p. 4]

In this metaphor emphasises the active volition of participants to overcome tensions and blockages in learning. In our context learners would throw an anchor of intention out into the learning environment to then pull on to
Not all throws will be successful. The anchor may slip or it may catch on something in the learning environment that allows the leaner to pull  

Affordances in the learning design can be viewed in this frame as a catching point for these anchors [@hopwood_agency_2022]. An effective learning environment provides a sea bed with many rocks (affordances) for warping anchors (volitional acts of participant agency to transform learning) [@aagaard_teacher_2022].

TADS and the associated metaphor of warping anchors is normally applied in settings of group action.


### Formative Interventions Case Studies

#### Agreeing terminology

Returning to the varied form of DBR / CHAT / Formative , I need to pick a terminology name.

Penuel [-@penuel_emerging_2014] chooses formative interventions as a suitable term, which is valid within CHAT circles.



**More On Formative Interventions**


One of the most striking set of practical techniques are those used in Engeström's take on Expansive Learning, specifically set of processes applied in a workplace setting called Change Laboratory (CL) [@engestrom_putting_2007]. The CL processes suits a formal workplace where there are existing concepts of Community and Division of Labour and Norms that have resulted in contradictions to be explored and resolved. My project is differs in that beyond general participant conceptions of what game making involves, there are few if any established community or working processes. Thus while interested in the CL process, the kind of reflective, and time intensive codesign of the core resources and primary goals of the programme seemed beyond the commitment level and interest of the participants.

A complementary take on formative interventions also from a socio-cultural perspective is exemplified by the 5^th^ Dimension project led by Michael Cole [@cole_design-based_2016]. This educational intervention used University support of volunteers, equipment and technical support in after-school settings in the San Diego area. The intervention introduced a fictional narrative to create a shared 'project' for the different participants involved to promote a shared understanding of the work via intentional goal setting Brown and Cole, 2008). The concept of the importance of project is used to encompass and engender a sense of commitment from participants Blunden, 2009), (explored in earlier sections). In the 5^th^ Dimension intervention, a narrative fiction of a 'wizard' to rapidly construct a shared sense of project. In similar approach to Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert, roles are created and breathed into life by the facilitator and affordances of the learning design to accelerate an adoption of principles of practice. (explored previously).

I am guided by the concepts behind the use of the models rather than drawn to an off the shelf application of CL processes or similar interventions. While some of the material used in CL and the fictional device of the 5th Dimension supports their primary tasks, others could be said to be support secondary considerations of navigating learning, establishing shared concepts and communities and reflecting on transformations in practices or understandings. These dimensions are sometimes explored in CHAT using the term of secondary stimuli used to facilitate and complement the primary task as part of the concept double stimulation.




## Data Gathering and Preparation

### Aligning data gathering and analysis with socio cultural approach

My process is informed by the work previously explored, specifically Rogoff,

The process is a suitable approach for informal education.

The research questions invite a broad spectrum of analysis - cultural and social factors.

The depth justifies smaller data size and depth of analysis.

One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour. Large amounts of video data are being gathered, up to 20 hours of footage for each 2 hour session.

Turning attention to the gathering and analysis of other data, such a rich set of data, will allow the cross referencing of the many sources.




Again while diversity of data invites drawing on diverse methods of analysis, AT will provide a foundation for the analysis of these diverse data.

<!-- WHAT IS THE FOUNDATION FOR ANALYSIS ?
CERTAINLY FINDING AND RESOLVING TENSIONS.

There is a framework for looking at tensions here.
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sce.21254?casa_token=cBrHq4V42XUAAAAA:qLvlA17sLIGDHnxN_XqTgZpBDP39phmbLXVzu6QFn89LzBtXshp-y4hFVmi2CvmWTYdj50XNe2qSqg -->




### Data Processing

While the rich set of data invites the cross referencing of the many sources, it also presents challenge on how to deal effectively with the large amounts of data being gathered. The use of a 360 camera reduces the amount of live video footage of interactions needed. Instead of multiple cameras pointed in different directions to capture participant interaction, participants are arranged in a square pointing inwards towards a central 360 degree camera.

<!-- I use a software sustainability approach also influenced by a personal modification of permaculture computing ideas and ideas of free software and open document approaches. The very nature of working with video is time consuming. -->
<!-- There is sometimes a danger of imagining how a new data gathering tool could be useful but then not being aware of all of the potential pitfalls which can make processing the data time consuming. Also  -->
<!-- On a personal note, I sometimes like the challenges involved and sometimes find them infuriating. It can be like a specialist knowledge which you can use as a currency, or as a hidden knowledge that you take pride in sharing. -->

<!-- I use a software sustainability approach also influenced by a personal modification of permaculture computing ideas and ideas of free software and open document approaches.

- Data portability and interoperability
- Software sustainability, in particular longevity
- Licencing - FLOSS licence ?
- If proprietary - then what is the business model?
- Is batch processing of files possible?
- It it a cross platform approach - in particular can I use it on debian based linux systems?

I also take a more practical approach which takes into account working with peers and that such advocacy is not a core part of my job or this research.

Such an attitude may involve compromises or hacking systems, software or processes -->

#### 360 Video Processing

The processing of video and audio data of both captured screens and 360 video data and high quality audio data involved several stages yielding advantages in capturing the gestures and facial expressions of potentially all participants in one recording. It does however present challenges. While this merits further exploration a brief summary of challenges is presented here.

The process involves large video files that are easily corrupted in transfer. While the files are split into 8 minute segments  but also can be confusing
- time navigation - also confusing - sometimes put up on the screen - but inconsistently
- moving and keeping a track of data from week to week and over years is complex.
- processing data requires special software - from samsung
- viewing data on a normal vlc player - needs extra processing using spatial media

I chose the software flashback pro primarily as it was intalled on and availble at low cost on home computers. Flashback saves data in a format. This include audio, video screen capture, learner keystrokes, mouse movements and optionally one or more webcams. I decided not to record on webcams for the following reasons:

- intrusive feel - having the webcam on and the resulting red light on the screen, I felt was less conducive to feeling comfortable than one 360 camera in the middle of the room.
- less resources - recording webcam on the laptop
- reduced video file size of final data file
- less complexity when processing data -

It not possible to code the natively created files directly. Thus need to be converted to mp4 to import into coding software like Nvivo. In this process the keyboard and mouse data is lost.

<!-- Thus original files have been retained in order to cross reference that data if it is useful. It also presents other options for analysis which are similar to much more in depth analysis of HCI research of professional set ups. While this is beyond the remit of this study, certain uses do present themselves strongly for future investigation. Particularly the study of such data to identify common mistakes or frustrations when interacting with the user interface. Such misconceptions could be addressed in direct teaching at the start of the next session. -->



#### Learnings and recommendations

The following learning and recommendations emerged from this process.

Prioritise displaying time - have an old school clock under the 360 camera. For example.

Check viability of data at each stage of processing and movement.

## Data analysis methods and justification

My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer, participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. I also record the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants.

One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour.



#### Interview data


#### Practitioner  interviews

These were limited in number but were a rich source of thinking to help develop and deepen my reflection in journal form and to inform lines of thinking. The chosen interviewees represented a diversity in audience.

Saskia Leggett - researcher in Family Learning program under direction of Roque. She took a leading role in creating the recourses coming out of the program.

Matt - academic at. Also active in a non-profit learning coding

Dave  - Parent and volunteer at Coder Dojo and participant in

James Clegg - PGCE student and volunteer student helper for a summer program of game making.


### Participant interviews

These were limited in number but allowed triangulation and confirmation of data observered in video recordings.



### Other data


My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music.

<!-- To be able to effectively analyse these diverse sources, I will need to prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes. I explore some of the emerging themes and criteria for selection which incidents to explore in depth in the results section below. -->

The process of analysis of journal notes and resulting resources required a different approach from that of video data.

The following resources were examined

- Book Journal pages
- Digital journal entries directly in response to teaching sessions
- Additional teaching resources
-
<!-- - Linear support book and print outs to support participants in sessions
- Additional 3M model resources to help navigation and reflection and gameful approaches -->

Journal Notes were used in the following ways: (perhaps code this)

- as a reflective tool after sessions
- as a note pad to plan resource creation
- as a sketch pad to explore the relationship between Concepts being explored and existing game making frameworks
- as a

The quantity of data prevented extensive and detailed coding using thematic analysis.

Instead, observations are triangulated with data from lit review to expose key themes and tensions.

My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use and other relevant interests. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music.

<!-- AT allows an exploration these diverse sources of information as mediating artefacts which are the enabler and product of the shifting goals and outcomes of the programmes participants. -->

<!-- A key strategy of AT used to locate learning happening in an environment, is via the identification of contradictions between different elements of the activity systems and subsequent study of how these contradictions are resolved (Engeström and Sannino, 2010). I plan to use my journal and participant interviews to identify key moments of contradictions and resolution to study in greater detail using the range of data available. I am also inspired by the work of Oliver and Pelletier (2006)who employed contradictions between systemic elements to create a coding scheme used to interpret video data in a study on game based learning. -->



## Analysis of Video overview

#### Rational and approach of video data analysis


- thematic analysis
- other analysis

Initial thematic analysis was informed by literature review, early analysis of journal entries.

Some elements were refined based on emerging data.

<!-- The gathering of data and revision of teaching materials took place over several years. As such, there was time for extensive reflection and reconsideration of factors involved in the learning design in dialogue with existing literature on game making and game making communities. -->

How much emphasis to place on the Thematic Analysis is questionable. It served to answer the research questions in the following ways.

- as a process to get closer to the data
- to contrast thematic analysis of the stages of design with other learning models like PBL
- to identify roles through repeated patterns of interactions
- to reflect on the thesis questions

LATER - Following the approach of Morcom [@morcom_scaffolding_2014 I drew on Rogoff's  [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of sociocultural activity used to help understand activity in a Community of Learners.

.
## Coding Video Data

NOTE COMPRESS THIS SECTION


<!-- I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies [@derry_conducting_2010]. I use a variant of discourse analysis to explore interactions of participants captured on video recordings. Mercer and colleagues identify discourse analysis as a loose associations of methods to support linguistic analysis of interactions to identify emergent patterns [@mercer_methods_2004]. While a common pattern in classroom interactions is that of IRF, initiation (teacher), response (student) and follow up (teacher) [@sinclair_towards_1975] , the inherent assumption that a teacher will be leading an activity will not consistently be appropriate for my study; although at times a parent may take this role. Other discourse analysis frameworks that take a sociocultural approach [@lyle_investigation_1993; @phillips_beyond_1985], and specifically those from project focused studies [@hmelo-silver_facilitating_2008; @moje_maestro_2001] allow more detailed treatment of the incorporation of tools and cultural artefacts into a collective discourse. -->

<!-- To avoid distraction from AT as my principle analytical framework I am in agreement with Wells (1999, p. 172) who proposes the use of AT's concepts to situate 'spoken discourse \... as one, but only one, of the semiotic tools that participants use to achieve the goals of action'. Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals. -->


### Notes on Underpinning of Thematic Analysis of Video Data

Summary of thematic analysis - https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/uploads/production/document/path/18/18247/Kiger_and_Varpio__2020__Thematic_analysis_of_qualitative_data_AMEE_Guide_No_131.pdf



#### What was Excluded and Rationale

The following themes were excluded but did emerge as potential learning outcomes in the final model;

- Elements of Computational Thinking
- Systems Thinking Concepts

They have been excluded as there is other extensive or focused work in these fields (previously explored in the literature review) on CT which this study which this study does not need to replicate.

#### Coding Participant Roles and Interactions.

Evolving notes on coding of roles and interactions are in an online document here. https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit

Roles are different from interactions existing on a higher order of anaysis. Repeated patterns of interactions can be seen to develop into roles. Thus a more grounded approach may concentrate initially on interactions and develop this to become roles through analysis. However, many roles exist in other similar domains.

For example, the work of my own staring point when coding was guided by Barron and colleagues work on the roles of parents as learning partners [-@barron_parents_2009]. The roles are as follows: Teacher, Collaborator, Learning Broker, Resource Provider, Nontechnical Consultant, Employer, and Learner.

when coding I started with some preset codes from the literature for examples Barron's codes on parent roles when helping digital projects. However, as coding progressed, I modified and extended these codes to better match the data I was working with

Specifically, the following were removed from Barron's typology, parent as employer, non-technical consultant. Learning broker and resource provider were merged as some of the detail of those roles involve take place outside of the learning environment being analysed in coded video.

 I judged it appropriate to and less complex to analyse and code the interaction between participants rather than code the behaviours by participant type.

#### Coding Design Cycle Stages

There are similar stage based approaches to creating a digital project. Firstly project based learning (PBL), then Inquiry based learning, finally design thinking. This design could adopt any one of these, however the creation of a digital product more closely resembles a design approach with testing stages of the created product.

The design process characteristics are broadly as follows; the process is often iterative, involves evaluation and separates planning from implementation.

Resnick in this area has written of a creative design spiral.

The model is similar to the ADDIE model from instructional system design: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. The discipline of teaching engineering also has a similar design stage cycle with many contesting variations [@winarno_steps_2020]. Engineering is Elementary project adapted from the ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) guidelines [@syukri_impact_2018] involves the following steps; Ask, Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share @hester_engineering_2007.

It has been adopted by the area of computing is one used in a recent book on coding by Bers @bers_coding_2021.

It is possible to be more specific when coding and include a wider terminology of technology and domain specific language. For example, debugging in the area of computer programming and playtesting in the domain of game making. I have had to weigh up the value of including these more specific terms and deciding to keep a more generic approach primarily to reduce complexity while undertaking video coding. Sub-categories add complexity and time to the process without necessarity adding a great deal.  
ADD IN A JUSTIFICATION BASED ON HOW RESULTS PAN OUT.

#### Coding Game Design Themes

NOTE THIS IS NOT REALLY USED IN DATA - thus make minimal  

The process of learning game making through deepening your knowledge of game elements is explored  by Jesse Schnell -@schellArtGameDesign2008.

Coding based on the game elements that are being added to the game serves to xxx ?

As way of coding initially I considered the MDA framework for the simplicity and the focus on the user experience being taken into account.

- mechanics
- aesthetics
- dynamics

Later, I note the following limitations.
- The language is not accessible to teachers and learners.
- The definition of aesthetics is very wide incorporating user experience in a way that was not suitable to learners.

Later consider...
MOVE TO DESIGN CHAPTER?

In early stages I was influenced by the categorisation of game elements used by GSM team which also was implemented in the Game Jam Guide [@cornish_game_2018; @institute_of_play_gamestar_nodate].
The key elements are:

- SPACE: Where the game takes place.
- GOAL: What is the objective of the game? What are you trying to do?
- COMPONENTS: What are all the objects or actors in the game?
- MECHANICS: What actions take place in the game. What are the verbs involved?
- RULES: What can or can’t you do in the game? What defines boundaries? Does play happen in real time or do you take turns?

A blend of the two gave the following staring coding scheme in terms of activities related directly to adding features or altering the game.

## Non-code - detailed transcription of video sources

NOTE  - highlight this process much more

#### Grades of analysis

- quick Analysis
- sections coded and described in 5 minute chunks
- themes of interest identified - in relation to evolving RQs as per DBR
- some sections transcribed in more details based in themes, more detail on gesture analysis also added

A page of quick analysis of the files online here helped to shape that decision on what sections
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpAIqHPg_Z0S5MWeS0rBTvxCL1N9NQButam4Ozq39Ek/edit#

#### Justification of selecting sessions and sections for more detailed analysis

The process of transcribing into 5 minutes sections involved
 - description
 - identification of 3 planes, different use of AT scopes (next chapter)
 - level of response to key characteristics interventions

Criteria  for inclusion included both practical and theoretical considerations.

- Good quality recording
- Diversity of kinds of participants, ages especially
- Diversity of participant actions in terms of tasks being worked on
- Diversity of kinds of pair and peer interactions


#### Using a 3 Planes Approach

WHY NOT GROUNDED? OR TO WHAT EXTENT WAS IT GROUNDED? IN THE AREA OF INTERPERSONAL ACTIVITY.

Rather than taking a grounded approach this data was analysed using 3 planes of sociocultural activity. The existing relevant framework saves time, especially as a more emergent approach was  (in part ) in coding video data.

The process aligns with AT analysis in the scope of the activity - and in the separation out of the community level of the triangle added by Engestrom .



RQx addresses the formation of a game-making community. This process is co-constituted by planners, facilitators, parents and children. This dynamism and dialogue can be captured in this framwork using the concept of guided participation.

 - The advantages of drawing on funds of knowledge, and the activities that I used to do this, as well as connecting to wider communities are address well with the plane of culture, in the concept of Apprenticeship.


While more complex, the plane of more individual participatory appropriation, allows for alignment and then transfer to more formal learning environments. This then makes this research more relevant to class room and guided sessions.


 - While the three planes provided a higher level framework, the specifics of the data gave greater granularity and formed sub categories of coding - thus avoiding the problem of analytic preconceptions




 <!-- The analysis of these resources using the three planes involved a choice of some of the following

- using a spread sheet and putting categories and notes in to columns
- using a table in word to record notes on data in-situ -->

<!-- The video data explored in nvivo is very time consuming, and given this and the factor that the transforming reflections into  learning resources, already involves a process of filtering, a much courser level of data analysis. -->

<!-- However, using a static text only approach such as describing data in prose or using a table in a word document does not allow for filtering based on themes which is potentially useful as an analytical too.   -->

<!-- Thus using MS Excel as a simple way to collate data without translation seems appropriate. -->





### Transcrition of data

separeate out from coding_


### Starting analysis in 5 minute sections

### Selecting sections analysis

### Incorporating gesture



### PROPOSAL Coding impact on design/ processes on learner agency - boiled down -

<!-- NOTE  I would say no - too complex for coding  -->

INSTEAD HOW TO ADDRESS THIS?

Answering RQ - on pedagogical resources / agency / use of GDPs

THIS IMAGINED FOR CONCLUSION BUT ALSO CODE TO IT? OR ABOVE?

- learners developing agency through personal expression of home and other Identities
- agency through choice over pathway via GDPS
- agency through flexible design cycle pathways, especially via community playtesting
- developing agency through celebration of different game maker styles
- authenticity of tool use, especially docs and access to Community
- authenticity of audience - and role of drama to facilitate reflection

### Grades of video data analysis

Describing different grades and pass overs of the video data.

Initial notes on contents of video recordings: notes on kinds of activities happening and quality of Data

Then deciding on 8-10 video sessions warranting full coding of activity.
This was based on the following factors, quality of recording, how much activity, richness of interactions, a range of diffent kinds of participant interactions.

Notes on goals, activities, interactions, fragments of dialogue and brief observations. Video coded in segments in Nivivo
In this level, the rough coding involved by breaking up video timescales into 5 minute sections lessens the ability to make exact claims however for this study it opens up lines of initial questioning which can be explored in future studies or triangulated with other data in this study.

Another level went over the 5 min sections looking for data relevant to 3 planes analysis - how was activity able to be interpreted culurally, socially personally.
This generated points for results chapters.

- Full transcription of key moments: and description of participant activity, activity on screen including simple gesture analysis


### Limits of / problems with video data analysis

The choice of the videos to code more fully is rather skewed towards finding interesting data. Thus it may not be fully representative of the experience of all participants.

Choosing in a different way - around less interaction - would expose more barriers to participation to game making using the 3M model.


### Analysis of activities based on Cultural, Interpersonal and Personal focusing

As per Rogoff.

Not coded in nvivo. However this was a useful phase.

Note on the spreadsheet used to transfer from coded document.
A summary of the activity and then what implications did it have under each.

This ended up being the most useful - allowing different uses of GDPs to emerge from the process.

### Discussion on evolving coding process - PERHAPS SHIFT TO LAST CHAPTER finally

The process of trying to decide a main focus was often tricky.

Take for example the process of Da in 2019-05-08 - where he was leading some fairly advanced work on researching and reading developer documentation and the constructing a new design pattern.

There are competing and overlapping intention and foci here for the participants.
 - Solve immediate problem - add new pattern
 - communicate cultural practice of finding, reading and adapting developer level documentation and help from forums.
 - give hands on experience to the notice coder

Most clearly there is an overlap here between the interpersonal working on a code problem collaboratively for educational purposes and the interactions with the wider cultural artefacts and practices from a professional environment.

Thus the process of writing this up was not neat.
To overcome this issue...

In addition the personal plane was perhaps the most problematic to address given the data gathered.
Even when participants were demonstrating their personal knowledge by sharing back or directly altering game code, this was as part of a social and cultural practice.
Thus my interpretation involved ....


### Data Validity - Triangulation of Data

Draw on other chapters to represent overcoming of weaknesses of design-based approach.

<!-- For example in

Imagining a constructionist game-based pedagogical model: Using tabletop role-playing game creation to enhance literature education in high school English classes -->

### Generalisation of Results

Generalisation is one of the guiding principles of DBR. While results are intertwined with context, designs should be assessed for generalisation to other settings.

Explore this in more detail - draw out a debate on how situated learning in this context - and wider debate is.

- More than one iteration.
- In different settings
- Using different with different software

This is potentially complex to describe but worth it if wanting to talk about generalisation.

NOTE - This could be dropped or picked up again in the limitations section

The process of exploring this guided the development of the research questions.



<!--
Generalisation is covered in this thesis.

<!-- In early stages of delivery I adopted an open project based approach. I will later describe how this evolved in to a template game using a javascript game making library and an online tool used for phases 1-4 which participants were invited to add to and alter.

The last iterations of the learning design adopted the MakeCode Arcade tool as a new game authoring tool. This block based programming environment reduced participant coding errors allowing a greater focus on game making concepts. -->

## Research Questions

<!-- - What  game making pedagogies exist?
- DROP? What methods exist to scaffold / seed the creation of a game / digital making community of learners? And what value does a community have?
- How can game patterns support the development of coding practices by novices?
- How can parent and child participant experiences of a community focused digital game making programme inform broader digital making practices? -->


### How Research Questions Evolved  

The process was driven by the activity of collaborative game making driven by practicalities, and my interests as explored in the first chapter.

As justified by DBR and formative interventions, the process was driven by a meeting of context and the needs / interests of myself as a researcher.

Possible themes that had potential but which were disguarded included;

- Computation thinking & systems thinking
- Aligning with Project based learning

Themes emerging include the alternation of abstract and concrete as a suggested learning journey, explored in my journal. However this seems to be explored in research on semantic waves with studies of more breadth so it did not seem a good idea to follow that thread in my thesis.

There was something about the formalisation of this process into graph form which put me off. I also realised that the frameworks that I spent a while trying to make accessible and gameful in the design, grouping and theming of their presentation, had strong similarities to concepts of abstract curriculum if explored through a semantic waves lens. Curriculum seemed too well a well trod path for a PhD thesis.  

Instead the community elements of the learning experience regained focus during the process of coding. There were particularly interesting elements of the learning environment which contributed to notable behaviours.

The area of in-depth study of learning and wider behaviours in the development of coding. Work on roles by Barron  and developed by Roque showed promise identifying helpful roles and reflecting them back to participants. Such reflection sessions were not always replicable with a general home education group or other non-formal setting.  Could this implemented in the design, in the way reflective techniques were implemented in to games. Thus making it more playful/ gameful.

### What research questions are answered by what data gathering and analysis - and described in what chapter?

 <!-- See the thesis by Digital Game Education: Designing interventions to encourage players’ informed reflections on their digital gaming practices Rafael Marques de Albuquerque
 As this is done very methodically
 -->


1.  What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to game coding and design?
2. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?
3. How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?


### RQ1

- Both barriers and tools / processes are explored in the literature review
- Interviews with practitioners in chapter 4 guided the design in broad principles.
- Barriers are explored in chapter 4 on evolution of the design
- Tools and processes in results chapters 5 and 6.

### RQ2

- Interviews with participants some informal and some formal instructed directly adaptations to design
- Analysis of video data


### RQ3

- Interviews with participants some informal and some formal instructed directly adaptations to design
- Analysis of video data



## Discussion on Methodology


### Discussion

NOTE - WHAT KIND OF DISCUSSION WOULD BE NEEDED HERE?
A RETURN TO POSSIBLE BARRIERS THAT THE METHODOLOGY AIMS TO OVER COME


Perhaps summarise the the context, and motivations of the above case studies are analysed in relation to the context of this study.

### Authenticity - creating value

 Barab and colleagues discuss the importance of creating value in the world in their ecosystem approach [@barnett_ecosystem_2019].
 This mirrors authenticity in applied social approaches - PBL as applied method of - situated learning ontology.




#### Note on creation of learning and teaching resources  

THIS IS COVERED IN THE NEXT CHATPER

The process of refining this reflection into learning and teaching resources was complex and iterative. The following paragraph illustrates the process using a case study?
[PERHAPS LOOK AT THE ELEMENTs OF A GAME DIVISION? - FINAL DESTINATION - SPACE, MECHANICS, POLISH]


How does this methodology relate / add to existing models?

## Transition to next Chapter - About the specifics of mutual evolution of Learning DESIGN


I conclude this chapter with a section that introduces the next chapter which is a rich description of the evolution of the learning design.

More than a design the result was a dynamic community which is analysed on several scopes of activity.

Before progressing to explore the details of the design, I want to briefly explore how this process brought into focus some of they key debates and issues of design based research.

- mutual appropriation and ethics of participation rather than extraction
- generating material suitable for sharing as research but also basis for starting other communities, be this via tools process or other
- the difficulties of transmitting research outcomes to non-academics - give positive examples.
-


<!-- Barab and Squire [-@barab_design-based_2004] describe the messiness of design-based research and that this creates a challenge to the researcher of how to present results in a coherent way which is of use to other practitioners. There is a tension between sticking closely to the context of the research and the concrete specifics or stepping back to generalise and being lost in abstraction. Here, I try to strike a balance which stays concrete but which also pulls from my observations a framework which may translate in to other game-making and creative project based approaches.

Another guiding principle of design-based research - which is present in the techniques of design experiments, mutual appropriation and participatory action research - is that research participants also influence the ongoing design of the research [@barab_critical_2004; @cobb_design_2003; @downing-wilson_design_2011]. The design of the research experiment and learning I started from a very open position and has evolved from several iterations of collaborative work with participants. One experimental team consisted of Home Educating families another involved local primary schools with Year 6 (10-11 year old) classes. Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly. Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture. -->





<!-- I have carried out six phases of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline the core activities that have taken place including only the most basic detail on tools used. In following sections, the development of toolsets are analysed in greater depth. The core of the game making programme, which emerged in the first phase and has remained, is a starting template of a simple platform game which participants alter to make their own. The evolution of different versions and locations of this starting template has proven to be a key marker of the progress of the programme. The timeline of phases of activities is outlined in the following table.
