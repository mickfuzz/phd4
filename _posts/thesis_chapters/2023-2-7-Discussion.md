- Analyse 3M design with this lens of agency
  - Game design to understanding games as a design artefact for empowerment purposes
  - Tension between walled garden and wider choice
- Compare key elements of 3M other studies in comping coding domain , primm, umc,
  - shifts in levels of abstraction
- Compare key elements of 3M - Then other more general frameworks , pbl, udl, cop, col - These differ in scope and specificity, and thus utility for practitioners
  - Start with motives? address transfer?
- Synthesis of conceptions of designing for learner agency in an emerging community of coders
  - compare Resnick / Paperts features of 'designing for tinkerability', with TADS and creating hooking points for double stimulation (warping anchors)
  - note different emphasis on the agency of the learner to one focusing on curriculum knowledge and resulting reccommendations
  - also compare concept of computational fluency of Resnick.
  - differing focus on the role of the designer
  - similarities in process - iterative, empowerment

## 3M through the lens of agency

In previous chapters, we have looked at broad conceptions of agency in the emergence of learning communities.
In this section I analyse the experience of learners in this study using some of the concepts and techniques of achieving agency to find matches and divergences.

### TADS - interventions and affordances as double stimulation

Revisiting terms; The term intervention and affordances do not nearly align with the broad conceptual framework of this study infering a duality between subject and object. FIND REFERENCE

Backwards and warping anchors.  

How does the process of offering out ledging points where anchors can catch, as a form of learning design match with conceptions of agency?

### Relational Agency - Edwards

Look at use of tools at the boundaries to construct new knowledge [cite - Building common knowledge at the boundaries between professional practices: Relational agency and relational expertise in systems of distributed expertise - Edwards]




## Synthesising the characteristics of the 3M pedagogy

3m This is a domain specific framework for teaching , can it have wider applications?  

If so how can characteristics be abstracted?

And if so are they distinct from existing frameworks explored in literature review?   

- Walled garden of limited design patterns
- Playful methods of community creation
- Drama narrative to create audience a la heathcote
- Regular informal feedback and chances to discuss evolving designs

#### Game design to understanding games as a design artefact for empowerment purposes - PERHAPS GOOD FOR CONCLUSION.

Bruno advocates process that expose that are surrounded by designed objects. This process of making lifts the lid on that process.

See example between helper and Pa in 2019-03-18 at the end. "It makes you think" . They marvel at the complexity of code needed to create even a simple game.

The motivation to allow participants to get under the hood of new technology is a foundation of many technical programs built on empowerment. We can take Mozilla, mouse, etc.

It is also present in design programs which take care to convey ethical perspectives as part of the design process as a way to counteract the possible effects of unindended side effects. This is especially relevant in the age of big data and highly powerful corporations.

Yet this approach is not without critique.

"Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.‚Äù  Friedrich Nietzsche

This expression, conveys a perspective that the medium is the message. By engaging with the technology its influences may permeate the subject.

This raises an additional question.
How can we help learners build agency in technological environmental without becoming monsters.


### Design patterns as a teaching aid / set of affordances in informal vs formal environments

TO DEVELOP OR MOVE back TO GDP CHAPTER

See journal notes and contrast with existing research with GDP and informal / formal coding programming debates.
Asking what does this research add to these debates?

Some of the following may be relevant;

- Learner choice and levels of abstraction techniques
- From the literature what are complexities involving the practitioner practicalities surrounding creating communities of coders
- What is special about the use of GDP in this 3M model?
- How is this model different from Game Jams in particular.
- Whereas Game Jams focus on x, 3m has a focus on y.
- Exploring GDP and different kinds of types of coding errors?

### Game Design Patterns vs CT and more established "knowledge"

My end design highlights game patterns as a starting point for user interest and to draw participants in to other elements of learning dimensions. More abstract dimensions like systems thinking, and more concrete like coding concepts.

- Compare formal teaching of CT and CS with an approach based on a freer choice of patterns.
- Discuss the use of gdps as a gateway to other concepts as explored in CS in a more abstract, and more concrete direction [@eriksson_using_2019] .

- Leading with GDP as a way to explore other Learning Dimensions
<!-- Draw on discussion in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1D-VhVj-NgN3qgk3YEx4HZEozf_1UOGtE -->

- Discussion - The use of GDPs hits a sweet spot as a "middle" level construct, (see Eriksson and Bjork)
- Discussion -  Rising to the concrete - as a key AT concept - how does this fit?


#### GDP, CT & Transfer
The heart of the matter here is how transferable knowledge is without a contextual meaning attached.  This is a contested area.
Firstly how wide should reuse be imagined? To other coding projects? Or wider claims as with Wing's interpretation of CT.

#### Technical of 3M concepts suiting transfer

Learning maps - additional discussion on learning dimensions - or conclusion / next steps.

While there are technical elements of transfer that were identified and included in the learning map I sidelined the study of them.

Specifically in examining the concrete implementation of GDPs there are transferrable concepts and practice involving practice which include;

- Use of levels as a array which is parsed by a loop to create layout
- Logic statements of varied degrees of complexity
- Functions - code patching into the right area



### Commentary of CT in the 3M model in particular

Brief commentary on discussion  on the practical value of CT concepts

NOTE - Shift some material here from previous chapter.

Developing understanding of CT concepts in isolation is a potentially weak point of the 3M approach in comparison to from first principles approach. However the process of patching into different areas of the code and creating functions does address this. The following transcript of Sh's interaction with myself shows that the process of copying patterns in the template code and patching in new lines from the supporting documentation gives ample opportunity for sequencing mistakes to be made. The process of working with students on their existing code is valuable to explain why and how the order of lines of code and when functions are called.

 The comparison raises a potential discussion point on what the practical value of this CT concept is.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses of the GDP construct / terminology

PERHAPS MOVE TO DESIGN?
The interpretation of GDP that this thesis adopts contains some weaknesses. The specificity of the term is weak in that in seeking to categorise a wide diversity of features that participants would want to add to the game to fulfil a pedagogical motivation of providing guidance and inspiration to the novice designers. The pragmatic nature of this interpretation can be contrasted to more formal definitions of say Game Mechanics related to user actions in the game [@sicart_defining_2008].

<!-- NOTE -  THIS CAN BE EXPANDED
more n Game Mechanics etc
-->
The term is particularly week in the area of Game Polish which involved were more aesthetic and narrative choices.

[]

These choices do not fall neatly in to the argument being constructed around the potential of GDPs to unlock repeatable, transferable practices. For example, some participants, specifically one who came as a friend of of others and didn't have direct parental help, spent a majority of time working on these patterns especially if assets are being replaced.

It is perhaps the term _pattern_ that is problematic here. It may imply a repeatable structural element rather than an aesthetic choices. Other academics have given a wider name of game elements [@tekinbas_gaming_2014] or lenses [@schell_art_2008].

#### On CTs and CTs emerging in the wild.

As explored in a previous chapter, the 3M design leads with concrete game design patterns chosen by participants. This approach can be compared to others which lead with more abstract computational thinking concepts which are introduced and explicitly taught from first principles.

However, while not explicitly taught, the CT concepts are contained within the learning dimensions of the 3M model allowing participants and especially facilitators to be aware of examples of practice allowing for development of these skills. This section explores examples of CT in action that emerge from video data of game making.  

NOTE - A quick summary of examples?


##### Compare formal teaching of CT and CS with an approach based on a freer choice of patterns.

The design choice of leading with GDP was based on increasing the agency of participants over the pathway of their design activities.
LINK TO LITERATURE ON CHOICE AND ENGAGEMENT.

It is problematic to compare participants engagement with this learning design with another fictional game where they learn CT concepts first and then put them into practice.

However, it is helpful to identify key characteristics of the design which run counter to a principles first approach and describe how participants experienced these elements.

Elements of contrast with 3M include;

- The remix element of code (explored in previous methods chapter perhaps) - which allows participants to add new features quickly. They can also see and replicate existing patterns in the  code. This could compare to many hours writing from scratch and many abstract concepts explained before getting to anything looking like a game.
- Lack of value placed on CT as overarching knowledge. No posters, no curriculum content, no tests on concepts, no lesson objectives and end tests,
- Code patching from existing code examples, as previously explored, allows for participants to take code and add it into their game without full knowledge of the syntactical complexities of each line they use.


##  Commentary / Discussion on Learning Dimensions

More discussion  on the practical value of CT concepts

### CT as a practical skill or a more abstract concept.

A general discussion of varied views and my own based on data of this study.

### It's fun but are they learning
Exploring the tactic of reflective practices to back up CTs being found in the wild. Both for practitioner and participants as per [@petrich_it_2013].


### Discussion on UMC and PRIMM in relation to use of 3M model (Practitioner focus)

- UMC - should also be covered in the Remix part of the design ?

<!-- not sure how much to put in about this in LIT REVIEW  -->
Note on PRIMM and personal knowledge.

Recap on PRIMM ? - THIS WILL BE IN LIT REVIEW MOST PROBABLY

Da and Te - In these interaction the parent seems keen for the child to be able to express and demonstrate their personal knowledge of coding, games and maths concepts.

This is an interaction which in some ways is comparable to the PRIMM model which is suggested for classroom use. However to do it in the way demonstrated by this pair would involve a level of coding familiarity, and ongoing familiarity with the structure and thinking of the participant which would be difficult to achieve in many classrooms.

UMC on the other hand while being less described and open to interpretation seems to match the more informal, iterative game making of many participants.

### Different strokes

A different strokes commentary. Depending on aims of the practitioner and context of the game making different tactics may be applicable.


## Representing Coded the Patterns of Activity via coded data

NOTE - NOT SURE WHERE TO PUT THIS PART OR IF THE CHART ELEMENT IS REALLY VALUABLE -
IT COULD BE A DISTRACTION
SO HERE AS A POSSIBILITY IN CONCLUSION - could be moved?

ANOTHER NOTE - I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO DO THE ACTUAL CHARTS OR WORK WITH THE 5 FULLY CODED VIDEOS YET.

We can to examine patterns of activity is through an analysis of the coded video interactions. The coding structure decided upon and the process of coding in five minutes sections.

<!-- NOTE - there may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granuar detail if this process is useful.  -->

Note The full coding scheme will be included here.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit?usp=sharing

The main schemes as below.

- Design Stages -
- Interaction Description -
- Game Elements Addressed (Game Polish, Game Space, Game Mechanics, Game Challenge(remove?))

The process of coding data shed light onto patterns of activity in creating a list of general behaviours shared by participants and thus also identifying outlying behaviours that did not meet the emerging coding scheme. (NOTE FOR HERE OR PREVIOUS?)

Later in the chapter the limits of the chosen design stage schema are explored as a way of illuminating interesting game making behaviour of participants.

<!-- See current table here.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit?usp=sharing -->

In the following section I use key tools provided by the research software Nvivo to give insight about the engagement of participants by compare time on different tasks.

<!-- For example for the session that the vignette was taken from the below is chart of the time on each of the codes. -->

The coding structure (may) also allows to show the overlap between different code areas. This is useful to explore a question like the following:

- Question One: During which design phase does parent-child pair interaction happen most frequently?
- Question Two: What are the different patterns for participant interaction that happen when working on different game elements?

TO COME.

The first scenario represented in a chart which compares activity grouping with design stages and activity description.

Pair work -> TEST, CREATE, IMPROVE, etc
Peer work -> TEST, CREATE, IMPROVE, etc
Solo work -> perhaps dont an

CHART

The second scenario is represented by pie charts for each game element showing the duration spent on each by a diversity of participants.  

CHART

#### Discussion on data
<!-- NOTE - MOVE THIS? DOESN'T SEEM TO FLOW IN THIS SECTION -->

For the first question only suitable pairs were chosen. This removes a lot of validity from any generalisation of claims that could be made.
This approach has some clear limits. Firstly the breaking of data into 5 min sections is practical but does not allow for some of the finer interactions and changes of behaviour to be accurately coded.  There may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granular detail.

The game elements / design patterns categories which are presented are created as a design guide rather than on exact principles.
It is possible to code drilling down into another level. This might yield more results.

In summary, the coding process is more valuable as a tool to allow more qualitative reflection and analysis rather than a quantitative process as attempted above.

To make a quantitative approach work better X,Y and Z would need to be in place which was not suitable for this study because of A and B.

<!-- By coding the activity of the child and the adult for this session in depth the following representation of how the child spent their time is available.

- time under table
- time in control of Keyboard
- time actively directing parent's activity
- time actively observing parent's activity
- time discussing game features with parent -->



## Design stages or flexible design practices

Surfacing maker types (as per player types) can encourage epistemological pluralism [Papert] or flexible design practices.



### Shifts in design practice

NOTE - Preceeding To follow shifts in perspectives bound up in designing for others, and the shift in layers of abstraction,

This section explores what other shifts in design practices



#### Alternating coding

Sh and Th
The parent cedes the keyboard and mouse and sometimes swaps chairs to allow child to play test the game created.

This follows a pattern of X   


#### **Shifting between Facilitator and more active partner**

At one point the testing process here is quite frustrating as gravity value is very low making any movement very slow with little control. While the child has previously rejected increasing the value, the parent's initial acceptance of this decision is later questioned. The parent who has to do the majority of the testing is more insistent to remove a frustrating part of the testing  process.  

Discussion drawing on more radical attempts to describe the best way to bring young learners into a design practice.
Perhaps in the field of participatory design.


#### **Rapid prototyping**

As per Te and Da - example in previous chapter where the preview window replaced paper prototyping, rapids shifts between code and game are optimal and build a particular fluidity of practice

- Well suited to build a repeated design practice.
- Especially with starting documents,
- Small changes had big effects.
- Variable changes needed immediate testing.  

While the design suits repeated design practice as illustrated by the example above, not all pairs or individuals interacted with GDP in such a neat way.

A later discussion section in this chapter illustrates a more complex interaction with design stages.



### Design (not GDP) supports Flexible Design Practices - Discussion? MOVE?

HOW EXACTLY? FOR NOW THIS SECTION IS A SUB SECTION MINI DISCUSSION.
HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO LATER DISCUSSION ON MINI JAMS ETC.
SHOULD THIS TALK OF DESIGNING FOR LEARNER AGENCY AND FOR DIFFERENT MAKING STYLES BE INCLUDED IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER  ON INTERVENTION METHODS?

Previously a broad range of observed design practices of participants which involve game design patterns were observed. The overall direction of the section is that it is beneficial to creative a community where there is a diversity of approaches being undertaken but with some underlying shared themes and practices.

Iterative agile design is a highly cultural / interpersonal process. (Glossary)

QUESTION - INCLUDE THIS OR NOT?
As discussed a in previous section design thinking education has created a set norms in communicating the stages of design that complexities are less readily communicated. On closer inspection, much literature on design processes contains caveats that some processes can happen in parallel and one stage may need several iterations. Given this caveat, I began to how useful is the overall in observing the emergence of complex creative processes.

To address this, this section looks as some of the emerging patterns which complexify the emerging norms of design thinking education.  *if that's useful that is - if not just describe complexities*

 <!-- https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/principles/design-systems/design-thinking-process/ -->


### NOTE - MOVED FROM ANALYSIS OF TH AND SH Vingette Describing design stages for this pair beyond this interaction

 <!-- NOTE - This section may move to a (previous) chapter (provisionally structured around inclusive methods) - of which overall interaction with design stages could be one aspect.
 As such observations are listed in bullet point in case a lot restructuring is needed. -->

 <!-- NOTE -  the chapter is moving towards GDP as main activity unit. or is this already addresAs sed in Methodology / Design
  -->

 <!-- As mentioned in the previous sections, after analysis of this vignette in particular, it seemed promising to investigate behaviour and engagement at different stages of design process for this pair. To do this I have made extensive notes and used a coding structure for two complete sessions of this parent-child pair. The following observations have been made by comparing the codes on stages of design and types of participant interaction. This data was then triangulated participant feedback and my own journal notes. The observations are presented themed by the design stages used in the coding process with some general observations listed at the end of this section. -->

 <!-- NOTE PERHAPS MOVE THE GENERAL OBSERVATIONS TO THE END OF THIS SECTION AS DISCUSSION OR SOME WHERE EVEN LATER. OR ANOTHER Chapter
 REWRITE TO KEEP FOCUSED ON DESIGN PATTERNS.
   -->


#### Discussion on design stages and GDP for this pair

 <!-- - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities. -->
 This parent was much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents. The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker/player type (concepts explored in previous chapter). This interpretation seems confirmed by less social interactions compared to may parents. The pair engaged far less in play testing of other games and peer support to overcome barriers. They also followed the stages of design more closely than may other groupings, an observation which is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

 This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." This alternation is driven or facilitated by the different stages of implementing GDPs. The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

 Using the coded data from nvivo to compare design cycle stages with pair collaboration, it can be observed that the most likely stages for pair collaboration were during the Ask/Imagine stage, Testing and Planning.

 The vignette shows evidence of that the actions of the parent to re-engage the child at different stages of the design cycle helped sustain the child's engagement in the more focused design process happening on the screen. However, an opposing pattern of behaviour may also be valid. When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups. Within Rogoff's model of community of learners [-@rogoff_developing_1994], this observation is viewed as valid form of participation. The child's ability to legitimately disengage from pair coding to observe the work and interactions of others in this emerging community of learners may also be sustaining.

 It is of note that when describing the design cycle for this family that this family along with others are working with decomposed smaller design challenges in the form of implementing GDPs. Thus the cycle is repeated for each new pattern that the pair take on. These smaller design iterations can be expressed within the framework of AT as an activity system.

 <!-- #### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

 NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION?
  NOTE - This more general observation may be part of the previous chapter

 We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

 - The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
 - This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

 Discussion

 - The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

 The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity. -->




#### The limits of design cycle stages

When coding data a design cycle framework was one of the code structures. REFER BACK TO ENGINEERING SOURCE.
Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share.

While design cycles was not an explicitly part of the game making instruction, certain interventions supported this approach. In particular the use of maps as a planning and reflection tool and the use of playtesting as a social and personal form of evaluation of emerging designs.

When coding I quick became aware of the limits and challenges to coding to this.

For example a lot of time in this informal game-making sessions were spent on activities outside of this cycle.
For example, opening up the right tools, navigating to correct locations and finding past assets involved a fair deal of effort and collaboration.

I have been pragmatic and map elements like this these loosely. Where appropriate I make notes on that activity in free form areas of other documents like spreadsheets.

This limits claims I can make from the coded data. However it raises interesting points which merit discussion.

#### Value Faff Time.
So much of the creative process is faffing. More precisely many creative moments happen in times not neatly represented in the cycle.
For example the navigation to the right location in creative software, finding assets, migrating assets between authoring tools, converting to correct formats, evaluating new tools.

This is something that I do not have a precise name for. I call it digital laundry or digital housekeeping. Things that at times can be low attention span or which can be extremely frustrating like needing to tidy up so you can find your car keys.
There is frustration here, but there are also moments of creativity, and there are bonding moments which are undirected activity but shared.  
For example.....

#### Improving is Creating and Planning when remixing

For example when altering jump and move variable for the first time. They are deliberately set low. Thus while technically this is improving the code. As the participant is meeting those variable for the first time we can recategorise in the create category.

CASE - One parent did extensive design and then altered the variables at the end. Mi -

<!-- Exerpt Mi - 2019-03-08 - 52 mins -->

#### Digital Jamming

This has an example in the use of sound making software Fi & Ma -
The process of tinkering and messing spurs creativity that doesn't map to a design cycle.

They are in an evaluation of tools which could be said to be in planning stage,
However this quickly become creation as they decide the spontaneously created music is preferable to the one created using a different tool at home.

The joint jamming then has created two different soundtracks. This sparks a new thought to create different soundtracks for different levels.
This would fit within the Imagine stage.
Plan then Create then Imagine then Revise all in the space of a minute.

Implication one - When mapping the activity to a design cycle. There may not be neat matches and at some stage if the process is very fragmented the researcher or teacher can legitimately ask how valuable the design cycle is as a planning or analytical tool. Other less formulaic theoretical perspectives on creative processes exist including rhizomatic approaches [@de_freitas_classroom_2012]. And some attempts have been made to incorporate design thinking with a rhizomatic approach [@biffi_chasing_2017-1].

Implication two -when designing a program and thinking of how to present the process to participants, over structuring around a design cycle approach may be not be productive or accurate.
Question? How does this relate to tinkering methodology?
What other framework would be suitable here?


#### Discussion - encouraging improvisation in the design process.

<!--
Pumping up the Jam
- -->

In many interactions we see improvisational approaches.

Example from Te and Da - 2019-05-08 -

    Da- use paper to design
    Te - I'm just going with it

The tools, process and the community encourage a jam / improvisational approach. Remixing, chipping away, a shattering of design cycles. More of an informal approach

The concept of Jam is explored in rapid, improvisational events called Game Jams.

Some of the following sections discuss design factors and participant responses which fit this category of informal creative practices.
player types


#### Example: Fluidity of design practice

Another example shows an evolving fluidity in response. Ch incorporates a boost to player health after a level after being given feedback during playtesting.

Other participants also demonstrate fluidity of response although to a less sophisticated degree. The process of altering design especially suits a fluid response as makers build their design skills by rapidly altering  

This is participatory appropriation in that it is a new GDP that stems from original thinking on the part of the participant.  



## Thoughts Log - things that may end up here.

### GDPs that are already in the template

Some GDPs were not made a part of the menu of options as they were already in the template.
For example Reward.

Is this a missed opportunity to surface and discuss those patterns? cf [@eriksson_using_2019]

### Breaking out of the walled garden:

Te and Da's decision to explore a different starting point and add uncharted GDPs like following enemies.
A potential tension which was resolved quickly in some ways.
But at the cost of maintaining a working game.
