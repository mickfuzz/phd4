## Outline notes


- Discussion around agency: Compare agency in design to different conception in research Tads sannino, relational etc
- Analyse 3M design with this lens of agency
  - Tension between walled garden and wider choice
- Compare key elements of 3M other studies in comping coding domain , primm, umc,
  - shifts in levels of abstraction 
- Compare key elements of 3M - Then other more general frameworks , pbl, udl, cop, col - These differ in scope and specificity, and thus utility for practitioners

## 3M through the lens of agency

In previous chapters, we have looked at broad conceptions of agency in the emergence of learning communities.
In this section I analyse the experience of learners in this study using some of the concepts and techniques of achieving agency to find matches and divergences.

### TADS - interventions and affordances as double stimulation

Revisiting terms; The term intervention and affordances do not nearly align with the broad conceptual framework of this study infering a duality between subject and object. FIND REFERENCE

Backwards and warping anchors.  

How does the process of offering out ledging points where anchors can catch, as a form of learning design match with conceptions of agency?

### Relational Agency - Edwards

Look at use of tools at the boundaries to construct new knowledge [cite - Building common knowledge at the boundaries between professional practices: Relational agency and relational expertise in systems of distributed expertise - Edwards]

## Synthesising the characteristics of the 3M pedagogy

3m This is a domain specific framework for teaching , can it have wider applications?  

If so how can characteristics be abstracted?

And if so are they distinct from existing frameworks explored in literature review?   

- Walled garden of limited design patterns
- Playful methods of community creation
- Drama narrative to create audience a la heathcote
- Regular informal feedback and chances to discuss evolving designs



### Game Design Patterns vs CT and more established "knowledge"

THIS SECTION PROBABLY MOSTLY OR FULLY BELONGS IN THE NEXT CHAPTER

My end design highlights game patterns as a starting point for user interest and to draw participants in to other elements of learning dimensions. More abstract dimensions like systems thinking, and more concrete like coding concepts.

- Compare formal teaching of CT and CS with an approach based on a freer choice of patterns.
- Discuss the use of gdps as a gateway to other concepts as explored in CS in a more abstract, and more concrete direction [@eriksson_using_2019] .

- Leading with GDP as a way to explore other Learning Dimensions
<!-- Draw on discussion in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1D-VhVj-NgN3qgk3YEx4HZEozf_1UOGtE -->

- Discussion - The use of GDPs hits a sweet spot as a "middle" level construct, (see Eriksson and Bjork)
- Discussion -  Rising to the concrete - as a key AT concept - how does this fit?


#### On CTs and CTs emerging in the wild.

As explored in a previous chapter, the 3M design leads with concrete game design patterns chosen by participants. This approach can be compared to others which lead with more abstract computational thinking concepts which are introduced and explicitly taught from first principles.

However, while not explicitly taught, the CT concepts are contained within the learning dimensions of the 3M model allowing participants and especially facilitators to be aware of examples of practice allowing for development of these skills. This section explores examples of CT in action that emerge from video data of game making.  

NOTE - A quick summary of examples?


##### Compare formal teaching of CT and CS with an approach based on a freer choice of patterns.

The design choice of leading with GDP was based on increasing the agency of participants over the pathway of their design activities.
LINK TO LITERATURE ON CHOICE AND ENGAGEMENT.

It is problematic to compare participants engagement with this learning design with another fictional game where they learn CT concepts first and then put them into practice.

However, it is helpful to identify key characteristics of the design which run counter to a principles first approach and describe how participants experienced these elements.

Elements of contrast with 3M include;

- The remix element of code (explored in previous methods chapter perhaps) - which allows participants to add new features quickly. They can also see and replicate existing patterns in the  code. This could compare to many hours writing from scratch and many abstract concepts explained before getting to anything looking like a game.
- Lack of value placed on CT as overarching knowledge. No posters, no curriculum content, no tests on concepts, no lesson objectives and end tests,
- Code patching from existing code examples, as previously explored, allows for participants to take code and add it into their game without full knowledge of the syntactical complexities of each line they use.


##### CTs emerging in the wild.
There are several examples of CT arising in the wild without being explicitly taught.
Here the focus is on Wing's narrower take rather than including general practices.


#### Decomposition.
in 2019-05-08-te-da - Da the parent suggests revisions to the agreed overall goal which break a larger problems into more manageable steps.
It can be legitimately questioned if this is a specialist skill rather than general good creative practice.

#### Abstraction
This concept can be concretely taught using the code structure of functions -

There is scope for doing this. In my journal notes and notes following interactions I notice when there is a call for a new function.

#### Generalisation / Pattern recognition

Present in the work of Te to find patterns and to duplicate them in different situations.
2019-05-08-te - With prompting from parent the child is able to recognise, duplicate and alter the update code for accepting left and right key input to change character x-axis velocity. After update and test iterations they change this to up and down key input to update y-axis velocity.  
NOTE - Ideally find another example of a child doing this.

The 3M approach lends itself well to exploring pattern recognition as patterns are readily available to participants in starting code and the extra patches that are added.

Also the knowledge of the GDP helps ability to recognise patterns in the code. Left / right -> Up / Down

#### Sequencing / Algorithms.

Sequencing and writing algorithms is one of the most common CT principles explored in research. INCLUDE CITATION.

This is a relative weak point in comparison to from first principles approach.

However the process of patching into different areas of the code and creating functions does address this.

The following transcript of Sh's interaction with myself shows that the process of copying patterns in the template code and patching in new lines from the supporting documentation gives ample opportunity for sequencing mistakes to be made.
The process of working with students on their existing code is valuable to explain why and how the order of lines of code and when functions are called.

The comparison raises a potential discussion point on what the practical value of this CT concept is.

### Commentary of CT in the 3M model in particular
More discussion  on the practical value of CT concepts

##  Commentary / Discussion on Learning Dimensions

More discussion  on the practical value of CT concepts

### CT as a practical skill or a more abstract concept.

A general discussion of varied views and my own based on data of this study.

### It's fun but are they learning
Exploring the tactic of reflective practices to back up CTs being found in the wild. Both for practitioner and participants as per [@petrich_it_2013].


### Discussion on UMC and PRIMM in relation to use of 3M model (Practitioner focus)

- UMC - should also be covered in the Remix part of the design ?

<!-- not sure how much to put in about this in LIT REVIEW  -->
Note on PRIMM and personal knowledge.

Recap on PRIMM ? - THIS WILL BE IN LIT REVIEW MOST PROBABLY

Da and Te - In these interaction the parent seems keen for the child to be able to express and demonstrate their personal knowledge of coding, games and maths concepts.

This is an interaction which in some ways is comparable to the PRIMM model which is suggested for classroom use. However to do it in the way demonstrated by this pair would involve a level of coding familiarity, and ongoing familiarity with the structure and thinking of the participant which would be difficult to achieve in many classrooms.

UMC on the other hand while being less described and open to interpretation seems to match the more informal, iterative game making of many participants.

### Different strokes

A different strokes commentary. Depending on aims of the practitioner and context of the game making different tactics may be applicable.







## Representing Coded the Patterns of Activity via coded data

NOTE - NOT SURE WHERE TO PUT THIS PART OR IF THE CHART ELEMENT IS REALLY VALUABLE -
IT COULD BE A DISTRACTION
SO HERE AS A POSSIBILITY IN CONCLUSION - could be moved?

ANOTHER NOTE - I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO DO THE ACTUAL CHARTS OR WORK WITH THE 5 FULLY CODED VIDEOS YET.

We can to examine patterns of activity is through an analysis of the coded video interactions. The coding structure decided upon and the process of coding in five minutes sections.

<!-- NOTE - there may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granuar detail if this process is useful.  -->

Note The full coding scheme will be included here.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit?usp=sharing

The main schemes as below.

- Design Stages -
- Interaction Description -
- Game Elements Addressed (Game Polish, Game Space, Game Mechanics, Game Challenge(remove?))

The process of coding data shed light onto patterns of activity in creating a list of general behaviours shared by participants and thus also identifying outlying behaviours that did not meet the emerging coding scheme. (NOTE FOR HERE OR PREVIOUS?)

Later in the chapter the limits of the chosen design stage schema are explored as a way of illuminating interesting game making behaviour of participants.

<!-- See current table here.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit?usp=sharing -->

In the following section I use key tools provided by the research software Nvivo to give insight about the engagement of participants by compare time on different tasks.

<!-- For example for the session that the vignette was taken from the below is chart of the time on each of the codes. -->

The coding structure (may) also allows to show the overlap between different code areas. This is useful to explore a question like the following:

- Question One: During which design phase does parent-child pair interaction happen most frequently?
- Question Two: What are the different patterns for participant interaction that happen when working on different game elements?

TO COME.

The first scenario represented in a chart which compares activity grouping with design stages and activity description.

Pair work -> TEST, CREATE, IMPROVE, etc
Peer work -> TEST, CREATE, IMPROVE, etc
Solo work -> perhaps dont an

CHART

The second scenario is represented by pie charts for each game element showing the duration spent on each by a diversity of participants.

#### Discussion on data
<!-- NOTE - MOVE THIS? DOESN'T SEEM TO FLOW IN THIS SECTION -->

For the first question only suitable pairs were chosen. This removes a lot of validity from any generalisation of claims that could be made.
This approach has some clear limits. Firstly the breaking of data into 5 min sections is practical but does not allow for some of the finer interactions and changes of behaviour to be accurately coded.  There may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granular detail.

The game elements / design patterns categories which are presented are created as a design guide rather than on exact principles.
It is possible to code drilling down into another level. This might yield more results.

In summary, the coding process is more valuable as a tool to allow more qualitative reflection and analysis rather than a quantitative process as attempted above.

To make a quantitative approach work better X,Y and Z would need to be in place which was not suitable for this study because of A and B.

<!-- By coding the activity of the child and the adult for this session in depth the following representation of how the child spent their time is available.

- time under table
- time in control of Keyboard
- time actively directing parent's activity
- time actively observing parent's activity
- time discussing game features with parent -->
