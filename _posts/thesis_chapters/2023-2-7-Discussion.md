<!--
## Starting thoughts on writing up results.

The 3M model as a pedagogical model which aligns with PBL principles and more general social approach to learning coding.
A start here of mapping in a Matrix that could be included in a concluding chapter.

## Introduction

The findings of this chapter broadly align with the personal foci from Rogoff's three foci model.
The results of this chapter are drawn from journal entries and from the reflection on resources design which happens over several iterations of the game making design.

These include resources created after, and partly in response to, the interactions documented in the previous chapter.

One of the aims of adapting and extending resources to facilitate the use of key techniques that emerged in the early design stages in more restricted and structured environments, e.g. a computing classroom in secondary school.

<!-- A theme to follow up in the Maps / personal learning chapter is that of picking up on some of the behaviour of participants, especially that of experienced parents, experience either in coding practices of supporting their children. Once identified, how could beneficial interactions be encouraged in the next iteration of design.

Examples include;

- supporting reflection on design and coding concepts / skills.
- navigation / organisational support - use of a physical map.

For example, the use of CT concepts in a framework, listed as part of the initial design pattern card, which could then be discussed, ticked off or otherwise reflected on. -->


## On Evolution of Supporting Resources

The resource creation was driven by wider concerns which prioritise this more individual account of learning.  Elements have been introduced to make this process potentially adaptable to classroom. This has influenced use based on curriculum.

Not in any particular order.

- recap of use of resources by 'planners', and feedback wanting a more standard approach
- tensions in planning and writing FM book, return to resources to explain the "meeting in the middle" as a possible resolution
- tension of printed or online documents - needs of my study - what was helpful to learners
- learning dimensions map - a pathway for learners, and planning document for facilitators, this repetoire of patterns in partnership with routes to explore more abstract and applied terminology
 - mapping learning journeys, patchy experiments and further work.




### MOVED/ COPIED FROM DESIGN AT END  Personal Dimension of the Learning - Personal Appropriation

 In line with sociocultural approaches Rogoff points out the limits of an understanding of knowledge which promotes a view of knowledge as transmission from teacher to learner and is thus an individual process. Instead this exploration of knowledge and practices is framed as a mutual process.

 While, this is potentially problematic in classroom environments, the mutuality of the process is evident in my responses to tensions via changes in design and spontaneous practices and understandings of knowledge required to make games enacted by participants.  

 One significant tension I felt in evolving design was a nagging feeling that learning happening should be documented, or linked to some kind of curriculum. There are elements of the design which suit development of coding concepts and Computational Thinking.
 However, I felt reluctance to explicitly teach these links via direct transmission.



## Learning Dimensions Map

### Overview
In learning environments where there is a lot of choice assessing learners via observation is beneficial. Rather than deciding what you want to teach and testing students on that area, you can map the learning happening in an authentic activity. When researching hands-on tinkering in Science museums Bevan and Petrich [-@petrich_it_2013] worked with educators to examine video footage of families interacting with exhibits to make a structured list of the learning they observed. The resulting map of learning dimensions included underlying science concepts but also contained more general skills and helping behaviours involved in exploratory learning processes. Another chapter in this collection identified concept maps and observation as methods for teachers and researchers to identify key learning suited to particular computing projects. One of the outcomes of my research was to extract some of the concepts and practices that learners engaged with when making games from hours of recorded material. While some are common to existing Computational Thinking frameworks others, including systems thinking concepts, are more unique to game making. Table 1.1. shows my resulting map of learning dimensions for the 3M game making model.

|      Coding Concepts    | Systems Patterns    | Design Practices|
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Sequences | Systems Elements      | Goal Setting        |
| Variables      | Systems Dynamics  | Being Incremental and Iterative       |
| Logic | Reinforcing Feedback Loops      | Developing Vocabulary        |
| Loops | Balancing Feedback Loops      | Web Navigation    |
| Arrays |       | Problem Solving        |
| Creating Functions |       | Version Control    |
| Change Listener |    | Debugging   |
| Input Event |   | Reusing and Remixing      |

Table 1.1. Learning Dimensions of the 3M Game Making Model

This process of mapping such frameworks may be overly time-consuming for many full-time teachers. However, teachers may also use and adapt existing maps and frameworks based on their own classroom experience to help their observation of students. Because these frameworks can also help students to navigate their own learning journey the effort serves a double purpose.

<!--
While this is an informal way of using maps the are other approaches that are more formal including one called a concept map which is a visual representation of target specialised knowledge. There is a section on concept maps as part of the teach computing website here. https://blog.teachcomputing.org/how-we-teach-computing/. -->

### Limits to this map

This map was designed to link with particular conceptions of learning whilst still retaining a sense of the uniqueness of the affordances of this design. The settings are, CT in school curriculums, systems thinking, design approaches. These align broadly with a STEM approach. The rationale behind this is that Game Making commonly aligns with these curriculum areas and they are particularly suited to explore via iterative game making.
NOTE - EXPLAIN WHERE THAT IS EXPLORED IN MORE DETAIL.

However, there are a broad range of other skills and literacies also relevant with evidence emerging in video data.

My own work in this area has been informed by work developing teaching materials for the Mozilla Foundation as part of the Teach the Web programme. This programme introduced a broad set of competencies name Web Literacies [@noauthor_learning/webliteracystandard/legacy/webliteracieswhitepaper_nodate] [@mozilla_foundation_webmaker_2014].

- digital literacy - broad overview
- web literacy - narrower
- webmaker - and more specific affordances of key web based coding and exploring tools


<!-- NOTE EXPAND IF USEFUL -->
Note - while the use of these skills is not unique to game making and common to pick up on many making situations, the use of external image and sound asset creation tools which then creates production pipeline process does engender key navigation and importing and exporting skills which are very valuable in online environments.

NOTE - The map could easily be changed to reflect this or other foci of teachers / researchers.


## Adaptations to the 3M model to facilitate the use of Learning Dimensions map

### Addition of a Game Challenge section

I wanted to explore the possibility to use this model to explore systems thinking.
There is precedent to do this in GSM.
It was driven in a response to meaningful missions which helped guide a focus on game play.
I created such missions (outlined in Methods chapter)
Added game design patterns based on challenge - find source Schnell & GSM literature (their terminology is Game elements)
And then updated the learning map to highlight potential concepts to be learned.


### Including Coding Concepts in the Learning Map and including Code Cards with links to online Concepts

Recap here the choice of coding concepts rather that CT in more abstract terms.


- Make Code cards which contained links to game design patterns and the different component concepts
- (see Eriksson and Bjork)
- Draw on material and critique in chapter on semantic profiles / waves.





### Game Design Patterns vs CT and more established "knowledge"

THIS SECTION PROBABLY MOSTLY OR FULLY BELONGS IN THE NEXT CHAPTER

My end design highlights game patterns as a starting point for user interest and to draw participants in to other elements of learning dimensions. More abstract dimensions like systems thinking, and more concrete like coding concepts.

- Compare formal teaching of CT and CS with an approach based on a freer choice of patterns.
- Discuss the use of gdps as a gateway to other concepts as explored in CS in a more abstract, and more concrete direction [@eriksson_using_2019] .

- Leading with GDP as a way to explore other Learning Dimensions
<!-- Draw on discussion in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1D-VhVj-NgN3qgk3YEx4HZEozf_1UOGtE -->

- Discussion - The use of GDPs hits a sweet spot as a "middle" level construct, (see Eriksson and Bjork)
- Discussion -  Rising to the concrete - as a key AT concept - how does this fit?


#### On CTs and CTs emerging in the wild.

As explored in a previous chapter, the 3M design leads with concrete game design patterns chosen by participants. This approach can be compared to others which lead with more abstract computational thinking concepts which are introduced and explicitly taught from first principles.

However, while not explicitly taught, the CT concepts are contained within the learning dimensions of the 3M model allowing participants and especially facilitators to be aware of examples of practice allowing for development of these skills. This section explores examples of CT in action that emerge from video data of game making.  

NOTE - A quick summary of examples?


##### Compare formal teaching of CT and CS with an approach based on a freer choice of patterns.

The design choice of leading with GDP was based on increasing the agency of participants over the pathway of their design activities.
LINK TO LITERATURE ON CHOICE AND ENGAGEMENT.

It is problematic to compare participants engagement with this learning design with another fictional game where they learn CT concepts first and then put them into practice.

However, it is helpful to identify key characteristics of the design which run counter to a principles first approach and describe how participants experienced these elements.

Elements of contrast with 3M include;

- The remix element of code (explored in previous methods chapter perhaps) - which allows participants to add new features quickly. They can also see and replicate existing patterns in the  code. This could compare to many hours writing from scratch and many abstract concepts explained before getting to anything looking like a game.
- Lack of value placed on CT as overarching knowledge. No posters, no curriculum content, no tests on concepts, no lesson objectives and end tests,
- Code patching from existing code examples, as previously explored, allows for participants to take code and add it into their game without full knowledge of the syntactical complexities of each line they use.


##### CTs emerging in the wild.
There are several examples of CT arising in the wild without being explicitly taught.
Here the focus is on Wing's narrower take rather than including general practices.


#### Decomposition.
in 2019-05-08-te-da - Da the parent suggests revisions to the agreed overall goal which break a larger problems into more manageable steps.
It can be legitimately questioned if this is a specialist skill rather than general good creative practice.

#### Abstraction
This concept can be concretely taught using the code structure of functions -

There is scope for doing this. In my journal notes and notes following interactions I notice when there is a call for a new function.

#### Generalisation / Pattern recognition

Present in the work of Te to find patterns and to duplicate them in different situations.
2019-05-08-te - With prompting from parent the child is able to recognise, duplicate and alter the update code for accepting left and right key input to change character x-axis velocity. After update and test iterations they change this to up and down key input to update y-axis velocity.  
NOTE - Ideally find another example of a child doing this.

The 3M approach lends itself well to exploring pattern recognition as patterns are readily available to participants in starting code and the extra patches that are added.

Also the knowledge of the GDP helps ability to recognise patterns in the code. Left / right -> Up / Down

#### Sequencing / Algorithms.

Sequencing and writing algorithms is one of the most common CT principles explored in research. INCLUDE CITATION.

This is a relative weak point in comparison to from first principles approach.

However the process of patching into different areas of the code and creating functions does address this.

The following transcript of Sh's interaction with myself shows that the process of copying patterns in the template code and patching in new lines from the supporting documentation gives ample opportunity for sequencing mistakes to be made.
The process of working with students on their existing code is valuable to explain why and how the order of lines of code and when functions are called.

The comparison raises a potential discussion point on what the practical value of this CT concept is.

### Commentary of CT in the 3M model in particular
More discussion  on the practical value of CT concepts

##  Commentary / Discussion on Learning Dimensions

More discussion  on the practical value of CT concepts

### CT as a practical skill or a more abstract concept.

A general discussion of varied views and my own based on data of this study.

### It's fun but are they learning
Exploring the tactic of reflective practices to back up CTs being found in the wild. Both for practitioner and participants as per [@petrich_it_2013].


### Discussion on UMC and PRIMM in relation to use of 3M model (Practitioner focus)

- UMC - should also be covered in the Remix part of the design ?

<!-- not sure how much to put in about this in LIT REVIEW  -->
Note on PRIMM and personal knowledge.

Recap on PRIMM ? - THIS WILL BE IN LIT REVIEW MOST PROBABLY

Da and Te - In these interaction the parent seems keen for the child to be able to express and demonstrate their personal knowledge of coding, games and maths concepts.

This is an interaction which in some ways is comparable to the PRIMM model which is suggested for classroom use. However to do it in the way demonstrated by this pair would involve a level of coding familiarity, and ongoing familiarity with the structure and thinking of the participant which would be difficult to achieve in many classrooms.

UMC on the other hand while being less described and open to interpretation seems to match the more informal, iterative game making of many participants.

### Different strokes

A different strokes commentary. Depending on aims of the practitioner and context of the game making different tactics may be applicable.
