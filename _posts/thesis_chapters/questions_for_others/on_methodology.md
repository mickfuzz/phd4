Quick Summary of this Email: I am looking for examples of papers or thesis chapter which present results in line with design-based research and apply activity theory concepts.     


Hello,

I've been on the list for a while but I'd really like to start to use it to check my understandings for future publications (hopefully in a useful way). If this is not a good topic for this list please feel free to direct me to alternatives. I'm unable to attend ISCAR 2024, but similar events are welcome.

My PhD thesis is on on home educated families making code-based digital games together facilitated by myself and student helpers over 6-8 week course iterations. Although this wasn't my intention, there's lots of cross over the Fifth Dimension project.

The process is iterative and responsive in line with design based approaches. In a recent supervision review of a chapter which outlines the evolution of the learning design, my main supervisor is questioning to why, if my thesis is driven by a design-based research approach, are my chapters or findings not structured by the chronological phases. I can see their point, a chronological approach may be easier to follow.

Instead, in this first chapter of findings, I am outlining activity happening at different scopes and then in subsequent sections I explore significant conflicts / contractions in activity and the resulting design. I've found some work that presents findings in a similar way (Barab et al., 2002): there is an interesting section in that work.

"Although the boundaries we chose to frame an action (or a series of actions) are at a smaller scale than those typically used to delineate larger “activity systems” (see Engeström, 1987, 1993, 1999), it is our contention that using Engeström’s (1987) triangle to explain instances of activity at this scale is useful, meaningful, and, we argue, theoretically consistent with activity theory (Engeström, personal e-mail communication, January 3, 2001)."

I am also taking this path, analysing activity on a smaller scale. To help guide and justify my approach, I wanted to find similar work. Specifically, I wanted to ask if anyone has pointers for how to structure the evolution of a learning design (design experiment) in a PhD thesis (or similar). In addition, links to any examples would be very welcome.

Examining activity on a smaller scale seems appropriate to my proposal that the use of of game design patterns is a helpful intermediate HCI / design concept for novices in a new community of game makers. But that's another chapter!

For completeness, I'm linking to a rough draft of the chapter here.
