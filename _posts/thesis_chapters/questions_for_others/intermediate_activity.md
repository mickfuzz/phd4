Hello,

Hello,

I've been on the list for a while but I'd really like to start to use it to check my understandings for future publications (hopefully in a useful way). If this is not a good topic for this list please feel free to direct me to alternatives. I'm unable to attend ISCAR 2024, but similar events are welcome.

My PhD thesis is on on home educated families making code-based digital games together facilitated by myself and student helpers over 6-8 week course iterations. Although this wasn't my intention, there's lots of cross over the Fifth Dimension project.

The process is iterative and responsive in line with design based approaches. However in presenting my finding I am drawing on Rogoff's 3 planes (personal, social and cultural) approach to interpret and present findings.

In addition, I am using analysis of tensions and conflicts between activity systems elements and the e explain the and to analyse the development of learner agency in the design, following the idea of TADS (transformative agency through double stimulation).

I have a couple of areas that I'm struggling to represent.
