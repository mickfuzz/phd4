# Methodology

## Introduction

This chapter builds on the theoretical concepts explored in the previous chapter to explain how they are put into practice using a specific methodology to study the evolution of a game making community and the mutual creation of a new community-based pedagogy. The methodology of the data collection and analysis process is informed by cultural historical approaches.

The importance of context and cultural factors are particularly relevant for this intervention in a non-formal educational context with diverse stakeholder.


<!-- As previously explored, the research questions invite a broad spectrum of analysis - cultural and social factors. -->
<!-- The depth justifies smaller data size and depth of analysis. -->

Driven by my dual role as a researcher and learning facilitator the process described here encorporates both research methodology and an overall structure of the evolving learning design. Thic

In terms of a reaseach process, this chapter describes a hybrid approach which while based on the principles of a formative intervention but incorporating other approaches where relevant. I justify this approach in the following sections.

Turning the learning design encountered by participants, I have worked with young learners, local families and undergraduate student helpers to co-create a game making design via iterative phases of rapidly evolving interventions most closely resembling a DBR process.


<!-- If found the work of Rogoff in particular to research community oriented processes particularly illuminating -->


Here I cover the use of video recordings, participant interviews, and analysis of observational journal entries and resulting learning resources to achieve the systemic analysis previously outlined as typical of activity theory and CHAT-aligned design based reasearch (DBR).



#### Outline of chapter

INTERATE WITH ABOVE?

I will explore how this diversity helps triangulate findings.

this chapter describes:

- an overview of the design stages of the study
- data gathering and processing
- data analysis explored in stages
- comments on data validity, replicability and ethical considerations
- analysis of broad AT system (MOVE?)




## Summary of phases and resources of the study

The following sective provides an overview of activity use by phase briefly detailing the evolution of tools and processes. A following section outines the data gathering processes used at each stage before turn to the process of data analyis. Finding in other chapters, in particular the design narrative of Chapter 5, explore the rationale for the selection, creation and adaptation of both existing and novel tools and processes in each stage in line with the driving research questions. Fuller techincal descriptions of the tools and supporting resources used at each stage are beyond the scope of those questions and the limits of the structure of this thesis, fuller technical descriptions to and links to the online resources created are available as appendix 4.x.  A summary of the delivery phases and one key development period are outlined in a graphical representation below in Fig 4.x.

Before exploring the phases in more detail, an overview of the process of participant into into the learning design follows.

#### Overview of importance of participant input to learning design

EDIT DOWN?

The value of participant input to intervention-based research in the domain of technology use is well explored via participatory research  [@iversen_computational_2018-1; @iivari_critical_2017], design-based approaches [@papavlasopoulou_exploring_2019; @barab_design-based_2004] and formative interventions [@cole_fifth_2006; @blunden_formative_2023]. In line with these research perspectives, the development of the tools and processes used by participants in this study emerged in response to my analysis of participant experience and their direct feedback.

This process is evident in the evolution of the learning design and resources. For example, the trialling of the coding environment and starting templated occurred over the course of two years and with input and concrete additions from parent volunteers, graduate trainee-teacher students, undergraduate students helpers University colleagues and with more indirect ongoing feedback from participating young people and their guardians. Input took varied forms. Direct input was through help requests made by participants and feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.


My role as a facilitator included recognising and supporting the emergence of a repertoire of varied emergent practices in the responses of participants, and then to support these practices with suitable tools and resources. In this way, I support participants to build agency in their transformation of learning process. The following three chapters of research findings in part describe these transformations and emerging repetoires in more detail.

<!-- IF I WERE TO WRITE MORE WHERE WOULD IT BE AND WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE - WHERE ARE THOSE DESCRIPTIONS HAPPENING? IN THE FINDINGS CHAPTER ? -->

#### D1: Initial research and development - August and September 2017

From PhD proposal games for a read write world.

* Phaser
* Thimble

Before engaging with families in P1 in August 2017 I followed tutorials on Mozilla's developer community website on writing games in javascript. I had used Mozilla's Thimble code playground tool in earlier work teaching javascript, a snapshot of which is available as PGCE dissertation [@chesterman_webmaking_2015]. I discovered I could use  Thimble, to house a working javascript based game. Mozilla promoted a professional, open source, javascript library for web game making called Phaser.js. At this time I also evaluated several online pixel graphics editors and chose Piskelapp.com.

#### P1: A phase of exploratory, co-creative game making - October 2017 to March 2018  

<!-- NOTE - The evolution involves phases and then tension - what and how to cover both?  -->
<!-- This phase took place before the official start of this research and relevant ethics application. As such,  -->


**Participants started with no set plan or toolset and were asked to plan and make a game in two larger groups of 5-6 participants of mixed ages. After several weeks, a minimal incomplete starting game code template was introduced in response to student need.**


Phase one was an extended, exploratory series of game making sessions over several months. This stage was aimed not at collecting user data rather than building my  competency as a facilitator. The process began with no pre-existing supporting materials. Several weeks in to the processes, I adapted a starting code template of a platform game and created various code examples to add functionality requested by participants. This template was adapted from an online tutorial to create a game of the _platformer_ genre  (see glossary), a move which helped to limit expectations of the technical complexity of their game. At the end of this stage participants showcased their games to students in the foyer of the MMU Brooks building.


**Tools used:** Phaser javascript library; Thimble code playground; online graphics editor Piskel; a varied set of other graphical and audio asset creation tools.


#### D2: Development Stage - May 2018 to December 2018

One-off workshops at Mozilla, Feral Vector and Manchester libraries events and to PGCE computer students helped focus and the creation of a “half baked” game template and supporting online and printable resources.

<!-- The requirements of this compressed time frame aligned with feedback to prompt me to design an accelerated process to bump start the game-production process. -->

<!-- The first phase of delivery in late 2018 was based on initial research stage; I drew on literature to identify factors to consider when designing for collaboration, adopting a project based approach inspired by design thinking.  -->
<!-- To inculcate parents and children in to the culture of retro video games I began initial sessions by inviting participants to older arcade games on laptops. -->
<!-- Game filled laptops.  
Should this be added to the table above
-->
<!-- The tools allow participants to create games using a combination of a free to use online tools.
an online  coding environment
using the phaser javascript game library (glitch.com), a pixel art editor (piskelapp.com), and a sound effect generator (sfbgames.com/chiptone). -->

<!-- #### The half-baked starting platformer game
Participants started with no set plan or toolset and were asked to plan and make a game in two larger groups of 5-6 participants of mixed ages. After several weeks, a minimal incomplete starting game code template was introduced in response to student need.

NOTE - ALSO EXPLORED IN NEXT CHAPTER - HOW TO ARRANGE?

The use and design characteristics of the starting point of a half-baked game.

- Phaser 2 to avoid complexity of code structure
- 2D platformer - familiar to most - Mario and Sonic
- low-spec graphics
- game of player, platforms, and coins to collect and hazards to avoid.
- graphical level design
- key variables brought to the top
- simple structure of code in terms of aligning with framework and not adding extra functions


**Variable editing effective movement**

Player movement was a key to playtesting feedback as such three  key variables were highlighted at the very start of the game code and given descriptive names to facilitate their editing. When testing the game, the player's jump height was not great enough to allow progression up from the floor to one of the platform thus thwarting the collection of items.

Game progression require altering at least one of the descriptively names variables associated with jump height and then activating a preview window to observer the changes by playing the game in a new browser tab.
<!--FIND  Some evidence of building proficiency with significant work to change these three   

    // Variables that change how the player moves
    var gravity = 500;
    var velocity_x = 100;
    var velocity_y = 300;

While some participants engaged with extensive experimentation to find a player movement feel that seemed just right, others were much less concerted with this aspect of game play, lowering gravity drastically to allow a greater jump size but a more frustrating floaty jump.

**Level design and prototyping**

The starting**Glitch Game Club**
First iteration of game making course of 5-6 weeks. The template and resources created in the previous stage were used as a starting point but continued to evolve.
**Tools:**
 Phaser; Glitch, Piskel; updated game template; quick start cards; step-by-step tutorials; code examples   game template included a minimal amount of platforms, hazards to avoid and golden blocks to collect. Image 4.x above show a printable _quick start_ cards to aid participants to begin the process of changing level design.

As preThe possibility of disturbing the syntax of the  of code in the array. When participant did this it provided a good opportunity for facilitators or parents to outline the importance of correct syntax of and to explain the code structure.

The vignette in the last chapter saw Toby's adding new levels to his  game and undertaking many iterations of changes to the level design. He and several other participants spent extensive time performing level design activity with a goal of making the game extremely challenging but still technically possible. Others played with the convention of the game by removing all hazards and filling the screen with rewards/coins (an example is outlined in the starting vignette of the next chapter).

**Incomplete graphical blocks & Piskel**

The use of blank, coloured blocks of 32 x 32 pixels encouraged participants to change the graphical design and the relatively small size of the sprites encouraged rapid design.

PERHAPS REPLACE THIS WITH SCREEN SHOT OF PISKEL AS A TOOL
![](./Pictures/whale_1.png){width=50%}

The process of creating a pixel art characters and hazard involved using an online grid design tool called Piskel, creating an design of an appropriate size, saving, exporting as an image, downloading to the hard drive of the laptop in use and finally uploading and incorporating the image into the code project and linking using   code syntax.

#### P2: Accelerated game making programme  - 5 weeks in January to February 2019

**Glitch Game Club**
First iteration of game making course of 5-6 weeks. The template and resources created in the previous stage were used as a starting point but continued to evolve.


**Tools used:** Phaser; Glitch code playground replaces Thimble, Piskel; a starter game template; quick start cards; step-by-step tutorials; code snippet examples.

NOT TRUE SEE LINK IN NOTES
By the beginning of P2 most of the resources and activities were in place and relatively stable. There were some incremental evolutions in the template that stemmed from participant feedback and my reflections. Key additions at this stage to support the use of a template were a collection of tutorials and code examples illustrating key game features that had been requested by participants. The collection of game patterns were presented in a web page together with the starting template and a link to an online book collecting the process into step-by-step chapter based tutorials. The resources are explored in more depth in sections three and four below. A more complete description of the resources used in P2 and P3 are included in appendix 4.x.The experimental team consisted of Home Educating families . Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly.

Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.

#### P3: Adding a process drama to the game making programme: 5 weeks in May 2019


P3 used the same toolset as P2 however in addition, drew on my previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department [@caldwell_drama_2019] to create a simple drama process to give an external motivation and narrative to the creation of games using for a fictional audience of visiting aliens. The participant activity of these stages and tensions between system elements are discussed in detail in the remainder of this chapter and in following chapters.

**Tools used:** As per P2; a drama scenario; side missions; a code project to interact with aliens using markdown code.   

#### P4: Adapting resources to MakeCode Arcade and more formal settings - November 2019 to September 2020

The last iterations of the learning design adopted the MakeCode Arcade tool as a new game authoring tool. This block based programming environment reduced participant coding errors allowing a greater focus on game making concepts.

In 2019 MakeCode Arcade was launched to make games using for novice coders via the use of a block coding systems similar to Scratch. I adapted resources with an aim that they could be used within secondary classrooms to support computing curriculum. To do this I added a learning dimensions map, a process which is explored in a later section of this chapter. I ran two iterations of game making course using MakeCode Arcade. The facilitation techniques and approach were adapted from those of P2 to facilitate the use of the block coding language [^1]. Tool use at this stage is also explored in a chapter in a collection on K-12 computing education [@chesterman_game_2023].

I also adapted and advanced resources with an aim that they could be used within secondary classrooms to support computing curriculum. To do this I added a learning dimensions map, a process which is explored in chapter.

**Tools used:** Make Code Arcade (MCA) tool; MCA Template starting game; MCA quick start cards; MCA game pattern menu; MCA game pattern tutorials ; Learning Dimensions Map.  

Include footnote to online resources.

<!-- At this stage of writing I include a bullet point list of design relevant features to be expanded later.

- Shared repositories of resources - users shared a log in so they could see the work created by others.
- Showcase: At the end of the game making process students asked strangers to play their game in the foyer of my departmental building
- Drama Games: the process of warming up, creates community and sets a tone
- Drama Process: specifically designed ot  overcome limits of the classroom.
- Playtesting: the process of playtesting, either self or peer links back to a community purpose

### Challenges of data collection and processing

While the rich set of data invites the cross referencing of the many sources, it also presents challenge on how to deal effectively with the large amounts of data being gathered. The use of a 360 camera reduces the amount of live video footage of interactions needed. Instead of multiple cameras pointed in different directions to capture participant interaction, participants are arranged in a square pointing inwards towards a central 360 degree camera.

<!-- I use a software sustainability approach also influenced by a personal modification of permaculture computing ideas and ideas of free software and open document approaches. The very nature of working with video is time consuming. -->
<!-- There is sometimes a danger of imagining how a new data gathering tool could be useful but then not being aware of all of the potential pitfalls which can make processing the data time consuming. Also  -->
<!-- On a personal note, I sometimes like the challenges involved and sometimes find them infuriating. It can be like a specialist knowledge which you can use as a currency, or as a hidden knowledge that you take pride in sharing. -->

<!-- I use a software sustainability approach also influenced by a personal modification of permaculture computing ideas and ideas of free software and open document approaches.

- Data portability and interoperability
- Software sustainability, in particular longevity
- Licencing - FLOSS licence ?
- If proprietary - then what is the business model?
- Is batch processing of files possible?
- It it a cross platform approach - in particular can I use it on debian based linux systems?

I also take a more practical approach which takes into account working with peers and that such advocacy is not a core part of my job or this research.

Such an attitude may involve compromises or hacking systems, software or processes -->

#### 360 Video Processing

The processing of video and audio data of both captured screens and 360 video data and high quality audio data involved several stages yielding advantages in capturing the gestures and facial expressions of potentially all participants in one recording. It does however present challenges. While this merits further exploration a brief summary of challenges is presented here.

The process involves large video files that are easily corrupted in transfer. While the files are split into 8 minute segments  but also can be confusing
- time navigation - also confusing - sometimes put up on the screen - but inconsistently
- moving and keeping a track of data from week to week and over years is complex.
- processing data requires special software - from samsung
- viewing data on a normal vlc player - needs extra processing using spatial media

<!-- Tech details are logged here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6m20wehYkTeevj9QucpzKCR4NioELndg2rZeLWFK-c/edit# -->


This whole process is so demanding in terms of careful file management. Making me create a linux command line toolbox which is included as a technical appendix. [A draft of which is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7MsZDY8ofvls5XO7tztSu8KFdClJo09o3qpWOdkb2M/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=11432580350275268987)


#### Screen Capture Processing

I chose the software flashback pro primarily as it was intalled on and availble at low cost on home computers. Flashback saves data in a format. This include audio, video screen capture, learner keystrokes, mouse movements and optionally one or more webcams. I decided not to record on webcams for the following reasons:

- intrusive feel - having the webcam on and the resulting red light on the screen, I felt was less conducive to feeling comfortable than one 360 camera in the middle of the room.
- less resources - recording webcam on the laptop
- reduced video file size of final data file
- less complexity when processing data -

It not possible to code the natively created files directly. Thus need to be converted to mp4 to import into coding software like Nvivo. In this process the keyboard and mouse data is lost.

<!-- Thus original files have been retained in order to cross reference that data if it is useful. It also presents other options for analysis which are similar to much more in depth analysis of HCI research of professional set ups. While this is beyond the remit of this study, certain uses do present themselves strongly for future investigation. Particularly the study of such data to identify common mistakes or frustrations when interacting with the user interface. Such misconceptions could be addressed in direct teaching at the start of the next session. -->



#### Learnings and recommendations on processing - MERGE UP

The following learning and recommendations emerged from this process.

Prioritise displaying time - have an old school clock under the 360 camera. For example.

Check viability of data at each stage of processing and movement.


## Data Analysis

My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer, participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. I also record the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants.

One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour.

### Notes to allocate to a stage



#### Rational and approach of data analysis -


Video data analysis involved description and transcription of video data and thematic analysis of the contents.

Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.

<!-- The gathering of data and revision of teaching materials took place over several years. As such, there was time for extensive reflection and reconsideration of factors involved in the learning design in dialogue with existing literature on game making and game making communities. -->



Analysis was in different forms, and drew on additional forms of data gathering.

- Broad dipping into sessions via 360 video, advantages, focusing on community interactions, disadvantages of
- Transcription and annoation of video capture footage in parallel with 360 data
- Coding of sections of video to both emergent themes and themes relating to the reseearch questions.

NOTE - Import more from the post of 2024- 05 - 08 - in diary.


### S1 (stage one) data analysis

#### Practitioner  interviews

Practitioner data used in stage one to inform strategies and pedagogies for the initial design.

Four practitioner interviews were a rich source of thinking to help develop and deepen my reflection on key issues, to develop lines of thinking and to expose and explore barriers to participation in projects, tactics to address them and tensions experienced by practitioners and participants in similar creative coding projects.

The interviews were semi-structured allowing me to ask follow up questions to gain more detail on areas of interest.  

The chosen interviewees represented a certain diversity in audience however as these interview are limited in number, resulting data are also explore in relation to existing research and no broad claims are made from this data alone.

These interviews are not explored greatly in the course of the analysis thesis as the key emergent themes were not explored in depth by those participants as while they were working in similar areas, they did not address game making explicitly. However, the interview process did has impacted in the overall direction of the work in by surfacing and focusing my attention on some key themes including: the helping roles of parents in digital technology; the role of competitions in after-schools settings, the value of surfacing and valuing the interests of partipants in digital making, and x.

A summary of the interviews is included as Appendix 4.x

#### S1 Video analysis

As outline in the table above, stage one involved initial broad analysis of the varied forms of data and recording observations in an excel sheet.

This data was analysed, at a broad scale,  using 3 planes of sociocultural activity. The existing relevant framework saves time, especially as a more emergent approach was  (in part ) in coding video data.

WHY NOT GROUNDED? OR TO WHAT EXTENT WAS IT GROUNDED? IN THE AREA OF INTERPERSONAL ACTIVITY.


#### 3 planes approach - noting tensions and behaviours

RQx addresses the formation of a game-making community. This process is co-constituted by planners, facilitators, parents and children.

Following the approach of Morcom [@morcom_scaffolding_2014] I drew on Rogoff's  [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of sociocultural activity used to help understand activity in a Community of Learners.

I created an excel spreadsheet and noted behaviour and tentions that emerged in transcription and coding.

This helped to get closer to the data and to :

  - start identify to  thematic analysis of the stages of design with other learning models like PBL
- to identify roles through repeated patterns of interactions, and contrast to Barron's work
- to reflect on the thesis questions


While the three planes provided a higher level framework, specifics of the data gave greater granularity and formed sub categories of coding used in the next stage of analysis.


<!-- Rather than taking a grounded approach this data was analysed using 3 planes of sociocultural activity. The existing relevant framework saves time, especially as a more emergent approach was  (in part ) in coding video data. -->

<!-- The process aligns with AT analysis in the scope of the activity - and in the separation out of the community level of the triangle added by Engestrom . -->




 - The advantages of drawing on funds of knowledge, and the activities that I used to do this, as well as connecting to wider communities are address well with the plane of culture, in the concept of Apprenticeship.


<!-- While more complex, the plane of more individual participatory appropriation, allows for alignment and then transfer to more formal learning environments. This then makes this research more relevant to class room and guided sessions. -->





#### Use of journal data

My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music.

<!-- To be able to effectively analyse these diverse sources, I will need to prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes. I explore some of the emerging themes and criteria for selection which incidents to explore in depth in the results section below. -->

The process of analysis of journal notes and resulting resources required a different approach from that of video data.

The following resources were examined

- Book Journal pages
- Digital journal entries directly in response to teaching sessions


<!-- - Linear support book and print outs to support participants in sessions
- Additional 3M model resources to help navigation and reflection and gameful approaches -->

Journal Notes were used in the following ways: (perhaps code this)

- as a reflective tool after sessions
- as a note pad to plan resource creation
- as a sketch pad to explore the relationship between Concepts being explored and existing game making frameworks
- as a

The quantity of data prevented extensive and detailed coding using thematic analysis.

Instead, observations are triangulated with data from lit review to expose key themes and tensions.

My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use and other relevant interests.


<!-- AT allows an exploration these diverse sources of information as mediating artefacts which are the enabler and product of the shifting goals and outcomes of the programmes participants. -->

<!-- A key strategy of AT used to locate learning happening in an environment, is via the identification of contradictions between different elements of the activity systems and subsequent study of how these contradictions are resolved (Engeström and Sannino, 2010). I plan to use my journal and participant interviews to identify key moments of contradictions and resolution to study in greater detail using the range of data available. I am also inspired by the work of Oliver and Pelletier (2006)who employed contradictions between systemic elements to create a coding scheme used to interpret video data in a study on game based learning. -->



### S2 (stage two) data analysis

Schema for initial thematic analysis in stage two  was informed by literature review, early analysis of journal entries and  emerging observations of data in stage one


#### Video analysis - Transcription/description of data

The partial transcription of video data formed a significant part of the data analysis. The large amount of video data recorded forced a prioritisation of data to be transcribed. It also forced a partial transcription process which was in part descriptive and in other parts involved a closer transcription of the words spoken by participants.

To aid the process of coding, I broke up analysis of  in 5 minute sections.

This limited the accuracy of the process. In part, this element of the research was limited by the practicalities of working with this amount of data.

I priorised more data as this was needed to get a greater scope of activity to allow analysis of wider community activity.


**Justification of selecting sessions and sections for more detailed analysis**

Then deciding on 8-10 video sessions warranting full coding of activity.
This was based on the following factors, quality of recording, how much activity, richness of interactions, a range of diffent kinds of participant interactions.


Criteria  for inclusion included both practical and theoretical considerations.

- Good quality recording
- Diversity of kinds of participants, ages especially
- Diversity of participant actions in terms of tasks being worked on
- Diversity of kinds of pair and peer interactions


A page of quick analysis of the files online here helped to shape that decision on what sections
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpAIqHPg_Z0S5MWeS0rBTvxCL1N9NQButam4Ozq39Ek/edit#


##### Selection of vignettes for deeper analysis

- Full transcription of key moments: and description of participant activity, activity on screen including simple gesture analysis

Used in chapters to orient the reader


**Incorporating  movement around the room in analysis**

The 360 camera allowed for side by side analyis of the group, pair or individual working. Due to the layout these were cluster often around a laptop.

In the initial stages of transcription and description having this data was extremely useful to disambiguate spoken statements.

As a personal experience of describing and transcribing even thought it was a significant amount of work to synchronise and then to play both video sources side by side, the additional information really aided the description process in adding detail to the interpretations of motivations of participants.  

For an example see the vignette in appendix 6.x (Suzanna and Olivia) chapter 6 which details the movement and behaviours of the child away from the computer as an example of legitimate peripheral activity.



**Simple gesture analysis**

In some exchanges, 360 data was vital to explain spoken word.

This helped clarify some things that were unclear from audio and screen capture data.


For example, deictic referencing, where unclear statements were clafied with pointing or other gestures was common. Such gesture were used often  to clarify game movements on screen, or in one case a software procedure of cropping an image.

#### Video analysis - first pass of thematic analysis / coding

Thematic analysis is commonly done in stages, each revision building on insights of the previous one.

While sstage one surfaced themes, stage two created a coding structure in nvido

Video coded in segments in word -
In this level, the rough coding involved by breaking up video timescales into 5 minute sections lessens the ability to make exact claims however for this study it opens up lines of initial questioning which can be explored in future studies or triangulated with other data in this study.


Describing different grades and pass overs of the video data.

- quick analysis
- sections coded and described in 5 minute chunks
- themes of interest identified - in relation to evolving RQs  -  to create evolving drafts of the emerging themes
- some sections transcribed in more details based in themes, more detail on gesture analysis also added

The following themes  emerged as potential learning outcomes in the learning model, and were observed in interactions in stage one

- Elements of Computational Thinking
- Systems Thinking Concepts
- Design cycle stages
- Types of Gameplay Design Patterns (MDA)
- participant roles and interactions

CT   was not included at stage 2 as there is other extensive or focused work in these fields (previously explored in the literature review) on CT which this study which this study does not need to replicate.

Systems thinking was promising but not a proposed part of the learning design, and the data in P2 and P3 which became a chief focus of thus study was not as rich in this area as later P4 data.

##### Coding Participant Roles and Interactions.

Evolving notes on coding of roles and interactions are in an online document here.

Excel doc -    https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit

Roles are different from interactions existing on a higher order of anaysis. Repeated patterns of interactions can be seen to develop into roles. Thus a more grounded approach may concentrate initially on interactions and develop this to become roles through analysis. However, many roles exist in other similar domains.

For example, the work of my own staring point when coding was guided by Barron and colleagues work on the roles of parents as learning partners [-@barron_parents_2009]. The roles are as follows: Teacher, Collaborator, Learning Broker, Resource Provider, Nontechnical Consultant, Employer, and Learner.

when coding I started with some preset codes from the literature for examples Barron's codes on parent roles when helping digital projects. However, as coding progressed, I modified and extended these codes to better match the data I was working with

Specifically, the following were removed from Barron's typology, parent as employer, non-technical consultant. Learning broker and resource provider were merged as some of the detail of those roles involve take place outside of the learning environment being analysed in coded video.

 I judged it appropriate to and less complex to analyse and code the interaction between participants rather than code the behaviours by participant type.



#### Analysis of the evolution of the programme resources created - THIS ISN'T REALLY A SECTION?

WHERE ELSE COULD IT GO IF NEEDED.

There were two main types of resources created.

- supporting teaching / facilitation RESOURCES
- games and game and assets created

The documentation and other forms of support evolved during each phase -

I did not try to collect any personal notes that participants used for planning. And this was minimal for many participants.

Chapter four explores the evolution of these resources using AT as a tool for analysis of the existing and emerging contradictions in activity.


### S3 (stage three) data analysis




<!-- Source article

#### Original plan for Stage 3

THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR STAGE 3 - In the final stage, previous transcripts with notes were  imported data into nvivo and coded each of the 5 minute sections to the final thematic analysis.

After drafts of the emerging themes were in place, these were sued to create a revised coding structure and data was recoded more systematically. .

#### Revisiting the research questions based on the evolution of the learning design. - REALLY EDIT DOWN

<!-- SEE IF THIS FITS BETTER AT THE END OF CH.3.
BUT WRITE FOR HERE FOR NOW -->

Bakker offers guidance in the formulation of research questions in DBR studies which are relevant to this thesis [@bakker_design_2018]. He promotes HOW and WHAT CONSIDERATIONS formulation of question to be represent the exploratory nature of DBR approaches and to increase the possibility of possible generalisation without over promising in terms of projecting beyond the embedded nature of the findings as embedded in the context of the study.

Because the process of both formative intervention and DBR is exploratory with no set starting hypothesis, the process of formulation of RQs necessary one which is revisited as the process unfolds. This section considers some of those revisions as a way to futher explore detail of that evolutionary process.

##### RQ2 - Shift from family impact to broader quetions

A key driver of my research was to explore the potential to draw on family experience in learning activities by working with families to make games together. As the study evolved, the family dimension of interaction was only one of several which emerged as significant. However, it would be challenging to separate out the family elements from others as the social resource created by families working together proved to be significant. Thus additional behaviours between young people and supporting behaviours from student helpers may have evolved in a sense benefiting from this base platform. Thus it makes sense to widen the scope of one of the research questions beyond impact of family involvement on a game making process to instead to focus on a diverse and complex picture of the development of agency as a community, as outlined in RQ2.  

2. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?

<!-- BE SPECIFIC? -->
The remaining research questions guiding this study are broadly aimed  at developing greater understanding existing and developing new the supporting mechanics of game making as a educational process, with a particular focus on the development of  agency within a CHAT perspective.

1.  What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to game coding and design?
3. How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?


Because it suited my working practices as an educational facilitator, and in line with DBR approaches the initial design evolved from phase to phase and relied heavily on input from participants and a wider, online, open source digital production-education community [] Mozilla link / Sefton Green.

The hybrid of DBR and formative methodology was chosen for its iterative, collaborative approach, which aligns with the study’s ethos of a detailed and systemic exploration of the expansion of the object of the game making pedagogy in an authentic and complex context.


### S3 thematic analysis - not via coding but via examples

JUSTIFY NOT USING NVIVO - AND DOING AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY BASED ON THE WIDER REQUIREMENTS OF THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS THAT ARE COVERING NEW GROUND RATHER THAN DRILLING DOWN O EXISTING AREAS OF PRACTICE.

As the research is so open in scope and even the general themes were not precise in the early coding stages, this justifies decision to x y.

Thus categories of new uses of GDP and patterns of agency development in this domain were identified in the following way.
And then described in the following ways.

This brings us to the topic of strengths and limitations of the research approach.

#### The theme of use of GDPs

I'm not sure how to introduce this.

- in personal appropriation of concepts
- assisting project navigation
- scaffolding ideation processes
- aiding division of labour
- GDPs in technical processes
- facilitating designing for others
- GDPs used as concepts in playtesting
- playtesting used to propagate GDPs
- facilitating use of home knowledge via GDPS

#### A revised processes of thematic analysis

What was really needed - Prioritising the selection of data and quick reading of it in nvivo

Complexities - thus rejecting comparative approach.


After data analysis in stage one. The following revisions were made in overall schema of coding.

While useful, I dropping design stages as a schema, for justification and implications see discussion in chapter six.



The wider helping interactions, again while useful had drawbacks. Firsly, they were so numerous. Secondly, given the existing work of a general scope of digital making by Barron, it was not clear what I would add in terms of contribution to knowledge beyond broadly confirming it in the scope of digital game making.

Instead, an area that was more targetted emerged from these areas.

 <!-- The analysis of these resources using the three planes involved a choice of some of the following
- using a spread sheet and putting categories and notes in to columns
- using a table in word to record notes on data in-situ -->

<!-- The video data explored in nvivo is very time consuming, and given this and the factor that the transforming reflections into  learning resources, already involves a process of filtering, a much courser level of data analysis. -->

<!-- However, using a static text only approach such as describing data in prose or using a table in a word document does not allow for filtering based on themes which is potentially useful as an analytical too.   -->

##### Coding use of GDPs as mediational strategies
This is explored in chapter 5

##### Coding impact on design/ processes on learner agency - boiled down -

<!-- NOTE  I would say no - too complex for coding  -->

- authenticity of tool use, especially docs and access to Community
- authenticity of audience - and role of drama to facilitate reflection

## Ethical considerations and processes

Ethical approval for this study was obtained from ESRI ethics process using the ETHOS system to ensure that all research activities comply with the guidelines for research involving human participants. Inclusion criteria included being part of a family (including guardians) unit with the ability to travel to the Manchester Metropolitan university campus campus. Younger family members will be between 7 and 13 years of age. All participants will have an interest in learning to make digital games together as an educational project. The project requires that they have literacy abilities to be able to read and write English.

Participants were be identified by involvement in activities linked to Manchester Met's EdLab programme and that of Coder Dojo activities via an open call on email to interested parties. In addition to address a wider diversity of participants in terms of  to Alternative arrangements may involve an open call to the Greater Manchester Home Education Network internet forum. In the ethics application I noted that participants may be excluded from studies if there is a over-representation of one gender or ethnicity over another. In practice all applicants were accommodated as the gender and ethnicity balance was broadly representative of the home education groups in the local area.

Given the involvement of three different participant groups of university students, parents, and children, I adapted assent forms, participant information sheets and processes to requirements of each group. For parents, a detailed assent form explained the study’s purpose, how data from children would be collected and managed, and the rights of parents, including their ability to withdraw themselves and their child at any time. For children, a simplified assent form was created using age-appropriate language. This form explained the study in simple terms, emphasising that participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw at any time without negative consequences. Written assent from the children was obtained as part of an informal discussion involving both children and parents. University students were also provided with a assent form explaining the study’s purpose, their rights (including voluntary participation and the right to withdraw without consequence), and data usage. They were given the opportunity to review the form and ask questions before providing written consent.

To ensure respect for the autonomy of all participants, particularly children, alternative activities were offered as part of the recruitment process for those who did not wish to participate in the study. This was important in settings where families may have felt a pressure to take part in research in order to benefit from the social or educational opportunities.  

It was not possible to anonymise video, audio recordings at the point of collection, however is has been anonymised in the process of data analysis through the use of pseudonyms.  The raw video data and additional data from the project has been stored on a password protected external computer drive, separate from the research data. Only the lead researcher had direct access although the ethics approval process gave project supervisors may be given access on request. I took care to not allow any personal data into the public realm as part of the research on analysis process.

As the study involved children additional safeguards were in place. All university students assisting with the study, as well as myself as the primary facilitator, had undergone Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks as part of the EdLab studies programme. Activities involving children were conducted under the supervision of a parent or guardian, who could withdraw the child from the study at any time. Children were reminded, in terms they could understand, that they could opt out at any time.

## Data validity, reliability and generalisability  

<!-- **and decisions of what to not analyse** -->

The issues addressed in this section relate not only to the guidance methodology receives from the theoretical underpinnings explored in the last chapter but also the concerns of the driving researcher questions.

Issues of reliability and validity in research are significantly complicated when viewed through a post-objectivist critical stance, as exemplified in the previous chapter by Stetsenko's transformative activist stance, which challenges positivist paradigms of research as a neutral endeavour in terms of values of those undertaking it [@stetsenko2014transfromative]. While, a full investigation of the Stetsenko and other's rejection of an objectivist research approach is beyond the remit of this chapter, it supports the inclusion of my own auto-ethnographic journal as a valid source of data.

### Data Validity

In general terms data validity refers to match between the findings of the study and what is happening in in practice.  Turning to a more established exploration of data validity,  Bakker's [-@bakker_design_2018, p.88] exploration of the issues of data validity in DBR is well suited to the diverse data gathering methods of this study.

<!-- While Bakker notes need for different approaches for qualitative approaches  [@lincoln1985naturalistic] - he uses conventional terms of validity and reliability -= rather than specialist terms of Lincoln and Grub  -->


The strategies in this study are broadly, data triangulation, the use of rich descriptions, and a process of checking your interpretations of activities with participants (member checking)


**Use of rich descriptions**

Hoadley calls for rich descriptions of the learning design, a process which is applied in this thesis as a design narrative in Chapter 5.

Similarly, rich descriptions of the interactions of participants with the learning design, their own project creations and each other are included in the data results in small extracts, or where appropriate more extended vignettes. These allow for a fuller exploration of the learning processes in a richer context. Some details of interaction are needed to give other scholars and practitioners a full picture of interactions. The descriptions of facial reactions or body language in the vignette descriptions serve this end.


**Data triangulation**
<!-- Draw on other chapters to represent overcoming of weaknesses of design-based approach. -->

Having a wide based on data allowed data triangulation at the analysis stage. When

One form of triangulation is member checking where participants are asked to confirm and share information which supplement video data.

As an example, in interview data a participant who expressed frustration in the moment about a form of disruptive practice of another participant, was able to place that frustration in context.

#### Limits of / problems with video data analysis

The choice of the videos to code more fully is rather skewed towards finding interesting data. Thus it may not be fully representative of the experience of all participants.

Choosing in a different way - around less interaction - would expose more barriers to participation to game making using the 3M model.
<!-- For example in
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQf0OvKs07tY-VKDnB7K94F_kHVW7M1Vz0NlLm1t1WE/edit
Imagining a constructionist game-based pedagogical model: Using tabletop role-playing game creation to enhance literature education in high school English classes -->

Only suitable pairs were chosen. This removes a lot of validity from any generalisation of claims that could be made.

Breaking of data into 5 min sections is practical but does not allow for some of the finer interactions and changes of behaviour to be accurately coded.  There may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granular detail.

<!-- The game elements / design patterns categories which are presented are created as a design guide rather than on exact principles.
It is possible to code drilling down into another level. This might yield more results. -->

In summary, the coding process is more valuable as a tool to allow more qualitative reflection and analysis rather than a quantitative process as attempted above.

To make a quantitative approach work better X,Y and Z would need to be in place which was not suitable for this study because of A and B.


<!-- How much emphasis to place on the Thematic Analysis is questionable. The process served to help answer the research questions in general way as an additional interpretive tools to aid researcher reflection and to help get close to the data. -->

<!-- I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies [@derry_conducting_2010]. I use a variant of discourse analysis to explore interactions of participants captured on video recordings. Mercer and colleagues identify discourse analysis as a loose associations of methods to support linguistic analysis of interactions to identify emergent patterns [@mercer_methods_2004]. While a common pattern in classroom interactions is that of IRF, initiation (teacher), response (student) and follow up (teacher) [@sinclair_towards_1975] , the inherent assumption that a teacher will be leading an activity will not consistently be appropriate for my study; although at times a parent may take this role. Other discourse analysis frameworks that take a sociocultural approach [@lyle_investigation_1993; @phillips_beyond_1985], and specifically those from project focused studies [@hmelo-silver_facilitating_2008; @moje_maestro_2001] allow more detailed treatment of the incorporation of tools and cultural artefacts into a collective discourse. -->

<!-- To avoid distraction from AT as my principle analytical framework I am in agreement with Wells (1999, p. 172) who proposes the use of AT's concepts to situate 'spoken discourse \... as one, but only one, of the semiotic tools that participants use to achieve the goals of action'. Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals. -->



#### Limits of interview data_

The chief limit is the lack of repeated and regular interview data.

The reason are mostly practical, fitting in additional interviews with families withing a busy schedule.

It was depriorisited and less interviews were conducted than anticipated, and not as regularly.

This reduces factors of reliability as it reduces possibilities for

And prioritising more hands on work which was perceived as more benefitial and welcome by myself.



### Discussion on evolving coding process - PERHAPS SHIFT TO LAST CHAPTER finally

The process of trying to decide a main focus was often tricky.

Take for example the process of Da in 2019-05-08 - where he was leading some fairly advanced work on researching and reading developer documentation and the constructing a new design pattern.

There are competing and overlapping intention and foci here for the participants.
 - Solve immediate problem - add new pattern
 - communicate cultural practice of finding, reading and adapting developer level documentation and help from forums.
 - give hands on experience to the notice coder

Most clearly there is an overlap here between the interpersonal working on a code problem collaboratively for educational purposes and the interactions with the wider cultural artefacts and practices from a professional environment.

Thus the process of writing this up was not neat.
To overcome this issue...

In addition the personal plane was perhaps the most problematic to address given the data gathered.
Even when participants were demonstrating their personal knowledge by sharing back or directly altering game code, this was as part of a social and cultural practice.
Thus my interpretation involved ....




### Generalisation of Research


#### Data Replicability

The elements of the design are online and included in appendices.

This study faces an issue of being culturally embodies, thus think descriptions of context are needed here [@hoadley_creating_2002].

The final chapter addresses the need to replicate this study in different contexts and the challenges involved in replicating the spontaneous emergent elements of specifics of this study.

As such chapter four can be conceptualised as a design narrative (see [@hoadley_creating_2002]) to address the common deficit of detail of the designed product and process. "the usual study presents a technology fully formed as if it had risen from the oceans like Venus herself"

" Would that all interventional research included this kind of rich description of the “treatment” so that one might infer whether the results were applicable elsewhere."

#### Generalisation of Research


Generalisation is one of the guiding principles of DBR. While results are intertwined with context, designs should be assessed for generalisation to other settings.

Explore this in more detail - draw out a debate on how situated learning in this context - and wider debate is.

- More than one iteration.
- In different settings
- Using different with different software

This is potentially complex to describe but worth it if wanting to talk about generalisation.

NOTE - This could be dropped or picked up again in the limitations section

The process of exploring this guided the development of the research questions.





## Discussion on Methodology


### Discussion / Conclusion

NOTE - WHAT KIND OF DISCUSSION WOULD BE NEEDED HERE?
A RETURN TO POSSIBLE BARRIERS THAT THE METHODOLOGY AIMS TO OVER COME



### Authenticity - creating value

IS THIS NOT COVERED IN CHAPTER 3 - UNDER JUSTIFICATION OF APPROACH / THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK?

 Barab and colleagues discuss the importance of creating value in the world in their ecosystem approach [@barnett_ecosystem_2019].
 This mirrors authenticity in applied social approaches - PBL as applied method of - situated learning ontology.



### On the emergent and mutual nature of the design and research process


The experimental team consisted of Home Educating families . Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly.

STAGE ONE
Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.


**On potential of involvement of parents**


The presence of parents adds significant opportunities. I propose that this informal and exploratory setting with the participation of engaged parents, young people and their access to family learning dynamics and wider expertise provides potentially fertile ground in the generation of resources and domain practices. I explore the potential of this theme in more detail in the conclusion of this thesis.  



### How does this methodology relate to existing models of Change Laboratory & DBR and what does that add potentially

Keep this brief.

The smaller time frame of iterations, and more direct intervention in the ongoing / leading activity distiguishes this approach from a Change Laboratory. However, the analysis of tensions, and thus double stimulation to provoke evolutions of agency are alike.

The next chapter focuses in more depth of the mutual evolution of the learning design in a way which aligns with the design narative technique of DBR (hoadley? - find others!)



## Chapter conclusion and link

In line the ethos of formative interventions and DBR this chapter has outlined a methodology which aknowledges the roles of my own input as a scholar/activist and that of participants. The process of working with participant input to the design of the learning intervention served several functions including: access to novel technical approaches proposed by parents and university volunteers; the surfacing of systemic conflicts hidden from my initial perception stemming from my pre-conceptions; observation of participant conflicts spurred the introduction of new tools to support development; and parental proficiency in adapting the learning environment to supporting their children leading to community-wide innovations in practice.

This chapter has described a hybrid approach based on the principles of the Helsinki school's interpretation of  formative intervention, supplemented by naturalistic research methods involving gathering data in-situ to find and describe emerging patterns of behaviour via thick decriptions and the more rapid iterations into the working practices common in DBR in the learning sciences and HCI approaches.


My role as a participant facilitator, designer and researcher presents some challenges which this chapter has addressed. While some decisions were to an extent intuative or reflexive based on my past experiences as a facilation of group productive processes involving technology, and for some this would present issues of validity, the process is in line with a TAS approach.  While my auto-ethnographic notes are too extensive to effectively bring into the data analysis process, they chart the complex and iterative process of refining this reflection into learning and teaching resources. Several samples of journal entries are offered as evidence of this process in Appendix. 4.x

LINK

While the phases and overall structure of the learning design have been presented here, the following chapter, using the a technique of design narrative, explores the evolving areas of contradictions that drive these changes to the evolvling and expanding object of the group game making process.




<!-- Barab and Squire [-@barab_design-based_2004] describe the messiness of design-based research and that this creates a challenge to the researcher of how to present results in a coherent way which is of use to other practitioners. There is a tension between sticking closely to the context of the research and the concrete specifics or stepping back to generalise and being lost in abstraction. Here, I try to strike a balance which stays concrete but which also pulls from my observations a framework which may translate in to other game-making and creative project based approaches.

Another guiding principle of design-based research - which is present in the techniques of design experiments, mutual appropriation and participatory action research - is that research participants also influence the ongoing design of the research [@barab_critical_2004; @cobb_design_2003; @downing-wilson_design_2011]. The design of the research experiment and learning I started from a very open position and has evolved from several iterations of collaborative work with participants. One experimental team consisted of Home Educating families another involved local primary schools with Year 6 (10-11 year old) classes. Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly. Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture. -->





<!-- I have carried out six phases of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline the core activities that have taken place including only the most basic detail on tools used. In following sections, the development of toolsets are analysed in greater depth. The core of the game making programme, which emerged in the first phase and has remained, is a starting template of a simple platform game which participants alter to make their own.

#### Why not use constructivism / constructionism

COMPRESS THIS - ALMOST DROP TOTALLY - NOTE THE GENERAL ALIGNMENT OF CONSTRUCTIONISM WITH DBR METHODS


Hay describes DBR thus "learning occurs within a context of use, learning is frequently collaborative, learning as authentic, learning as inquiry-based not transmission-based" [@hay_constructivism_2001] p. 3. Thus the broad claims are in alignment with wider socio cultural approaches.


Cobb [-@cobb_where_1994] identifies two broad schools of constructivism, one focusing more on individual cognitive processes which follows the work of Piaget and the other drawing on the academic lineage of Vygotsky which locates knowledge formation as a cultural activity.

NOTE - THERE IS IMPORTANT WORK HERE ON AUTENTICITY- and the potential tensions with agency - ie if authenticity is working a the elbows of professionals, students have less ownership over the process.  [@hay_constructivism_2001, p. 34]


**Constructionism as applied learning and design  theory**

Much of the foundational literature on game making names constructionism as a guiding theory  (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996).

Constructionism as a movement has done important work in creating design guidelines but much weaker as either an underlying theoretical or analytical framework.

Some PhD studies, many from MIT,  use it as a guiding theory [Roque]

It can be viewed as a design technique based on constructivist roots [@kynigos_constructionism]

Constructionism is also described as  a theory of learning by Noss [@noss2015reconstructing] rather than a methodology. -->



### How Research Questions Evolved - JUSTIFICATION FOR CHANING FOCUS.



was driven by

Possible themes that had potential but which were disguarded included;

- Computation thinking & systems thinking
- Aligning with Project based learning

Themes emerging include the alternation of abstract and concrete as a suggested learning journey, explored in my journal. However this seems to be explored in research on semantic waves with studies of more breadth so it did not seem a good idea to follow that thread in my thesis.

There was something about the formalisation of this process into graph form which put me off. I also realised that the frameworks that I spent a while trying to make accessible and gameful in the design, grouping and theming of their presentation, had strong similarities to concepts of abstract curriculum if explored through a semantic waves lens. Curriculum seemed too well a well trod path for a PhD thesis.  

Instead the community elements of the learning experience regained focus during the process of coding. There were particularly interesting elements of the learning environment which contributed to notable behaviours.

The area of in-depth study of learning and wider behaviours in the development of coding. Work on roles by Barron  and developed by Roque showed promise identifying helpful roles and reflecting them back to participants. Such reflection sessions were not always replicable with a general home education group or other non-formal setting.  Could this implemented in the design, in the way reflective techniques were implemented in to games. Thus making it more playful/ gameful.
