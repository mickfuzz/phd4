    Da: Have you thought about pushing it a bit further and have a different style of game?
    Te: What do you mean?
    Da: Well the previous style of game was a platform (makes shape with hands) game wasn’t it? You went along and there was gravity pushing down (points down). There are other types of games aren’t there?
    Te: Pause. I don’t know what to do thought.
    Da: Well quite but what other games are there?
    Te: I don’t know er.
    Da: Well I tell you what .. muffled.
    Te: Erm - (navigates to list of GDP for platform game)
    De: So. You played them before didn’t you (indicating grid of games )
    Te: What do you mean?
    Da: The flying game that’s a different kind of game
    Te: Oh like kind of like moving along kind of thing
    Da: Yeah and those where. There are games where you are in a world and you have to move around the world like pac-man (points down and moves an imaginary character around),
    Te: nod
    Da: There are games where things drop down like Tetris
    Te: … game. You could have a game where every 15 seconds 10 seconds you could add and enemy to such and such a random number between such and such (holds up hands to indicate parameters). You could block it somewhere.
    Da: So instead of.. instead of the world… the world being sideways. We could have the world being looked down on. (reindicates the change of perspective)
    Te: Hmm. How should I do this then?
    Da: That’s a good question. Shall we ask Mick to see if that would mess things up or not?  
    Te: Mick
    Mick: Hi ya.
    Te: Erm. Thinking about what game to do . I was thinking can we make like a pacman game kind of thing (indicates movement of character with hands)
    Da: If we had an on the top game rather than a platform game
    Mick: I think it could work. You could kind of adapt that game by kind of removing gravity.
    Da: and see what happens?
    Mick: and see what happens.
    Da: It’s not a bad starting idea is it?
    Te: I suppose make a new one (begins the process of remixing game from the template)


## Glossary
NOTE THIS COULD MAKE UP PART OF THE LITERATURE REVIEW AS A MORE CONCISE WAY TO COVER A LOT OF GROUND - AND BOOKMARKED BY A JUSTIFICATION - THE COMPLEXITY IS IN THE MIX OF CONCEPTS AND IN LATER CHAPTERS.

Or perhaps group terms by theme, include references in each description with examples and characteristics. Then have a short complex commentary at the end of each section.  

### Pedagogy

**Pair programming:** Beyond a more general description of two people coding a task side by side, this terms also describes a  

**Use - Modify - Create:** A computing and digital media creation pedagogy that outlines the advantages of starting with working code examples before progressing to writing code structures from first principles. It has been used in the context of game making[find example], web design[find example] and other educational coding projects.
