## Introduction

This chapter describes:


- data gathering and processing
- data analysis explored in stages
- comments on data validity, replicability and ethical considerations
- an overview of the design stages of the study




<!-- My own research in game making is an experimental approach to create a new learning design. I have worked with young learners, local families and undergraduate student helpers to evolve a game making design. A key driver of my research was to explore the potential to draw on family experience in learning activities by working with families to make games together. -->


## Data Collection

This section addresses data collection.

While the next chapter outlines the evolution of the learning intervention as a design narrative, the following table presents a summary of the phases involved to help situation this chapters description of data collection.

### Justification of data collection and selection

#### Alignment with with socio cultural approach

The methodology of the data collection and analysis process is informed by socio-cultural approaches. If found the work of Rogoff in particular to research community oriented processes particularly illuminating

The process is a suitable approach for informal education.

As previously explored, the research questions invite a broad spectrum of analysis - cultural and social factors.

<!-- The depth justifies smaller data size and depth of analysis. -->

Here I adopt a naturalistic (is this the right word) research approach involves gathering data in situ to find and describe patterns of behaviour.

Large amounts of video data were being gathered, a challenge which is explored later in this chapter

Turning attention to the gathering and analysis of other data, such a rich set of data, will allow the cross referencing of the many sources.

While diversity of data invites drawing on diverse methods of analysis (3 planes, DBR approaches), ATs provide a foundation for the analysis of these diverse data.

<!-- WHAT IS THE FOUNDATION FOR ANALYSIS ?
CERTAINLY FINDING AND RESOLVING TENSIONS.

There is a framework for looking at tensions here.
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sce.21254?casa_token=cBrHq4V42XUAAAAA:qLvlA17sLIGDHnxN_XqTgZpBDP39phmbLXVzu6QFn89LzBtXshp-y4hFVmi2CvmWTYdj50XNe2qSqg -->






### Challenges of data collection and processing

While the rich set of data invites the cross referencing of the many sources, it also presents challenge on how to deal effectively with the large amounts of data being gathered. The use of a 360 camera reduces the amount of live video footage of interactions needed. Instead of multiple cameras pointed in different directions to capture participant interaction, participants are arranged in a square pointing inwards towards a central 360 degree camera.

<!-- I use a software sustainability approach also influenced by a personal modification of permaculture computing ideas and ideas of free software and open document approaches. The very nature of working with video is time consuming. -->
<!-- There is sometimes a danger of imagining how a new data gathering tool could be useful but then not being aware of all of the potential pitfalls which can make processing the data time consuming. Also  -->
<!-- On a personal note, I sometimes like the challenges involved and sometimes find them infuriating. It can be like a specialist knowledge which you can use as a currency, or as a hidden knowledge that you take pride in sharing. -->

<!-- I use a software sustainability approach also influenced by a personal modification of permaculture computing ideas and ideas of free software and open document approaches.

- Data portability and interoperability
- Software sustainability, in particular longevity
- Licencing - FLOSS licence ?
- If proprietary - then what is the business model?
- Is batch processing of files possible?
- It it a cross platform approach - in particular can I use it on debian based linux systems?

I also take a more practical approach which takes into account working with peers and that such advocacy is not a core part of my job or this research.

Such an attitude may involve compromises or hacking systems, software or processes -->

#### 360 Video Processing

The processing of video and audio data of both captured screens and 360 video data and high quality audio data involved several stages yielding advantages in capturing the gestures and facial expressions of potentially all participants in one recording. It does however present challenges. While this merits further exploration a brief summary of challenges is presented here.

The process involves large video files that are easily corrupted in transfer. While the files are split into 8 minute segments  but also can be confusing
- time navigation - also confusing - sometimes put up on the screen - but inconsistently
- moving and keeping a track of data from week to week and over years is complex.
- processing data requires special software - from samsung
- viewing data on a normal vlc player - needs extra processing using spatial media

<!-- Tech details are logged here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6m20wehYkTeevj9QucpzKCR4NioELndg2rZeLWFK-c/edit# -->


This whole process is so demanding in terms of careful file management. Making me create a linux command line toolbox which is included as a technical appendix. [A draft of which is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7MsZDY8ofvls5XO7tztSu8KFdClJo09o3qpWOdkb2M/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=11432580350275268987)


#### Screen Capture Processing

I chose the software flashback pro primarily as it was intalled on and availble at low cost on home computers. Flashback saves data in a format. This include audio, video screen capture, learner keystrokes, mouse movements and optionally one or more webcams. I decided not to record on webcams for the following reasons:

- intrusive feel - having the webcam on and the resulting red light on the screen, I felt was less conducive to feeling comfortable than one 360 camera in the middle of the room.
- less resources - recording webcam on the laptop
- reduced video file size of final data file
- less complexity when processing data -

It not possible to code the natively created files directly. Thus need to be converted to mp4 to import into coding software like Nvivo. In this process the keyboard and mouse data is lost.

<!-- Thus original files have been retained in order to cross reference that data if it is useful. It also presents other options for analysis which are similar to much more in depth analysis of HCI research of professional set ups. While this is beyond the remit of this study, certain uses do present themselves strongly for future investigation. Particularly the study of such data to identify common mistakes or frustrations when interacting with the user interface. Such misconceptions could be addressed in direct teaching at the start of the next session. -->



#### Learnings and recommendations on processing

The following learning and recommendations emerged from this process.

Prioritise displaying time - have an old school clock under the 360 camera. For example.

Check viability of data at each stage of processing and movement.


## Data Analysis


My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer, participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. I also record the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants.

One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour.

### Notes to allocate to a stage

#### Rational and approach of data analysis -


Video data analysis involved description and transcription of video data and thematic analysis of the contents.



<!-- The gathering of data and revision of teaching materials took place over several years. As such, there was time for extensive reflection and reconsideration of factors involved in the learning design in dialogue with existing literature on game making and game making communities. -->



Analysis was in different forms, and drew on additional forms of data gathering.

- Broad dipping into sessions via 360 video, advantages, focusing on community interactions, disadvantages of
- Transcription and annoation of video capture footage in parallel with 360 data
- Coding of sections of video to both emergent themes and themes relating to the reseearch questions.

NOTE - Import more from the post of 2024- 05 - 08 - in diary.


### Data Analysis Stage One

As outline in the table above, stage one involved initial broad analysis of td varied forms of data and recording observations in an excel sheet.


Rather than taking a grounded approach this data was analysed using 3 planes of sociocultural activity. The existing relevant framework saves time, especially as a more emergent approach was  (in part ) in coding video data.

WHY NOT GROUNDED? OR TO WHAT EXTENT WAS IT GROUNDED? IN THE AREA OF INTERPERSONAL ACTIVITY.


#### 3 planes approach - noting tensions and behaviours

RQx addresses the formation of a game-making community. This process is co-constituted by planners, facilitators, parents and children.

Following the approach of Morcom [@morcom_scaffolding_2014] I drew on Rogoff's  [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of sociocultural activity used to help understand activity in a Community of Learners.

I created an excel spreadsheet and noted behaviour and tentions that emerged in transcription and coding.

This helped to get closer to the data and to :

  - start identify to  thematic analysis of the stages of design with other learning models like PBL
- to identify roles through repeated patterns of interactions, and contrast to Barron's work
- to reflect on the thesis questions


While the three planes provided a higher level framework, specifics of the data gave greater granularity and formed sub categories of coding





<!-- Rather than taking a grounded approach this data was analysed using 3 planes of sociocultural activity. The existing relevant framework saves time, especially as a more emergent approach was  (in part ) in coding video data. -->

<!-- The process aligns with AT analysis in the scope of the activity - and in the separation out of the community level of the triangle added by Engestrom . -->




 - The advantages of drawing on funds of knowledge, and the activities that I used to do this, as well as connecting to wider communities are address well with the plane of culture, in the concept of Apprenticeship.


<!-- While more complex, the plane of more individual participatory appropriation, allows for alignment and then transfer to more formal learning environments. This then makes this research more relevant to class room and guided sessions. -->








#### Justification of selecting sessions and sections for more detailed analysis

Then deciding on 8-10 video sessions warranting full coding of activity.
This was based on the following factors, quality of recording, how much activity, richness of interactions, a range of diffent kinds of participant interactions.


Criteria  for inclusion included both practical and theoretical considerations.

- Good quality recording
- Diversity of kinds of participants, ages especially
- Diversity of participant actions in terms of tasks being worked on
- Diversity of kinds of pair and peer interactions


A page of quick analysis of the files online here helped to shape that decision on what sections
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpAIqHPg_Z0S5MWeS0rBTvxCL1N9NQButam4Ozq39Ek/edit#


### Data Analysis Stage Two

Schema for initial thematic analysis in stage two  was informed by literature review, early analysis of journal entries and  emerging observations of data in stage one


#### Partial transcription/description of data

The partial transcription of video data formed a significant part of the data analysis. The large amount of video data recorded forced a prioritisation of data to be transcribed. It also forced a partial transcription process which was in part descriptive and in other parts involved a closer transcription of the words spoken by participants.

To aid the process of coding, I broke up analysis of  in 5 minute sections. In addition, when these sections were described I imported data into nvivo and coded each of the 5 minute sections to the

This limited the accuracy of the process. In part, this element of the research was limited by the practicalities of working with this amount of data.

I priorised more data as this was needed to get a greater scope of activity to allow analysis of wider community activity and ...

#### Partial coding of video at stage 2


Thematic analysis is commonly done in stages, each revision building on insights of the previous one.

While sstage one surfaced themes, stage two created a coding structure in nvido


Summary of thematic analysis - https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/uploads/production/document/path/18/18247/Kiger_and_Varpio__2020__Thematic_analysis_of_qualitative_data_AMEE_Guide_No_131.pdf

Video coded in segments in Nivivo - Stage 2
In this level, the rough coding involved by breaking up video timescales into 5 minute sections lessens the ability to make exact claims however for this study it opens up lines of initial questioning which can be explored in future studies or triangulated with other data in this study.


Describing different grades and pass overs of the video data.

- quick analysis
- sections coded and described in 5 minute chunks
- themes of interest identified - in relation to evolving RQs as per DBR
- some sections transcribed in more details based in themes, more detail on gesture analysis also added




#### What was excluded from initial coding and why

The following themes  emerge as potential learning outcomes in the learning model, and were observed in interactions in stage one

- Elements of Computational Thinking
- Systems Thinking Concepts

However, they were note included at stage 2 as there is other extensive or focused work in these fields (previously explored in the literature review) on CT which this study which this study does not need to replicate.

##### Coding Participant Roles and Interactions.

Evolving notes on coding of roles and interactions are in an online document here.

Excel doc -    https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit

Roles are different from interactions existing on a higher order of anaysis. Repeated patterns of interactions can be seen to develop into roles. Thus a more grounded approach may concentrate initially on interactions and develop this to become roles through analysis. However, many roles exist in other similar domains.

For example, the work of my own staring point when coding was guided by Barron and colleagues work on the roles of parents as learning partners [-@barron_parents_2009]. The roles are as follows: Teacher, Collaborator, Learning Broker, Resource Provider, Nontechnical Consultant, Employer, and Learner.

when coding I started with some preset codes from the literature for examples Barron's codes on parent roles when helping digital projects. However, as coding progressed, I modified and extended these codes to better match the data I was working with

Specifically, the following were removed from Barron's typology, parent as employer, non-technical consultant. Learning broker and resource provider were merged as some of the detail of those roles involve take place outside of the learning environment being analysed in coded video.

 I judged it appropriate to and less complex to analyse and code the interaction between participants rather than code the behaviours by participant type.

##### Coding Design Cycle Stages

There are similar stage based approaches to creating a digital project. Firstly project based learning (PBL), then Inquiry based learning, finally design thinking. This design could adopt any one of these, however the creation of a digital product more closely resembles a design approach with testing stages of the created product.

The design process characteristics are broadly as follows; the process is often iterative, involves evaluation and separates planning from implementation.

Resnick in this area has written of a creative design spiral.

The model is similar to the ADDIE model from instructional system design: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. The discipline of teaching engineering also has a similar design stage cycle with many contesting variations [@winarno_steps_2020]. Engineering is Elementary project adapted from the ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) guidelines [@syukri_impact_2018] involves the following steps; Ask, Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share [@hester_engineering_2007].

It has been adopted by the area of computing is one used in a recent book on coding by Bers [@bers_coding_2021].

It is possible to be more specific when coding and include a wider terminology of technology and domain specific language. For example, debugging in the area of computer programming and playtesting in the domain of game making. I have had to weigh up the value of including these more specific terms and deciding to keep a more generic approach primarily to reduce complexity while undertaking video coding. Sub-categories add complexity and time to the process without necessarity adding a great deal.  
ADD IN A JUSTIFICATION BASED ON HOW RESULTS PAN OUT.

<!-- ##### Coding Game Design Patterns

NOTE THIS IS NOT REALLY USED IN DATA - thus make minimal - OR MOVE - IN DESIGN? PROBABLY JUST REFERENCE REALLY BRIEFLY AND PICK UP IN DESIGN

OR DROP TOTALLY! eg.

I was interested in the question what could  coding based on the different game elements that are being added to the game serves to illustrate.

The process of learning game making through deepening your knowledge of game elements is explored by Schell [-@schell_art_2008].

As way of coding initially I considered the MDA framework for the simplicity and the focus on the user experience being taken into account.

- mechanics
- aesthetics
- dynamics

Finally I adapted this framework to match the one use for documentation.

- Game mechanics
- Game Challenge
- Game Space
- Game Polish (aesthetics)

This had the following limits.

- didn't really add much to
- in someways the division was arbitrary

Also, while helpful in preparing resources as a navigational framework, as explored in chapters four and five, the coding to participant engagement with creating different areas of game elements / design pattern, it did not yield particularly interesting insights in itself. However, in coding I noted the use of the game design patterns as mediational strategies which overlapped with the -->



#### Selection of vignettes for deeper analysis

- Full transcription of key moments: and description of participant activity, activity on screen including simple gesture analysis

Used in chapters to orient the reader


**Incorporating  movement around the room in analysis**

The 360 camera allowed for side by side analyis of the group, pair or individual working. Due to the layout these were cluster often around a laptop.

In the initial stages of transcription and description having this data was extremely useful to disambiguate spoken statements.

As a personal experience of describing and transcribing even thought it was a significant amount of work to synchronise and then to play both video sources side by side, the additional information really aided the description process in adding detail to the interpretations of motivations of participants.  

For an example see the vignette in appendix 6.x (Suzanna and Olivia) chapter 6 which details the movement and behaviours of the child away from the computer as an example of legitimate peripheral activity.



**Simple gesture analysis**

In some exchanges, 360 data was vital to explain spoken word.

This helped clarify some things that were unclear from audio and screen capture data.


For example, deictic referencing, where unclear statements were clafied with pointing or other gestures was common. Such gesture were used often  to clarify game movements on screen, or in one case a software procedure of cropping an image.



#### Analysis of the evolution of the programme resources created

There were two main types of resources created.

- supporting teaching / facilitation RESOURCES
- games and game and assets created

The documentation and other forms of support evolved during each phase -

I did not try to collect any personal notes that participants used for planning. And this was minimal for many participants.

Chapter four explores the evolutin of these resources using AT as a tool for analysis of the existing and emerging contradictions in activity.

### Data Analysis Stage Three

After drafts of the emerging themes were in place, these were sued to create a revised coding structure and data was recoded more systematically. .

**Integrate the thoughts here**
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6m20wehYkTeevj9QucpzKCR4NioELndg2rZeLWFK-c/edit#bookmark=id.k9kvu0182p6u


#### A revised processes of thematic analysis

What was really needed - Prioritising the selection of data and quick reading of it in nvivo

Complexities - thus rejecting comparative approach.


After data analysis in stage one. The following revisions were made in overall schema of coding.

While useful, I dropping design stages as a schema, for justification and implications see discussion in chapter six.



The wider helping interactions, again while useful had drawbacks. Firsly, they were so numerous. Secondly, given the existing work of a general scope of digital making by Barron, it was not clear what I would add in terms of contribution to knowledge beyond broadly confirming it in the scope of digital game making.

Instead, an area that was more targetted emerged from these areas.

 <!-- The analysis of these resources using the three planes involved a choice of some of the following
- using a spread sheet and putting categories and notes in to columns
- using a table in word to record notes on data in-situ -->

<!-- The video data explored in nvivo is very time consuming, and given this and the factor that the transforming reflections into  learning resources, already involves a process of filtering, a much courser level of data analysis. -->

<!-- However, using a static text only approach such as describing data in prose or using a table in a word document does not allow for filtering based on themes which is potentially useful as an analytical too.   -->

<!-- Thus using MS Excel as a simple way to collate data without translation seems appropriate. -->

##### Coding use of GDPs as mediational strategies
This is explored in chapter 5

##### Coding impact on design/ processes on learner agency - boiled down -

<!-- NOTE  I would say no - too complex for coding  -->

REMOVED AS PROPOSAL BUT INSTEAD HOW TO ADDRESS THIS?

FIND ANOTHER FRAMEWORK FOR AGENCY AND CODE TO THAT.

Answering RQ - on pedagogical resources / agency / use of GDPs

THIS IMAGINED FOR CONCLUSION BUT ALSO CODE TO IT? OR ABOVE?

- learners developing agency through personal expression of home and other Identities
- agency through choice over pathway via GDPS
- agency through flexible design cycle pathways, especially via community playtesting
- developing agency through celebration of different game maker styles
- authenticity of tool use, especially docs and access to Community
- authenticity of audience - and role of drama to facilitate reflection





#### On Final Transcription/description of data

At this stage coding schemes were more mature.

- Partial transcription of more video files -


The coding of each extract via a selction was the process. To better aid analysis via Nvivo selections

MORE TO COME HERE




### Use of journal data


My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music.

<!-- To be able to effectively analyse these diverse sources, I will need to prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes. I explore some of the emerging themes and criteria for selection which incidents to explore in depth in the results section below. -->

The process of analysis of journal notes and resulting resources required a different approach from that of video data.

The following resources were examined

- Book Journal pages
- Digital journal entries directly in response to teaching sessions

-
<!-- - Linear support book and print outs to support participants in sessions
- Additional 3M model resources to help navigation and reflection and gameful approaches -->

Journal Notes were used in the following ways: (perhaps code this)

- as a reflective tool after sessions
- as a note pad to plan resource creation
- as a sketch pad to explore the relationship between Concepts being explored and existing game making frameworks
- as a

The quantity of data prevented extensive and detailed coding using thematic analysis.

Instead, observations are triangulated with data from lit review to expose key themes and tensions.

My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use and other relevant interests.


<!-- AT allows an exploration these diverse sources of information as mediating artefacts which are the enabler and product of the shifting goals and outcomes of the programmes participants. -->

<!-- A key strategy of AT used to locate learning happening in an environment, is via the identification of contradictions between different elements of the activity systems and subsequent study of how these contradictions are resolved (EngestrÃ¶m and Sannino, 2010). I plan to use my journal and participant interviews to identify key moments of contradictions and resolution to study in greater detail using the range of data available. I am also inspired by the work of Oliver and Pelletier (2006)who employed contradictions between systemic elements to create a coding scheme used to interpret video data in a study on game based learning. -->


### Use of Interview data

Practitioner data used to inform themse for dvideo ANALYSIS

Participant interview data mostly used to confirm and triangulate with video data from making sessions

#### Practitioner  interviews

Four practitioner interviews were a rich source of thinking to help develop and deepen my reflection on key issues, to develop lines of thinking and to expose and explore barriers to participation in projects, tactics to address them and tensions experienced by practitioners and participants in similar creative coding projects.

The interviews were semi-structured allowing me to ask follow up questions to gain more detail on areas of interest.  

The chosen interviewees represented a certain diversity in audience however as these interview are limited in number, resulting data are also explore in relation to existing research and no broad claims are made from this data alone.

#### Participant interviews

These interviews took place at the end of between P3 and P4.

At times the resources that the

These interviews allowed triangulation and confirmation of data observered in video recordings.

**Limitations in interview data**

MOVE TO CONCLUSION
In retrospect, shorter interviews at more regular intervals with participants would have been useful to answer


## Data validity, replicability and reliability and decisions of what to not analyse


<!-- NOTE - MOVE THIS? DOESN'T SEEM TO FLOW IN THIS SECTION -->


### Data Validity - Triangulation of Data - THE THEORY

Draw on other chapters to represent overcoming of weaknesses of design-based approach.

Having a wide based on data allowed data triangulation
e.g.  find a dood example of finding confirmation in interview data


#### Limits of / problems with video data analysis

The choice of the videos to code more fully is rather skewed towards finding interesting data. Thus it may not be fully representative of the experience of all participants.

Choosing in a different way - around less interaction - would expose more barriers to participation to game making using the 3M model.
<!-- For example in

Only suitable pairs were chosen. This removes a lot of validity from any generalisation of claims that could be made.

Breaking of data into 5 min sections is practical but does not allow for some of the finer interactions and changes of behaviour to be accurately coded.  There may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granular detail.

<!-- The game elements / design patterns categories which are presented are created as a design guide rather than on exact principles.
It is possible to code drilling down into another level. This might yield more results. -->

In summary, the coding process is more valuable as a tool to allow more qualitative reflection and analysis rather than a quantitative process as attempted above.

To make a quantitative approach work better X,Y and Z would need to be in place which was not suitable for this study because of A and B.


<!-- How much emphasis to place on the Thematic Analysis is questionable. The process served to help answer the research questions in general way as an additional interpretive tools to aid researcher reflection and to help get close to the data. -->

<!-- I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies [@derry_conducting_2010]. I use a variant of discourse analysis to explore interactions of participants captured on video recordings. Mercer and colleagues identify discourse analysis as a loose associations of methods to support linguistic analysis of interactions to identify emergent patterns [@mercer_methods_2004]. While a common pattern in classroom interactions is that of IRF, initiation (teacher), response (student) and follow up (teacher) [@sinclair_towards_1975] , the inherent assumption that a teacher will be leading an activity will not consistently be appropriate for my study; although at times a parent may take this role. Other discourse analysis frameworks that take a sociocultural approach [@lyle_investigation_1993; @phillips_beyond_1985], and specifically those from project focused studies [@hmelo-silver_facilitating_2008; @moje_maestro_2001] allow more detailed treatment of the incorporation of tools and cultural artefacts into a collective discourse. -->

<!-- To avoid distraction from AT as my principle analytical framework I am in agreement with Wells (1999, p. 172) who proposes the use of AT's concepts to situate 'spoken discourse \... as one, but only one, of the semiotic tools that participants use to achieve the goals of action'. Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals. -->






### Discussion on evolving coding process - PERHAPS SHIFT TO LAST CHAPTER finally

The process of trying to decide a main focus was often tricky.

Take for example the process of Da in 2019-05-08 - where he was leading some fairly advanced work on researching and reading developer documentation and the constructing a new design pattern.

There are competing and overlapping intention and foci here for the participants.
 - Solve immediate problem - add new pattern
 - communicate cultural practice of finding, reading and adapting developer level documentation and help from forums.
 - give hands on experience to the notice coder

Most clearly there is an overlap here between the interpersonal working on a code problem collaboratively for educational purposes and the interactions with the wider cultural artefacts and practices from a professional environment.

Thus the process of writing this up was not neat.
To overcome this issue...

In addition the personal plane was perhaps the most problematic to address given the data gathered.
Even when participants were demonstrating their personal knowledge by sharing back or directly altering game code, this was as part of a social and cultural practice.
Thus my interpretation involved ....




### Generalisation of Research


#### Data Replicability

The elements of the design are online and included in appendices.

This study faces an issue of being culturally embodies, thus think descriptions of context are needed here [@hoadley_creating_2002].

The final chapter addresses the need to replicate this study in different contexts and the challenges involved in replicating the spontaneous emergent elements of specifics of this study.

As such chapter four can be conceptualised as a design narrative (see [@hoadley_creating_2002]) to address the common deficit of detail of the designed product and process. "the usual study presents a technology fully
formed as if it had risen from the oceans like Venus herself"

" Would that all interventional research included this kind of rich description of the âtreatmentâ so that one might infer whether the results were applicable elsewhere."

#### Generalisation of Research


Generalisation is one of the guiding principles of DBR. While results are intertwined with context, designs should be assessed for generalisation to other settings.

Explore this in more detail - draw out a debate on how situated learning in this context - and wider debate is.

- More than one iteration.
- In different settings
- Using different with different software

This is potentially complex to describe but worth it if wanting to talk about generalisation.

NOTE - This could be dropped or picked up again in the limitations section

The process of exploring this guided the development of the research questions.


#### Ethical and Practica issues impacting the formative intervention of this research - MOVED HERE CHECK

<!-- The design of the research experiment and learning I started from a very open position and has evolved from several iterations of collaborative work with participants. -->




**Practical factors**

Key contextual factors have facilitated and shaped development of the research design including:

- Impact of research practicalities
- The location at the university

<!-- Eliza effect? If so how relevant? -->

The availability of resources potentially  attractive to this audience.

For example, the ability to have that number of identical computers for this audience in particular drove participipation to be in a university setting.  

and using this shape of working which was determined by technical reasons but which had an impact nevertheless on the ability for students to move around the room and the absence of a front for the teacher to teach from.

Motivating or other effect of being part of a research project (Eliza) may be present. However, this study does not make comparative claims.

<!-- In early stages of delivery I adopted an open project based approach. I will later describe how this evolved in to a template game using a javascript game making library and an online tool used for phases 1-4 which participants were invited to add to and alter.

The last iterations of the learning design adopted the MakeCode Arcade tool as a new game authoring tool. This block based programming environment reduced participant coding errors allowing a greater focus on game making concepts. -->


## Research Questions

<!-- - What  game making pedagogies exist?
- DROP? What methods exist to scaffold / seed the creation of a game / digital making community of learners? And what value does a community have?
- How can game patterns support the development of coding practices by novices?
- How can parent and child participant experiences of a community focused digital game making programme inform broader digital making practices? -->


### How Research Questions Evolved  

The process was driven by the activity of collaborative game making driven by practicalities, and my interests as explored in the first chapter.

As justified by DBR and formative interventions, the process was driven by a meeting of context and the needs / interests of myself as a researcher.

Possible themes that had potential but which were disguarded included;

- Computation thinking & systems thinking
- Aligning with Project based learning

Themes emerging include the alternation of abstract and concrete as a suggested learning journey, explored in my journal. However this seems to be explored in research on semantic waves with studies of more breadth so it did not seem a good idea to follow that thread in my thesis.

There was something about the formalisation of this process into graph form which put me off. I also realised that the frameworks that I spent a while trying to make accessible and gameful in the design, grouping and theming of their presentation, had strong similarities to concepts of abstract curriculum if explored through a semantic waves lens. Curriculum seemed too well a well trod path for a PhD thesis.  

Instead the community elements of the learning experience regained focus during the process of coding. There were particularly interesting elements of the learning environment which contributed to notable behaviours.

The area of in-depth study of learning and wider behaviours in the development of coding. Work on roles by Barron  and developed by Roque showed promise identifying helpful roles and reflecting them back to participants. Such reflection sessions were not always replicable with a general home education group or other non-formal setting.  Could this implemented in the design, in the way reflective techniques were implemented in to games. Thus making it more playful/ gameful.

## Discussion on Methodology


### Discussion / Conclusion

NOTE - WHAT KIND OF DISCUSSION WOULD BE NEEDED HERE?
A RETURN TO POSSIBLE BARRIERS THAT THE METHODOLOGY AIMS TO OVER COME


Perhaps summarise the the context, and motivations of the above case studies are analysed in relation to the context of this study.

### Authenticity - creating value

 Barab and colleagues discuss the importance of creating value in the world in their ecosystem approach [@barnett_ecosystem_2019].
 This mirrors authenticity in applied social approaches - PBL as applied method of - situated learning ontology.








### On the emergent and mutual nature of the design and research process


The experimental team consisted of Home Educating families . Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly.

Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.


The value of participant input to intervention-based research in the domain of technology use is well explored via participatory research  [@iversen_computational_2018-1; @iivari_critical_2017], design-based approaches [@papavlasopoulou_exploring_2019; @barab_design-based_2004] and formative interventions [@cole_fifth_2006; @blunden_formative_2023]. In line with these research perspectives, the development of the tools and processes used by participants in this study emerged in response to my analysis of participant experience and their direct feedback. This process is particularly evident in the evolution of the learning design and resources. The trialling of the coding environment and starting templated occurred in various informal settings, over the course of two years and with input and concrete additions from parent volunteers, graduate trainee-teacher students, undergraduate students helpers University colleagues and with more indirect ongoing feedback from participating young people and their guardians.

While a full description of how this happened is beyond the remit of this chapter, this external input served several functions including: access to novel technical approaches proposed by parents and university volunteers; the surfacing of systemic conflicts hidden from my initial perception stemming from my pre-conceptions; observation of participant conflicts spurred the introduction of new tools to support development; and parental proficiency in adapting the learning environment to supporting their children leading to community-wide innovations in practice. My role as a facilitator included recognising and supporting the emergence of a repertoire of varied emergent practices in the responses of participants, and then to support these practices with suitable tools and resources. In this way, I support participants to build agency in their transformation of learning process.

While some of these dynamics are already well explored in work surrounding the 5th Dimension project [@cole_fifth_2006] (explored in the literature review), the presence of parents adds significant opportunities. I propose that this informal and exploratory setting with the participation of engaged parents, young people and their access to family learning dynamics and wider expertise provides potentially fertile ground in the generation of resources and domain practices. I explore the potential of this theme in more detail in the conclusion of this thesis.  


#### Note on creation of learning and teaching resources  

THIS IS COVERED IN THE NEXT CHATPER

The process of refining this reflection into learning and teaching resources was complex and iterative. The following paragraph illustrates the process using a case study?

<!-- Barab and Squire [-@barab_design-based_2004] describe the messiness of design-based research and that this creates a challenge to the researcher of how to present results in a coherent way which is of use to other practitioners. There is a tension between sticking closely to the context of the research and the concrete specifics or stepping back to generalise and being lost in abstraction. Here, I try to strike a balance which stays concrete but which also pulls from my observations a framework which may translate in to other game-making and creative project based approaches.

Another guiding principle of design-based research - which is present in the techniques of design experiments, mutual appropriation and participatory action research - is that research participants also influence the ongoing design of the research [@barab_critical_2004; @cobb_design_2003; @downing-wilson_design_2011]. The design of the research experiment and learning I started from a very open position and has evolved from several iterations of collaborative work with participants. One experimental team consisted of Home Educating families another involved local primary schools with Year 6 (10-11 year old) classes. Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly. Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture. -->





<!-- I have carried out six phases of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline the core activities that have taken place including only the most basic detail on tools used. In following sections, the development of toolsets are analysed in greater depth. The core of the game making programme, which emerged in the first phase and has remained, is a starting template of a simple platform game which participants alter to make their own. The evolution of different versions and locations of this starting template has proven to be a key marker of the progress of the programme. The timeline of phases of activities is outlined in the following table.

#### Why not use constructivism / constructionism

COMPRESS THIS - ALMOST DROP TOTALLY - NOTE THE GENERAL ALIGNMENT OF CONSTRUCTIONISM WITH DBR METHODS


Hay describes DBR thus "learning occurs within a context of use, learning is frequently collaborative, learning as authentic, learning as inquiry-based not transmission-based" [@hay_constructivism_2001] p. 3. Thus the broad claims are in alignment with wider socio cultural approaches.


Cobb [-@cobb_where_1994] identifies two broad schools of constructivism, one focusing more on individual cognitive processes which follows the work of Piaget and the other drawing on the academic lineage of Vygotsky which locates knowledge formation as a cultural activity.

NOTE - THERE IS IMPORTANT WORK HERE ON AUTENTICITY- and the potential tensions with agency - ie if authenticity is working a the elbows of professionals, students have less ownership over the process.  [@hay_constructivism_2001, p. 34]


**Constructionism as applied learning and design  theory**

Much of the foundational literature on game making names constructionism as a guiding theory  (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996).

Constructionism as a movement has done important work in creating design guidelines but much weaker as either an underlying theoretical or analytical framework.

Some PhD studies, many from MIT,  use it as a guiding theory [Roque]

It can be viewed as a design technique based on constructivist roots [@kynigos_constructionism]

Constructionism is also described as  a theory of learning by Noss [@noss2015reconstructing] rather than a methodology.
