## Introduction

The potential of digital game making is explored in depth in a review by Kafai and Burke [-@kafai_constructionist_2015]. The most prominent learning objective of making games in educational setting is to develop _coding and computing skills_. There are extensive studies on _game making to learn other subjects_ including maths, biology and chemistry but diverse examples exist. Game making can also develop social skills, self-reflection, cultural awareness and a range of technical abilities that allow participation in information society. Finally, because, game making involves a systems-based understanding of the world, and as games are themselves interactive systems, they are a powerful vehicle for exploring complex problems involving race, sex, social issues [@tekinbas_quest_2010].

While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research. New software tools to make games which offer new pedagogical possibilities emerge regularly. Game playing practices and the opportunities provided by participation in wider communities also continue to evolve. For example, casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014]. My study, in part, asks how the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities can be brought into more structured educational environments.   

In this chapter, I explore the potential of digital game making as an inclusive way of developing coding concepts and coding fluency in the later stages of Primary Education. This chapter begins with a short summary of the United Kingdom (UK) context of coding and inclusion. This is followed by a section on game making as an inclusive, project-based teaching approach. I then describe two game making tools used in my study before outlining the process of the development of a learning design in partnership with participants. I end with an overview of what I provisionally call the 3M game making learning design and offer links to the resulting resources suitable for learners and fellow practitioners.

<!-- This chapter contains (CHANGE THIS LATER TO PROSE not bullet points):

<!-- Later I outline tactics to resolve common tensions when undertaking educational game-making projects. I do this using an extended case study from my own research in the form of a pedagogical design called the 3M game making model.

Through this model I explore the value of game making to support the development of coding using a project based approach. Specifically the value of design patterns and authenticity of project work are described. In particular, I outline the value of resources and activities to support learners with project navigation and motivation. -->

<!-- In this chapter I outline a case study and model for game making designed with to align with project-based and inclusive pedagogies.

I identify and describe design tensions emerging from the exploratory stages of my PhD study on families making games together.

I share a learning design incorporate that seeks to help resolve and explore these tensions in detail. While I share initial findings in response, the research is still in progress. As such, this early reporting of results seeks to put into focus, and explore in details tensions in the particular context of family making and in primary school classroom, use of game making as a creative medium and the affordances and limits of game making particular tools. -->

## Context
<!--
INTRO ON CHALLENGE OF TEACHING CODING
"The challenge to create tools and pedagogies to allow younger learners to start to engage with coding as a creative design practice is on-going ... "
 -->

<!-- On a global scale there have been many developments in software and programs researching game making.

- Constructionist researchers and programs.
- Value of Scratch for game making and associated research.
-  middle ground of commercial games which have a creative element to it. -->

The influential report "Next Gen: Transforming the UK into the worldâ€™s leading talent hub for the video games and visual effects industries" was focused on providing the UK games and animation industry with the talent needed to succeed [@livingstone_next_2011]. The top recommendations were to include computer science in core curriculum, introduce a new Computing GCSE (a general exam for 16 year olds before they progress to more specialised study) exam, offer bursaries for computing teachers and to implement well-supported use of games and visual animation in the school curriculum as a way to attract more young people to the subject. The After the Reboot report [@waite_pedagogy_2017], returned to the subject of game making as a way of increasing engagement in the process of coding. The review highlighted several areas of promise which needed more research: using games for engagement, use of design patterns - a term explored later in this chapter - and the involvement of girls in coding and social and cultural aspects of coding. The "After the Reboot" report also contained concerning observations. The report found that girls, ethnic minorities, and students of lower socio-economic status were all less likely to take computing as a subject at GCSE level. Game making aligns well with the principles of inclusive practices and project-based learning (PBL). It provides: learner choice in projects which increases motivation;
authentic and shareable project outcomes to encourage peer feedback and reflection;  iterative projects work supporting student mastery; and challenging goals and guidance in goal setting aiding self-regulation in learners.

A key grassroots group addressing issues of inclusion in UK computing is Computing at School Include which is a working group of teachers and researchers in the field.[^1] The CAS Include website includes resources created by the network and they hold regular in-person and online events. They promote an inclusive approach to programming by creating projects and using examples which are "real world and culturally relevant".[^2]  The following section examines the intersection of inclusion, a project approach and game making.

<!-- The benefits of game making aligns with those of wider creative computing projects. There has been extensive publication on computing education and techniques aimed to support teachers often new to the subject. These include a new website with materials, including quick guides and writing around a set of 12 computing principles.
A lot of this literature is aimed at helping teachers in a classroom context and with a focus of explaining and exploring computing context.
MORE ON THIS - OTHER TIPS FROM NCCE AND LINKS TO RESOURCES.
BUT NOT TOO MUCH
While projects are mentioned as a principle that allows learners to deepen their understanding on computing concepts by putting them into practice. There is less on specifics of how teachers can support project work or indeed how to best develop resources to support project work in schools. -->

## Game Making, Project Based Learning and Inclusion

Contemporary understandings of inclusion go beyond SEND (special educational needs and disabilities) issues to include cultural exclusion which may include dimensions of race, gender or other cultural factors. Recent studies study the use of games and playful techniques to overcome exclusion from the culture of computing [@kafai_diversifying_2017; @kafai_beyond_2014]. If students feel excluded from school culture then making bridges to home cultures is vital. One way to make those connections to home cultures is to allow for more choice of what can be incorporated into computing projects. The benefits of game making as a form of project-based learning (PBL) also align with a teaching framework focused on inclusion called Universal Design for Learning (UDL)[@basham_understanding_2013]. While an analysis of the synergies between PBL and UDL is beyond the remit of this chapter, key characteristics of game making as an educational activity align well with both UDL and project-based approaches. The following sections give three examples.


## Inclusion and Inclusive Pedagogies

The term inclusion in education no longer addresses solely children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) but also examines barriers of culture and other exclusionary elements of the school environment and discourse [@black-hawkins_achievement_2008]. The issue of alienation from the culture of computing in schools has been identified as an issue of concern especially for girls and some ethnic minorities [@the_royal_society_after_2017]. To be inclusive schools and teachers must identify both traditional SEND issues and wider cultural barriers to participation in computing classrooms and help student overcome them. Beyond the important technical accessibility tools and assistive learning technologies - for example text in different sizes, screen readers - a diversity for inclusive teaching strategies are also needed.


<!-- The next section deals with inclusive
Web-based or software activities include game making, meme creation, hobby website creation or making storytelling adventures. Incorporating materials from narrative forms like books, films, games and social media content into computing projects increases the ability for learners to bring their own interests into the mix. However, while the range of materials and possible creative projects is exciting and full for promise for computing teachers, it is not always clear how to best approach these opportunities from an educational point of view. This chapter will explore teaching and learning approaches to increase learner engagement with computing, firstly by defining and exploring concrete approaches, and then by sharing useful classroom tactics.
 pedagogy but Florian and BH make a distinction with other similar terms does this need to be explored?  -->

<!-- Researchers Black-Hawkins and Florian [-@black-hawkins_classroom_2012] note that many teachers report lacking the knowledge to effectively teach children with SEND issues.  -->

One way to address SEND issues is to use differentiation to adapt a the standard lesson plan for learners needing special support. However this view of a standard, optimal learner pathway is not supported by recent research in neurodiversity, which suggests there is no one optimal way for students to learn. Inclusive pedagogies take a different approach to differentiation which places more power in the hands of learners to choose the path that is most appropriate for them. All students are given a greater choice of materials and activities from the start suiting the varied needs of all students. This has the benefit of removing stigmatisation of some learners having to undertake work that seen to be created for _low-achieving_ students. These principles - among others - are presented in a framework called Universal Design for Learning (UDL).


 <!-- easily be time-consuming, and overwhelming.

Modern inclusive pedagogies advocate design learning experiences to benefit the participation and achievement of all students.

This approach is inline with recent understandings of neurodiversity. One instruction method is unlikely to work for all learners.  -->


<!-- Make the above paragraph clearer - perhaps find citation -->
<!-- (Good citation or example needed?)
- first part of inclusion is here
However, many of the principles of the UDL framework will be  ones that experienced teachers have already adopted based on their intuition and experience. One key approach is that of introducing concepts by starting with examples that are physical and familiar and then drawing out the more abstract ideas that can be applied in other areas.
- then a section on UDL Later
- finally Conclusion makes claims to favour leading without concepts - concrete fading

### Key Concept - Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

UDL is a set of design principles aimed at educators to help them design learning experiences that incorporate diverse ways to engage pupils and to represent the concepts being communicated. The UDL framework  provides guidelines for three key areas of representation, expression and engagement and action [@cast_about_nodate]. You can use the following summary of UDL principles as a checklist to help you to plan inclusive teaching activities. A more comprehensive outline is provided by CAST organisation.[^1]

**Multiple means of representation:** Are you presenting material and concepts in multiple formats? For example, spoken presentations, written documents, graphics, hands on activities, audio material. Are you clarifying new language and symbols in diverse ways? Are you providing important background knowledge and highlighting important patterns and relationships in the knowledge you explore?

**Multiple means of engagement:** Have you been able to increase student choice and the relevance of your material to spark learners excitement? Are you using a variety of ways to allow your learners to focus on their goals, maintain self-belief and sustain their effort as individuals and in group work?

**Multiple means of expression /action:**  No one particular action or format of expression will be best for all students. Are you able to offer a choice in how your students interact with materials and tools (particularly assistive technologies), allow students choice in the media they use for communication and construction? How much are students able to set their own learning goals and monitor their own progress?

<!-- Rather than designing separate activities and support for learners with different educational needs in the classroom - often labelled accommodations for disability - UDL facilitates learners to choose a learning pathway that suits their individual abilities and learning strategies. -->

UDL places great value on the personal relevance, choice and authenticity of learning experiences. As a way to encourage engagement UDL suggests setting choices of concrete learning goals that are relevant to the learners. This learner-led approach is very different to a traditional-instruction based, directive approach to teaching. The diverse learning pathways offered can be unfamiliar for both teachers and for students. The UDL guidelines recognise this and provide information to support teachers to implement them. As educators, we may need to build our own abilities and familiarity with learner-led approaches as well as growing the autonomy of our students.  

<!-- Students can then be supported in the discovery and recording of the underlying concepts after undertaking activities. -->
<!-- ### Case Study - Exploring Universal Design for Learning in Context -->
One area of UDL that teachers can implement straightforwardly is to represent concepts in the classroom in a diversity of ways. In a related study, researchers Cook and colleagues [@cook_using_2016] explored the alignment of UDL with another framework, CRA, which consists of a three stage model to support learners to develop concepts [@fyfe_concreteness_2014]. The researchers outline how the three stages of CRA (Concrete, Representational and Abstract) align with key UDL principles, most specifically multiple ways to represent knowledge to aid learner perception and comprehension. In short, first teachers introduce a physical, concrete model of the concept, then progress to iconic forms, for example graphics or pictures; finally learners work with more abstract models of the concept. The CRA framework is an example of concept popular in Mathematics research and practice called Concreteness Fading where concepts are introduced in concrete examples and then learners are supported to understand and represent them in more abstract ways.

When reading about different approaches to teaching computing the terms concrete and abstract are used commonly. For example the concrete practice of coding is a good way for learners to work with more abstract computing concepts. The following section explores the utility of these terms to explore inclusive approaches to teaching especially in relation to an understanding of Computational Thinking.


## Overview of my interest and experience in this domain

- DIY music and protest event organisation
- Participatory media making for social and environmental causes
- Documentation writing using collaborative processes
- Creative coding

In summary, as a Computer teacher candidate I was drawn to the possibilities offered by a new technologies and the shifts in computer pedagogy. In the reality of schools that I taught in working within the constraints of the curriculum, exams and competing pressures for time worked together to prevent the kind of authentic activities that first attracted me.

However, a new position as a project work for EdLab allowed me the ability to explore this outside of the classroom in more innovative programs and partnerships.

- Hive Manchester and Code Club
- Coder Dojo
- Creative coding at Manchester Libraries
- Speciality training for PGCE and Primary Education programmes
- Home education workshop in Manchester Met in partnership with students as part of Edlab and other PBL courses.
