## Personal Motivations

## Social Motivations

- more general / social / 21st C, computational fluency

Computational Fluency [@bers_coding_2021; @resnick_closing_2001; @resnick_fulfilling_2017]

## Community Approach to Game making

Foundation sociocultural approach which goes beyond a conception of transmission model of learning and embraces learning in context.

- Vygotsky (and friends) - foundational ideas - activity as unit of analysis
- Wertsch and Cole - community and context as vital in studies, role of cultural mediation in development @cole_beyond_1996-1 .
- Rogoff - community of learners and 3 foci as a way to frame this in education

<!--
// don't focus in on DBR save that... -->

### Activity as Unit of Analysis

Quickly rephrase from a Rogoff chapter. Keep it snappy.

### Cultural Mediation

The vital role of cultural mediation in development @cole_beyond_1996-1

This clearly aligns with digital making. Find citation.


### Application to Community Learning
Keywords - Communities of Practice, Situated learning & legitimate peripheral participation.

### Guided participation Rogoff and Communities of Learners

<!-- Perhaps don't get into 3 planes yet save that for more detailed analysis -->

(Continue to) refute or problematise  dichotomy of learner led, teacher led approaches @mascolo_beyond_2009.

Participation on community activities as a valid approach.

Cultural and social factors are vital to development process even if hidden in as school setting.
Guided participation as a middle ground between instruction and discovery.

Teachers benefit from the concept of scaffolding, and designing learning environments and interventions to support learners to enter into a pattern of activity.

This has been applied in various forms, PBL, apprenticeship models, for example have guided participation as a base via different forms of scaffolding.


## Summary of Digital Making Studies from a Sociocultural Perspective

As such, to help answer RQ1 & 2, this literature review now turns to explore game making and digital making studies which explore social and community planes either explicitly or implicitly.

The focus on historical and cultural artefacts and practices brought by Rogoff, and in particular the concept of guided participation was originated in non-school settings and younger age ranges.  

However, the concept has been used to analyse participation in non-formal and formal settings.
The following studies are relevant:

- guided participation framed in media literacy @aarsand_appropriation_2016.
-

### Formal, non-formal and informal.

This distinction is not just about a school or non-school environment [@erstad_identity_2012].

While some researchers define formal learning as that which happens in school and informal learning as that outside of school (Gerber et al., 2001), others (Eshach, 2007, p. 173; Werquin, 2009) would describe an intervention like the one in this study -- where learning happens outside of formal institution and where there is little instruction but the learner experience is carefully planned -- using the term 'non-formal' in contrast to both formal and unstructured/informal learning. Sefton-Green (2004) complicates this view, noting that informal learning can take place in formal settings and vice-versa. Given this inconsistency, my study will use research and relevant literature to create working definitions of such terms. Research exploring home game playing and digital activity uncovers material that families may bring into a non-formal game making process; I will draw on work on participatory culture (Jenkins, 2009), affinity spaces (Gee, 2004a) and naturalistic studies of digital use and creativity in the home (It≈ç et al., 2010; Livingstone et al., 2018). Gee's (2004b) work on games and associated culture as learning experiences is founded on his understanding of how they engender a shared discourse and emerging identities . My study will be guided by understandings of how home discourses or 'funds of knowledge' (Moje et al., 2004; Moll et al., 1992, p. 3) can be drawn on as a resource by participants to facilitate learning in new environments.


### Family Making
Roque's work is founded on sociocultural / situated understandings of learning and brings it into a non-formal learning environment. A key question she asks is how can facilitators help develop participation in community activities [@roqueBecomingFacilitatorsCreative2018].
I extend this in this study, how can the learning design contribute?


### Funds of Knowledge

COPIED AND PASTED BUT USE AS BASE - IF NOT INCLUDED IN INTRO
The concept of Funds of Knowledge emerged from research within United States Latino communities. The term addresses the use of knowledge and skills from participation in activities outside school that teachers can build on to help classroom work and to support the motivation of learners. Researchers found that Latino home cultures, skills and traditions were hardly visible in mainstream school cultures. This resulted in a form of deficit thinking about the performance of these communities [@moll_funds_1992]. Research by the UK National Literacy Trust [-@picton_video_2020] of 11-16 year olds found that 96% percent of boys and 65.2% of girls play video games. This study shows that while there remains a disparity between genders, game playing is still very widespread and young people are unlikely to be part of a household where no games are played.

Game making allows children to draw on funds of knowledge in various ways, perhaps in the choice of the kind of game that is to be made, in the setting or subject matter or the style and aesthetics of audio and visual elements of the game. Teachers can also draw out attitudes and knowledge of game cultures and bring them into the learning environment in an inclusive way. In addition, knowledge of game design conventions can be used by teachers to exemplify coding concepts. For example, consider conditional coding constructs. If Pac-Man touches a ghost, then a player life is lost. Such structures are described as a game design patterns. Werner and colleagues [-@denner_using_2014] found that the use of design patterns and game mechanics when teaching novice coders can increase accessibility for learners due the concrete and relatable approach.


#### Retro Gaming as a Fund of knowledge

- What is retro gaming? [Nostalgia in Retro Game Design.]
- Why is it powerful in affect?
- What potential does that give to family game making?

#### Design Patterns


Design patterns are most commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing but they are also useful for all levels of learners. Design patterns are rooted in real-life incidences of problems that are often solved in a particular way. They are concrete examples of coding principles in context.

##### Game and gameplay design patterns

The term game design patterns (GDP) is used in different ways. It can be used to describe the kind of code programming patterns that are used to structure code and keep it architecturally neat thus facilitating code sharing and extension. These patterns would be invisible to the end player of the game. The term also describes common patterns of game play and design that are visible to the player. Indeed players may become very familiar with these GDPs as they build their literacy as players about what they like or dislike about game they play. The results of this chapter focus on the second interpretation of GDPs. Eriksson and colleagues [-@eriksson_using_2019] use the second interpretation rephrasing slightly as gameplay design patterns, thus placing emphasis on the exposure to the user via playing the game. They described the utility of games design patterns as a _lingua franca_ for game developers. Other benefits cited are GDP as a source of creative inspiration and as an aid to problem-solving. Their research builds on related research which complied a list of GDP patterns as a public collection (available at http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/) [@bjork_patterns_2005].

In my own game making model students picked missions from a choice of printed resources. There were four colour themed categories of missions. _Game mechanics_ are features to do with the actions of the game. _Game space_ patterns address the layout of the game. _Game polish_ patterns involve adding music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements. Finally _System and Challenge_ patterns look at how different elements interact to create challenge in the game. An example of a game mechanic design pattern follows.

#### Link paragraph to game making pedagogies


## On game making pedagogies

There is a lot of similarity of game making pedagogies and that of digital making and broader study of media literacy. This section attempts to stay focused on game making where possible but widens domain if relevant to the questions of community approaches.

- UMC / Remixing  - Half-baked games
- Design approaches - designing for an audience
- Broader definition of CT, computational fluency / computational participation.
- Physical methods, feedback, from constructionism
- Design patterns in Agent sheets
- Game jam, space, mechanics, rules, etc .

### UMC and Half-Baked Games

The 'Use-Modify-Create' approach proposed by Lee and colleagues 2011) is particularly promising to counter issue of user anxiety surrounding the difficulty of coding games. It comes from the desire to be able to integrate game making and robotics to support computational thinking and draws upon grounded game making studies Denner et al., 2014, 2012; Werner et al., 2014, 2013).

The model advocates the remixing of existing games to act as a scaffold to build the competence of the beginner coder. Learners are guided to progress in the complexity of their modifications, thus becoming increasing proficient in the recognition and use of computational concepts and structures Lee et al., 2011). The concept of 'half-baked' games, which are incomplete or somehow deficient in a way which motivates learners to delve into the code and improve them offers a possible enchancement to the 'Use-Modify-Create' model Kynigos, 2007; Kynigos and Yiannoutsou, 2018). The focus of half-baked games is to design them in a way which encourages malleability of the code in directions that the learner may find interesting. Thus the original game designer makes complex decisions which highlight certain affordances of the game in a way which encourages the exploration of key concepts, in this case computational thinking. Kynigos and Yiannoutsou identify a progression in the type of CT skills being used as the processing of modifying the game progresses as part of the Use-Modify-Create model moving from elements like pattern recognition associated with reading of code to ones like a creating abstracted structures and sequencing their own algorithms. Kynigos also highlights the possibilities of half-baked artefacts to build learner dialogue around the problems at hand as as 'a communicational tool to shape a common language within the community' 2007, p. 336). Elements of learning designs to support dialogue are explored in a later section of this writing.

### Design Patterns and Games

Design patterns are most commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing but they are also useful for all levels of learners. Design patterns are rooted in real-life incidences of problems that are often solved in a particular way. They are concrete examples of coding principles in context. Design patterns can help the development of coding communities if more experiences coders take the time to document the patterns they use in an accessible way for novice coders. For educators the use of design patterns can help support learners develop coding proficiency by providing scaffolding and modelling good design decisions. However, one of the challenges for teachers of using worked examples and design patterns is how to integrate them into student-led design challenges.

The prescriptive and categorisable nature of CT would seem to suit rigorous assessment. y Werner and Denner built an ambitious assessment elements into a two year programme using Alice to make games. They built a software tool to quantify the levels of computational thinking, using a structure of thinking algorithmically, the use of design patterns and then combination of those patterns into large game mechanics Werner et al., 2014, 2012). This mirrors work done to automatically analyse Scratch project to assess levels of Computational Thinking Hoover et al., 2016). Here by contrast, analysis is undertaken using framework of use of computer language syntax and data types rather than game mechanic concepts and other code pattern usage.

The concept of computational design patterns is well explored in the professional literature of computer programming and design Gamma et al., 1995), and has also been adopted by game designers Bjork and Holopainen, 2005). Design patterns are well thought out solutions to common issues faced by computer programmers and system designers. Research in this area points to challenges of teaching the abstract nature of traditionally shared design patterns related to object oriented coding languages but points to visual methods and games as promising tactics Azimullah et al., 2020; da Cruz Silva et al., 2019) .

My own findings are inspired by the work of Repenning and Basawapatna 2010) on computational thinking patterns (CTPs) as part of their Scalable Game Design (SGD) programme. We can compare CTPs with design patterns. The kind of CTPs identified in this study are less abstract than the object-oriented design patterns offered by Gamma and colleagues 1995); however a similar guiding principle exists. Both concepts of patterns can be identified by participants through their familiarity with software as users. Patterns are also shared within communities of established and novice designers as a way of saving time, encouraging code reuse and developing a shared vocabulary of concepts that enriches computational practice of the community participants.

It is the familiarity and understandability which which drew the SCG researchers towards a pattern-based approach. They cite the contested nature of computational thinking National Academy of Sciences on Computational Thinking, 2010), and highlight the utility in more specific learning outcomes compared to more abstract interpretations of computational thinking. Their solution driven by their interactions with teachers is to foreground concepts that have potential to transfer to the area of science simulations Basawapatna et al., 2011). It it valuable to examine the specifics of the Computational Thinking Patterns (CPTs) in relation to the context, aims and tools of the Scalable Game Design programme. Example patterns are shown in the following diagram which is part of the assessment of individuals taking part in the programme.

New journal Article - Gameplay design patterns as a lingua franca [@erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019a].
<!-- Could move some of this to the results discussion -

"
- Problem-Solving for Game Interaction Design: Patterns can contain various potential solutions for designers which have identified problems with specific interaction parts a game concept.
- Inspiration: Pattern collections embed gameplay concepts found useful in other games, and can therefore serve as a knowledge source for new game designs or redesigns of existing ones.
- Structured Design Tool: Both by enumerating concepts as individual patterns and by providing relations between patterns, a pattern collection can help designers to work through different levels of abstraction in a design in a structured fashion.
- Communication: The patterns offer the possibility to describe the design in a standardized format to make the understanding and comparison of different designs easier. This can be designers communicating with other designers but can also be participants discussing with other participants. The offering of a standardized format for concepts can potentially also increase the likelihood of members of heterogeneous groups being able to see each other as peers since they can communicate in a common way." -->
