## Overview of Game Making Pedagogies

Game making pedagogies refer to the educational approaches and methods used to teach students how to design and create games. These pedagogies are based on the idea that game making can be an engaging and effective way to learn, as it provides students with opportunities to apply their knowledge and skills in meaningful and creative ways.

One approach to game making pedagogy is to use a project-based learning approach, where students work together to design and create their own game. This allows students to explore their interests, develop their creative and technical skills, and work collaboratively with others. Additionally, project-based learning can help to foster problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and communication skills, as students must work together to overcome challenges and complete their project.

Another approach to game making pedagogy is to incorporate game design principles and elements into the curriculum. For example, students can learn about game mechanics, such as rules, objectives, and challenges, as well as game design elements, such as graphics, sound, and animation. By learning about these elements, students can gain a deeper understanding of the design process and develop the skills they need to create their own games.

Game making pedagogy can also be used to teach a range of subjects, including mathematics, science, and language arts. For example, students can learn about math concepts, such as probability and statistics, by creating games that incorporate these concepts. Similarly, students can learn about science concepts, such as the laws of motion and energy, by designing games that simulate these concepts.

Finally, game making pedagogy can be used to develop digital literacy skills, such as coding and computer programming. By designing and creating their own games, students can learn how to write code, create animations, and develop interactive experiences. This can help students to develop the skills they need to succeed in the digital world and prepare them for careers in technology and digital media.

## Guiding Concepts and Terms

### Learner Agency

Learner agency is a term used in education to describe the extent to which learners have control over their own learning and can make decisions about what, when, and how they learn. It is an important concept as it recognizes that learners are not passive recipients of knowledge, but active participants in their own learning process. Learner agency gives individuals the power to direct their own learning journey and make decisions that shape their education and future.

Learner agency encompasses several key aspects of the learning process, including motivation, self-directed learning, and autonomy. A learner with high agency is motivated to learn and takes an active role in the learning process, seeking out resources and opportunities to gain new knowledge and skills. They are also able to direct their own learning and make decisions about what they want to learn and how they want to learn it, rather than being solely guided by the teacher or curriculum.

One way to develop learner agency is to create a learning environment that is supportive and empowering. This includes giving learners access to a variety of resources and opportunities, such as hands-on experiences, project-based learning, and opportunities to explore their interests. Teachers can also help foster learner agency by allowing students to take an active role in the learning process, such as setting their own goals, choosing their own learning methods, and reflecting on their progress.

### Learning coding from the perspective of Activity Theory

Activity theory is a framework that is used to analyse and understand the nature of human activity and how it contributes to learning and development. The theory views activity as a complex, holistic, and culturally-embedded phenomenon that is shaped by a variety of social, cultural, and historical factors.

In the context of learning code, activity theory provides a useful perspective on the process of learning to program. According to activity theory, learning is not simply a matter of acquiring new knowledge and skills, but rather is a process of transforming existing practices and cultural tools. This means that in order for individuals to learn to code, they need to engage in meaningful and relevant activities that are connected to the cultural practices and tools of the programming community.

In practice, this means that learners need to be involved in a supportive community of coders and developers, who can provide guidance, feedback, and mentorship as they develop their skills. It also means that learning activities need to be designed in a way that is connected to real-world projects and problems, rather than simply teaching abstract concepts in isolation.

One key aspect of activity theory that is particularly relevant for learning to code is the concept of "expansive learning." This refers to the idea that learning is not just a matter of acquiring new skills, but also a process of transforming and expanding the individual's existing practices and cultural tools. For example, as learners engage in coding activities and projects, they are not only learning new programming concepts and syntax, but they are also expanding their understanding of the cultural practices and norms of the programming community.

### Constructionist Approaches
Constructionist approaches are a learning theory that emphasizes the hands-on creation and collaboration of meaningful projects in a social context. This approach to learning, popularized by Seymour Papert, is rooted in the belief that people learn best by actively constructing knowledge and understanding through experiences and reflection.

In a constructionist learning environment, students engage in creative and collaborative activities such as designing and building prototypes, writing code, and creating digital media. Through these activities, students develop computational thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and a deeper understanding of complex concepts. The focus is not solely on learning the technical skills, but rather on how those skills can be used to solve real-world problems and create meaningful projects.

Constructionist approaches are particularly effective for learning programming and coding because they provide a hands-on, interactive, and exploratory experience for students. Instead of simply being taught programming concepts and syntax, students are encouraged to experiment with different programming languages and platforms, modify existing code, and create their own programs and games. This helps them to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of programming and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

Furthermore, the social and collaborative aspect of constructionist approaches is critical to their success. By working in teams, students can build on each other's ideas, share their knowledge, and learn from each other. This fosters a supportive and encouraging environment that helps to demystify complex technical concepts and overcome obstacles.

### Game Design Patterns

Game design patterns are reusable templates or solutions that are used to solve common design problems in game development. These patterns provide a structure and a language for designers to communicate their ideas and solutions to each other, and they can help guide the design process and make it more efficient. Some of the most common game design patterns include mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics patterns.

Mechanics patterns describe the core rules and systems that govern gameplay. For example, a mechanic pattern might describe how players collect and use resources in a game, or how they progress through levels and challenges. Mechanics patterns are the building blocks of game design, and they provide a foundation for the rest of the design process.

Dynamics patterns describe the relationships and interactions between mechanics, and how they create emergent behaviours and challenges for players. For example, a dynamics pattern might describe how players compete or cooperate with each other, or how they encounter and overcome obstacles in a game. Dynamics patterns help to shape the overall experience of a game and make it more engaging and dynamic.

Aesthetics patterns describe the emotional, sensory, and narrative elements of a game that contribute to its overall style and feel. For example, an aesthetics pattern might describe how a game uses music and sound effects to create a specific atmosphere, or how it presents a story and characters to players. Aesthetics patterns play a crucial role in shaping the player's experience and making a game memorable and enjoyable.

### Game Design Patterns as a way to learn Game Making

Game Design Patterns provide a useful framework for novice game developers to learn game making and programming. They offer a common language and structure for designing and creating games, making it easier for new programmers to understand and implement complex game mechanics. By studying and applying game design patterns, novice game developers can learn the fundamental concepts of game development, including game mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics, and use these concepts to create their own games.

One of the advantages of using game design patterns is that they provide a set of reusable templates that can be adapted and customized to meet the needs of different games. For example, a novice game developer can use a pattern for collecting resources in a game and modify it to create a unique game mechanic that is tailored to the specific needs of their game. This allows novice game developers to quickly create engaging and well-designed games without having to start from scratch.

Another advantage of game design patterns is that they can help novice game developers understand the design process and make it more efficient. By using game design patterns, novice game developers can focus on the creative and technical aspects of game development, and avoid spending time on repetitive tasks and implementing basic mechanics. This allows them to concentrate on developing innovative and unique games that are engaging and enjoyable for players.

## Game Making Pedagogies and Tools

Additionally, remixing games may require a deeper understanding of game development, which may not be feasible for some novice coders.



### The "Use, Modify, Create" (UMC) approach

The "Use, Modify, Create" (UMC) approach is a pedagogical approach to teaching coding that emphasizes hands-on learning through experimentation and exploration. The UMC approach is based on the idea that the best way for students to learn coding is by actively engaging with it, rather than simply being lectured on its concepts. This approach encourages students to start with existing code, games, and programs, and then modify and build upon them to create their own unique creations.

UMC is often used in computer science and technology education as a way to engage students in the learning process and provide them with meaningful, hands-on experiences. For example, students may start by modifying an existing game or program, such as changing the colours, adding new features, or altering the gameplay mechanics. This process of modification allows students to develop a deeper understanding of how the code works, as well as build their own skills and confidence as coders.

Once students have gained experience through modification, they are then encouraged to create their own games and programs from scratch. This often involves working in small groups or teams, which fosters collaboration and encourages students to share ideas and support each other in the creation process. Through this hands-on, experiential learning approach, students are able to apply what they have learned and develop a deeper understanding of coding concepts and techniques.

UMC is also used in game design and development education, as a way to foster creative thinking and innovation. By allowing students to modify and create their own games, they are given the opportunity to express their unique ideas and perspectives, and to develop a personal connection to the content they are learning.

## Game Making Communities

### Leveraging Funds on Knowledge to create Game Making communities

The concept of "funds of knowledge" refers to the array of skills, knowledge, and resources that exist within a community. This can include practical skills such as cooking or carpentry, as well as cultural traditions and values that shape a community's identity. Developing communities using these funds of knowledge can be an effective way to empower communities and build social capital.

One of the key ways that funds of knowledge can be leveraged is by creating opportunities for community members to share their skills and knowledge with others. This can take the form of classes or workshops, where community members can teach others what they know. This can create a sense of pride and ownership in the community, as people recognize the value of what they have to offer. Additionally, this type of sharing can foster a sense of community as people come together to learn and grow.

Developing communities for young learners using funds of knowledge can be a valuable approach for creating inclusive and empowering learning environments. This approach recognizes that young learners bring a wealth of skills, knowledge, and resources to the learning process, and seeks to tap into these funds of knowledge to create a more meaningful and engaging learning experience.

One of the key ways that funds of knowledge can be leveraged in the development of communities for young learners is in the development of communities for young learners is to incorporate real-world, hands-on learning experiences into the curriculum. For example, if a community has a strong tradition of farming, this could be used to create gardening or agriculture projects for students. Similarly, if a community has a strong tradition of crafting, this could be incorporated into art or design projects for students. These hands-on learning experiences can provide students with a sense of purpose and relevance, as they are able to see how the skills and knowledge they are learning can be applied in the real world.
