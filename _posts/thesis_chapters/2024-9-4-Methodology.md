# Methodology

## Introduction

This chapter builds on the theoretical concepts explored in the previous chapter to expain how they are put into practice using a specific methodology. Here I cover the use of video recordings, participant interviews, and analysis of observational journal entries and resulting learning resources to achieve the systemic analysis previously outlined as typical of activity theory and CHAT-aligned design based reasearch (DBR).

To do this, this chapter describes:

- an overview of the design stages of the study
- data gathering and processing
- data analysis explored in stages
- comments on data validity, replicability and ethical considerations
- analysis of broad AT system (MOVE?)

### Additional context for this introduction


<!-- My own research in game making is an experimental approach to create a new learning design. I have worked with young learners, local families and undergraduate student helpers to evolve a game making design. A key driver of my research was to explore the potential to draw on family experience in learning activities by working with families to make games together. -->


### How Research Questions Evolved  

The process was driven by the activity of collaborative game making driven by practicalities, and my interests as explored in the first chapter.

As justified by DBR and formative interventions, the process was driven by a meeting of context and the needs / interests of myself as a researcher.

Possible themes that had potential but which were disguarded included;

- Computation thinking & systems thinking
- Aligning with Project based learning

Themes emerging include the alternation of abstract and concrete as a suggested learning journey, explored in my journal. However this seems to be explored in research on semantic waves with studies of more breadth so it did not seem a good idea to follow that thread in my thesis.

There was something about the formalisation of this process into graph form which put me off. I also realised that the frameworks that I spent a while trying to make accessible and gameful in the design, grouping and theming of their presentation, had strong similarities to concepts of abstract curriculum if explored through a semantic waves lens. Curriculum seemed too well a well trod path for a PhD thesis.  

Instead the community elements of the learning experience regained focus during the process of coding. There were particularly interesting elements of the learning environment which contributed to notable behaviours.

The area of in-depth study of learning and wider behaviours in the development of coding. Work on roles by Barron  and developed by Roque showed promise identifying helpful roles and reflecting them back to participants. Such reflection sessions were not always replicable with a general home education group or other non-formal setting.  Could this implemented in the design, in the way reflective techniques were implemented in to games. Thus making it more playful/ gameful.

### What research questions are answered by what data gathering and analysis - and described in what chapter?

1.  What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to game coding and design?
2. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?
3. How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?


**RQ1**

- Both barriers and tools / processes are explored in the literature review
- Interviews with practitioners in chapter 4 guided the design in broad principles.
- Barriers are explored in chapter 4 on evolution of the design
- Tools and processes in results chapters 5 and 6.

**RQ2**

- Interviews with participants some informal and some formal instructed directly adaptations to design
- Analysis of video data


**RQ3**

- Interviews with participants some informal and some formal instructed directly adaptations to design
- Analysis of video data



### JUSTIFICATION OF THE METHODS APPROACH

The value of participant input to intervention-based research in the domain of technology use is well explored via participatory research  [@iversen_computational_2018-1; @iivari_critical_2017], design-based approaches [@papavlasopoulou_exploring_2019; @barab_design-based_2004] and formative interventions [@cole_fifth_2006; @blunden_formative_2023]. In line with these research perspectives, the development of the tools and processes used by participants in this study emerged in response to my analysis of participant experience and their direct feedback. This process is particularly evident in the evolution of the learning design and resources. The trialling of the coding environment and starting templated occurred in various informal settings, over the course of two years and with input and concrete additions from parent volunteers, graduate trainee-teacher students, undergraduate students helpers University colleagues and with more indirect ongoing feedback from participating young people and their guardians.

While a full description of how this happened is beyond the remit of this chapter, this external input served several functions including: access to novel technical approaches proposed by parents and university volunteers; the surfacing of systemic conflicts hidden from my initial perception stemming from my pre-conceptions; observation of participant conflicts spurred the introduction of new tools to support development; and parental proficiency in adapting the learning environment to supporting their children leading to community-wide innovations in practice. My role as a facilitator included recognising and supporting the emergence of a repertoire of varied emergent practices in the responses of participants, and then to support these practices with suitable tools and resources. In this way, I support participants to build agency in their transformation of learning process.



### Justification of data collection and selection

#### Alignment with with socio cultural approach

The methodology of the data collection and analysis process is informed by socio-cultural approaches. If found the work of Rogoff in particular to research community oriented processes particularly illuminating

The process is a suitable approach for informal education.

As previously explored, the research questions invite a broad spectrum of analysis - cultural and social factors.

<!-- The depth justifies smaller data size and depth of analysis. -->

Here I adopt a naturalistic (is this the right word) research approach involves gathering data in situ to find and describe patterns of behaviour.

Large amounts of video data were being gathered, a challenge which is explored later in this chapter

Turning attention to the gathering and analysis of other data, such a rich set of data, will allow the cross referencing of the many sources.

While diversity of data invites drawing on diverse methods of analysis (3 planes, DBR approaches), ATs provide a foundation for the analysis of these diverse data.




## Summary of phases and resources of the study


The following overview of activity use by phase briefly details the evolution of tools and processes. Later sections of chapter explore the rationale for their selection or production.

#### D1: Initial research and development - August and September 2017

From PhD proposal games for a read write world.

* Phaser
* Thimble

Before engaging with families in P1 in August 2017 I followed tutorials on Mozilla's developer community website on writing games in javascript. I had used Mozilla's Thimble code playground tool in earlier work teaching javascript, a snapshot of which is available as PGCE dissertation [@chesterman_webmaking_2015]. I discovered I could use  Thimble, to house a working javascript based game. Mozilla promoted a professional, open source, javascript library for web game making called Phaser.js. At this time I also evaluated several online pixel graphics editors and chose Piskelapp.com.

#### P1: A phase of exploratory, co-creative game making - October 2017 to March 2018  

<!-- NOTE - The evolution involves phases and then tension - what and how to cover both?  -->
<!-- This phase took place before the official start of this research and relevant ethics application. As such,  -->


**Participants started with no set plan or toolset and were asked to plan and make a game in two larger groups of 5-6 participants of mixed ages. After several weeks, a minimal incomplete starting game code template was introduced in response to student need.**


Phase one was an extended, exploratory series of game making sessions over several months. This stage was aimed not at collecting user data rather than building my  competency as a facilitator. The process began with no pre-existing supporting materials. Several weeks in to the processes, I adapted a starting code template of a platform game and created various code examples to add functionality requested by participants. This template was adapted from an online tutorial to create a game of the _platformer_ genre  (see glossary), a move which helped to limit expectations of the technical complexity of their game. At the end of this stage participants showcased their games to students in the foyer of the MMU Brooks building.


**Tools used:** Phaser javascript library; Thimble code playground; online graphics editor Piskel; a varied set of other graphical and audio asset creation tools.


#### D2: Development Stage - May 2018 to December 2018

One-off workshops at Mozilla, Feral Vector and Manchester libraries events and to PGCE computer students helped focus and the creation of a “half baked” game template and supporting online and printable resources.

<!-- The requirements of this compressed time frame aligned with feedback to prompt me to design an accelerated process to bump start the game-production process. -->

<!-- The first phase of delivery in late 2018 was based on initial research stage; I drew on literature to identify factors to consider when designing for collaboration, adopting a project based approach inspired by design thinking.  -->
<!-- To inculcate parents and children in to the culture of retro video games I began initial sessions by inviting participants to older arcade games on laptops. -->
<!-- Game filled laptops.  
Should this be added to the table above

<!-- The tools allow participants to create games using a combination of a free to use online tools.

The use and design characteristics of the starting point of a half-baked game.

- Phaser 2 to avoid complexity of code structure
- 2D platformer - familiar to most - Mario and Sonic
- low-spec graphics
- game of player, platforms, and coins to collect and hazards to avoid.
- graphical level design
- key variables brought to the top
- simple structure of code in terms of aligning with framework and not adding extra functions


**Variable editing effective movement**

Player movement was a key to playtesting feedback as such three  key variables were highlighted at the very start of the game code and given descriptive names to facilitate their editing. When testing the game, the player's jump height was not great enough to allow progression up from the floor to one of the platform thus thwarting the collection of items.

Game progression require altering at least one of the descriptively names variables associated with jump height and then activating a preview window to observer the changes by playing the game in a new browser tab.
<!--FIND  Some evidence of building proficiency with significant work to change these three   

    // Variables that change how the player moves
    var gravity = 500;
    var velocity_x = 100;
    var velocity_y = 300;

While some participants engaged with extensive experimentation to find a player movement feel that seemed just right, others were much less concerted with this aspect of game play, lowering gravity drastically to allow a greater jump size but a more frustrating floaty jump.

**Level design and prototyping**

The starting**Glitch Game Club**
First iteration of game making course of 5-6 weeks. The template and resources created in the previous stage were used as a starting point but continued to evolve.
**Tools:**

Image 4.x above show a printable _quick start_ cards to aid participants to begin the process of changing level design.

As preThe possibility of disturbing the syntax of the  of code in the array. When participant did this it provided a good opportunity for facilitators or parents to outline the importance of correct syntax of and to explain the code structure.

The vignette in the last chapter saw Toby's adding new levels to his  game and undertaking many iterations of changes to the level design. He and several other participants spent extensive time performing level design activity with a goal of making the game extremely challenging but still technically possible. Others played with the convention of the game by removing all hazards and filling the screen with rewards/coins (an example is outlined in the starting vignette of the next chapter).

**Incomplete graphical blocks & Piskel**

The use of blank, coloured blocks of 32 x 32 pixels encouraged participants to change the graphical design and the relatively small size of the sprites encouraged rapid design.

PERHAPS REPLACE THIS WITH SCREEN SHOT OF PISKEL AS A TOOL
![](./Pictures/whale_1.png){width=50%}

The process of creating a pixel art characters and hazard involved using an online grid design tool called Piskel, creating an design of an appropriate size, saving, exporting as an image, downloading to the hard drive of the laptop in use and finally uploading and incorporating the image into the code project and linking using   code syntax.

#### P2: Accelerated game making programme  - 5 weeks in January to February 2019

**Glitch Game Club**
First iteration of game making course of 5-6 weeks. The template and resources created in the previous stage were used as a starting point but continued to evolve.


**Tools used:** Phaser; Glitch code playground replaces Thimble, Piskel; a starter game template; quick start cards; step-by-step tutorials; code snippet examples.  


By the beginning of P2 most of the resources and activities were in place and relatively stable. There were some incremental evolutions in the template that stemmed from participant feedback and my reflections. Key additions at this stage to support the use of a template were a collection of tutorials and code examples illustrating key game features that had been requested by participants. The collection of game patterns were presented in a web page together with the starting template and a link to an online book collecting the process into step-by-step chapter based tutorials. The resources are explored in more depth in sections three and four below. A more complete description of the resources used in P2 and P3 are included in appendix 4.x.The experimental team consisted of Home Educating families . Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly.

Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.

#### P3: Adding a process drama to the game making programme: 5 weeks in May 2019


P3 used the same toolset as P2 however in addition, drew on my previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department [@caldwell_drama_2019] to create a simple drama process to give an external motivation and narrative to the creation of games using for a fictional audience of visiting aliens. The participant activity of these stages and tensions between system elements are discussed in detail in the remainder of this chapter and in following chapters.

**Tools used:** As per P2; a drama scenario; side missions; a code project to interact with aliens using markdown code.   

#### P4: Adapting resources to MakeCode Arcade and more formal settings - November 2019 to September 2020

In 2019 MakeCode Arcade was launched to make games using for novice coders via the use of a block coding systems similar to Scratch. I adapted resources with an aim that they could be used within secondary classrooms to support computing curriculum. To do this I added a learning dimensions map, a process which is explored in a later section of this chapter. I ran two iterations of game making course using MakeCode Arcade. The facilitation techniques and approach were adapted from those of P2 to facilitate the use of the block coding language [^1]. Tool use at this stage is also explored in a chapter in a collection on K-12 computing education [@chesterman_game_2023].

I also adapted and advanced resources with an aim that they could be used within secondary classrooms to support computing curriculum. To do this I added a learning dimensions map, a process which is explored in chapter.

**Tools used:** Make Code Arcade (MCA) tool; MCA Template starting game; MCA quick start cards; MCA game pattern menu; MCA game pattern tutorials ; Learning Dimensions Map.  

Include footnote to online resources.

<!-- At this stage of writing I include a bullet point list of design relevant features to be expanded later.

- Shared repositories of resources - users shared a log in so they could see the work created by others.
- Showcase: At the end of the game making process students asked strangers to play their game in the foyer of my departmental building
- Drama Games: the process of warming up, creates community and sets a tone
- Drama Process: specifically designed ot  overcome limits of the classroom.
- Playtesting: the process of playtesting, either self or peer links back to a community purpose

### Challenges of data collection and processing

While the rich set of data invites the cross referencing of the many sources, it also presents challenge on how to deal effectively with the large amounts of data being gathered. The use of a 360 camera reduces the amount of live video footage of interactions needed. Instead of multiple cameras pointed in different directions to capture participant interaction, participants are arranged in a square pointing inwards towards a central 360 degree camera.

<!-- I use a software sustainability approach also influenced by a personal modification of permaculture computing ideas and ideas of free software and open document approaches. The very nature of working with video is time consuming. -->
<!-- There is sometimes a danger of imagining how a new data gathering tool could be useful but then not being aware of all of the potential pitfalls which can make processing the data time consuming. Also  -->
<!-- On a personal note, I sometimes like the challenges involved and sometimes find them infuriating. It can be like a specialist knowledge which you can use as a currency, or as a hidden knowledge that you take pride in sharing. -->

<!-- I use a software sustainability approach also influenced by a personal modification of permaculture computing ideas and ideas of free software and open document approaches.

- Data portability and interoperability
- Software sustainability, in particular longevity
- Licencing - FLOSS licence ?
- If proprietary - then what is the business model?
- Is batch processing of files possible?
- It it a cross platform approach - in particular can I use it on debian based linux systems?

I also take a more practical approach which takes into account working with peers and that such advocacy is not a core part of my job or this research.

Such an attitude may involve compromises or hacking systems, software or processes -->

#### 360 Video Processing

The processing of video and audio data of both captured screens and 360 video data and high quality audio data involved several stages yielding advantages in capturing the gestures and facial expressions of potentially all participants in one recording. It does however present challenges. While this merits further exploration a brief summary of challenges is presented here.

The process involves large video files that are easily corrupted in transfer. While the files are split into 8 minute segments  but also can be confusing
- time navigation - also confusing - sometimes put up on the screen - but inconsistently
- moving and keeping a track of data from week to week and over years is complex.
- processing data requires special software - from samsung
- viewing data on a normal vlc player - needs extra processing using spatial media

<!-- Tech details are logged here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6m20wehYkTeevj9QucpzKCR4NioELndg2rZeLWFK-c/edit# -->


This whole process is so demanding in terms of careful file management. Making me create a linux command line toolbox which is included as a technical appendix. [A draft of which is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y7MsZDY8ofvls5XO7tztSu8KFdClJo09o3qpWOdkb2M/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=11432580350275268987)


#### Screen Capture Processing

I chose the software flashback pro primarily as it was intalled on and availble at low cost on home computers. Flashback saves data in a format. This include audio, video screen capture, learner keystrokes, mouse movements and optionally one or more webcams. I decided not to record on webcams for the following reasons:

- intrusive feel - having the webcam on and the resulting red light on the screen, I felt was less conducive to feeling comfortable than one 360 camera in the middle of the room.
- less resources - recording webcam on the laptop
- reduced video file size of final data file
- less complexity when processing data -

It not possible to code the natively created files directly. Thus need to be converted to mp4 to import into coding software like Nvivo. In this process the keyboard and mouse data is lost.

<!-- Thus original files have been retained in order to cross reference that data if it is useful. It also presents other options for analysis which are similar to much more in depth analysis of HCI research of professional set ups. While this is beyond the remit of this study, certain uses do present themselves strongly for future investigation. Particularly the study of such data to identify common mistakes or frustrations when interacting with the user interface. Such misconceptions could be addressed in direct teaching at the start of the next session. -->



#### Learnings and recommendations on processing

The following learning and recommendations emerged from this process.

Prioritise displaying time - have an old school clock under the 360 camera. For example.

Check viability of data at each stage of processing and movement.


## Data Analysis


My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer, participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. I also record the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants.

One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour.

### Notes to allocate to a stage

#### Rational and approach of data analysis -


Video data analysis involved description and transcription of video data and thematic analysis of the contents.



<!-- The gathering of data and revision of teaching materials took place over several years. As such, there was time for extensive reflection and reconsideration of factors involved in the learning design in dialogue with existing literature on game making and game making communities. -->



Analysis was in different forms, and drew on additional forms of data gathering.

- Broad dipping into sessions via 360 video, advantages, focusing on community interactions, disadvantages of
- Transcription and annoation of video capture footage in parallel with 360 data
- Coding of sections of video to both emergent themes and themes relating to the reseearch questions.

NOTE - Import more from the post of 2024- 05 - 08 - in diary.


### Data Analysis Stage One


STAGE ONE
Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.

As outline in the table above, stage one involved initial broad analysis of the varied forms of data and recording observations in an excel sheet.


This data was analysed, at a broad scale,  using 3 planes of sociocultural activity. The existing relevant framework saves time, especially as a more emergent approach was  (in part ) in coding video data.

WHY NOT GROUNDED? OR TO WHAT EXTENT WAS IT GROUNDED? IN THE AREA OF INTERPERSONAL ACTIVITY.


#### 3 planes approach - noting tensions and behaviours

RQx addresses the formation of a game-making community. This process is co-constituted by planners, facilitators, parents and children.

Following the approach of Morcom [@morcom_scaffolding_2014] I drew on Rogoff's  [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of sociocultural activity used to help understand activity in a Community of Learners.

I created an excel spreadsheet and noted behaviour and tentions that emerged in transcription and coding.

This helped to get closer to the data and to :

  - start identify to  thematic analysis of the stages of design with other learning models like PBL
- to identify roles through repeated patterns of interactions, and contrast to Barron's work
- to reflect on the thesis questions


While the three planes provided a higher level framework, specifics of the data gave greater granularity and formed sub categories of coding used in the next stage of analysis.


<!-- Rather than taking a grounded approach this data was analysed using 3 planes of sociocultural activity. The existing relevant framework saves time, especially as a more emergent approach was  (in part ) in coding video data. -->

<!-- The process aligns with AT analysis in the scope of the activity - and in the separation out of the community level of the triangle added by Engestrom . -->




 - The advantages of drawing on funds of knowledge, and the activities that I used to do this, as well as connecting to wider communities are address well with the plane of culture, in the concept of Apprenticeship.


<!-- While more complex, the plane of more individual participatory appropriation, allows for alignment and then transfer to more formal learning environments. This then makes this research more relevant to class room and guided sessions. -->





### Use of journal data (in stage one)

STAGE ONE
My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music.

<!-- To be able to effectively analyse these diverse sources, I will need to prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes. I explore some of the emerging themes and criteria for selection which incidents to explore in depth in the results section below. -->

The process of analysis of journal notes and resulting resources required a different approach from that of video data.

The following resources were examined

- Book Journal pages
- Digital journal entries directly in response to teaching sessions


<!-- - Linear support book and print outs to support participants in sessions
- Additional 3M model resources to help navigation and reflection and gameful approaches -->

Journal Notes were used in the following ways: (perhaps code this)

- as a reflective tool after sessions
- as a note pad to plan resource creation
- as a sketch pad to explore the relationship between Concepts being explored and existing game making frameworks
- as a

The quantity of data prevented extensive and detailed coding using thematic analysis.

Instead, observations are triangulated with data from lit review to expose key themes and tensions.

My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use and other relevant interests.


<!-- AT allows an exploration these diverse sources of information as mediating artefacts which are the enabler and product of the shifting goals and outcomes of the programmes participants. -->

<!-- A key strategy of AT used to locate learning happening in an environment, is via the identification of contradictions between different elements of the activity systems and subsequent study of how these contradictions are resolved (Engeström and Sannino, 2010). I plan to use my journal and participant interviews to identify key moments of contradictions and resolution to study in greater detail using the range of data available. I am also inspired by the work of Oliver and Pelletier (2006)who employed contradictions between systemic elements to create a coding scheme used to interpret video data in a study on game based learning. -->



### Data Analysis Stage Two

Schema for initial thematic analysis in stage two  was informed by literature review, early analysis of journal entries and  emerging observations of data in stage one


#### Partial transcription/description of data

The partial transcription of video data formed a significant part of the data analysis. The large amount of video data recorded forced a prioritisation of data to be transcribed. It also forced a partial transcription process which was in part descriptive and in other parts involved a closer transcription of the words spoken by participants.

To aid the process of coding, I broke up analysis of  in 5 minute sections.

This limited the accuracy of the process. In part, this element of the research was limited by the practicalities of working with this amount of data.

I priorised more data as this was needed to get a greater scope of activity to allow analysis of wider community activity.


**Justification of selecting sessions and sections for more detailed analysis**

Then deciding on 8-10 video sessions warranting full coding of activity.
This was based on the following factors, quality of recording, how much activity, richness of interactions, a range of diffent kinds of participant interactions.


Criteria  for inclusion included both practical and theoretical considerations.

- Good quality recording
- Diversity of kinds of participants, ages especially
- Diversity of participant actions in terms of tasks being worked on
- Diversity of kinds of pair and peer interactions


A page of quick analysis of the files online here helped to shape that decision on what sections

#### Initial, coding of video at stage 2


Thematic analysis is commonly done in stages, each revision building on insights of the previous one.

While sstage one surfaced themes, stage two created a coding structure in nvido

Summary of thematic analysis - https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/uploads/production/document/path/18/18247/Kiger_and_Varpio__2020__Thematic_analysis_of_qualitative_data_AMEE_Guide_No_131.pdf

Video coded in segments in Nivivo - Stage 2
In this level, the rough coding involved by breaking up video timescales into 5 minute sections lessens the ability to make exact claims however for this study it opens up lines of initial questioning which can be explored in future studies or triangulated with other data in this study.


Describing different grades and pass overs of the video data.

- quick analysis
- sections coded and described in 5 minute chunks
- themes of interest identified - in relation to evolving RQs  -  to create evolving drafts of the emerging themes

#### What was considered but then  excluded from initial coding and why

The following themes  emerge as potential learning outcomes in the learning model, and were observed in interactions in stage one

- Elements of Computational Thinking
- Systems Thinking Concepts
- Design cycle stages
- Types of Gameplay Design Patterns

CT   was not included at stage 2 as there is other extensive or focused work in these fields (previously explored in the literature review) on CT which this study which this study does not need to replicate.

Systems thinking was promising but not a proposed part of the learning design, and the data in P2 and P3 which became a chief focus of thus study was not as rich in this area as later P4 data.  

#### Coding Design Cycle Stages

PERHAPS DROP OR AT LEAST REALLY EDIT DOWN
HOW MUCH IS IN LR?

<!-- There are similar stage based approaches to creating a digital project. Firstly project based learning (PBL), then Inquiry based learning, finally design thinking. This design could adopt any one of these, however the creation of a digital product more closely resembles a design approach with testing stages of the created product. -->

<!-- The design process characteristics are broadly as follows; the process is often iterative, involves evaluation and separates planning from implementation. -->

In Chapter 2, the potential of iterative design thinking as scaffolding approach was surfaced. I was interested in the promise of this.

It is possible to be more specific when coding and include a wider terminology of technology and domain specific language. For example, debugging in the area of computer programming and playtesting in the domain of game making. I have had to weigh up the value of including these more specific terms and deciding to keep a more generic approach primarily to reduce complexity while undertaking video coding. Sub-categories add complexity and time to the process without necessarity adding a great deal.  
ADD IN A JUSTIFICATION BASED ON HOW RESULTS PAN OUT.

IS THIS STILL EXPLORED IN CH.4 - COULD IT MOVE HERE?
I was interested in the question what could  coding based on the different game elements that are being added to the game serves to illustrate. The process of learning game making through deepening your knowledge of game elements is explored by Schell [-@schell_art_2008]. As way of coding initially I considered the MDA framework (mechanics, aesthetics, dynamics) due to the focus on the user experience being taken into account.



This distinction was helpful in preparing resources as a navigational framework, as explored in chapters four and five.
In that process I adapted the MDA framework to slimplify and match common features that had been suggested by participants. Four categories resulted: game mechanics,  game space, game polish (aesthetics), game challenge (dynamics).

This categorisation prompted  a line of questioning, would the application of different kinds of patterns, yield different results.

It did not yield particularly interesting insights. However, in coding I noted the use of the game design patterns as mediational strategies which proved to me much more fruitful. Thus I began to list the different mediational strategies that involved GDPs and this evolved into one of the main coding theme.

<!-- ##### Coding Game Design Patterns

NOTE THIS IS NOT REALLY USED IN DATA - thus make minimal - OR MOVE - IN DESIGN? PROBABLY JUST REFERENCE REALLY BRIEFLY AND PICK UP IN DESIGN

OR DROP TOTALLY! eg.

### Final coding scheme (but this is stage 4)

#### Coding Participant Roles and Interactions.

Evolving notes on coding of roles and interactions are in an online document here.

Excel doc -    https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit

Roles are different from interactions existing on a higher order of anaysis. Repeated patterns of interactions can be seen to develop into roles. Thus a more grounded approach may concentrate initially on interactions and develop this to become roles through analysis. However, many roles exist in other similar domains.

For example, the work of my own staring point when coding was guided by Barron and colleagues work on the roles of parents as learning partners [-@barron_parents_2009]. The roles are as follows: Teacher, Collaborator, Learning Broker, Resource Provider, Nontechnical Consultant, Employer, and Learner.

when coding I started with some preset codes from the literature for examples Barron's codes on parent roles when helping digital projects. However, as coding progressed, I modified and extended these codes to better match the data I was working with

Specifically, the following were removed from Barron's typology, parent as employer, non-technical consultant. Learning broker and resource provider were merged as some of the detail of those roles involve take place outside of the learning environment being analysed in coded video.

 I judged it appropriate to and less complex to analyse and code the interaction between participants rather than code the behaviours by participant type.

#### Selection of vignettes for deeper analysis

- Full transcription of key moments: and description of participant activity, activity on screen including simple gesture analysis

Used in chapters to orient the reader


**Incorporating  movement around the room in analysis**

The 360 camera allowed for side by side analyis of the group, pair or individual working. Due to the layout these were cluster often around a laptop.

In the initial stages of transcription and description having this data was extremely useful to disambiguate spoken statements.

As a personal experience of describing and transcribing even thought it was a significant amount of work to synchronise and then to play both video sources side by side, the additional information really aided the description process in adding detail to the interpretations of motivations of participants.  

For an example see the vignette in appendix 6.x (Suzanna and Olivia) chapter 6 which details the movement and behaviours of the child away from the computer as an example of legitimate peripheral activity.



**Simple gesture analysis**

In some exchanges, 360 data was vital to explain spoken word.

This helped clarify some things that were unclear from audio and screen capture data.


For example, deictic referencing, where unclear statements were clafied with pointing or other gestures was common. Such gesture were used often  to clarify game movements on screen, or in one case a software procedure of cropping an image.



#### Analysis of the evolution of the programme resources created

There were two main types of resources created.

- supporting teaching / facilitation RESOURCES
- games and game and assets created

The documentation and other forms of support evolved during each phase -

I did not try to collect any personal notes that participants used for planning. And this was minimal for many participants.

Chapter four explores the evolution of these resources using AT as a tool for analysis of the existing and emerging contradictions in activity.

### Data Analysis Stage Three

After drafts of the emerging themes were in place, these were sued to create a revised coding structure and data was recoded more systematically. .

**Integrate the thoughts here**
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6m20wehYkTeevj9QucpzKCR4NioELndg2rZeLWFK-c/edit#bookmark=id.k9kvu0182p6u

STAGE 3 - In the final stage, previous transcripts with notes were  imported data into nvivo and coded each of the 5 minute sections to the final thematic analysis.

#### A revised processes of thematic analysis

What was really needed - Prioritising the selection of data and quick reading of it in nvivo

Complexities - thus rejecting comparative approach.


After data analysis in stage one. The following revisions were made in overall schema of coding.

While useful, I dropping design stages as a schema, for justification and implications see discussion in chapter six.



The wider helping interactions, again while useful had drawbacks. Firsly, they were so numerous. Secondly, given the existing work of a general scope of digital making by Barron, it was not clear what I would add in terms of contribution to knowledge beyond broadly confirming it in the scope of digital game making.

Instead, an area that was more targetted emerged from these areas.

 <!-- The analysis of these resources using the three planes involved a choice of some of the following
- using a spread sheet and putting categories and notes in to columns
- using a table in word to record notes on data in-situ -->

<!-- The video data explored in nvivo is very time consuming, and given this and the factor that the transforming reflections into  learning resources, already involves a process of filtering, a much courser level of data analysis. -->

<!-- However, using a static text only approach such as describing data in prose or using a table in a word document does not allow for filtering based on themes which is potentially useful as an analytical too.   -->

<!-- Thus using MS Excel as a simple way to collate data without translation seems appropriate. -->

##### Coding use of GDPs as mediational strategies
This is explored in chapter 5

##### Coding impact on design/ processes on learner agency - boiled down -

<!-- NOTE  I would say no - too complex for coding  -->

REMOVED AS PROPOSAL BUT INSTEAD HOW TO ADDRESS THIS?

FIND ANOTHER FRAMEWORK FOR AGENCY AND CODE TO THAT.

Answering RQ - on pedagogical resources / agency / use of GDPs

THIS IMAGINED FOR CONCLUSION BUT ALSO CODE TO IT? OR ABOVE?

- learners developing agency through personal expression of home and other Identities
- agency through choice over pathway via GDPS
- agency through flexible design cycle pathways, especially via community playtesting
- developing agency through celebration of different game maker styles
- authenticity of tool use, especially docs and access to Community
- authenticity of audience - and role of drama to facilitate reflection





#### On Final Transcription/description of data

At this stage coding schemes were more mature.

- Partial transcription of more video files -


The coding of each extract via a selction was the process. To better aid analysis via Nvivo selections

MORE TO COME HERE



### Use of Interview data

Practitioner data used to inform themse for dvideo ANALYSIS

Participant interview data mostly used to confirm and triangulate with video data from making sessions

#### Practitioner  interviews

Four practitioner interviews were a rich source of thinking to help develop and deepen my reflection on key issues, to develop lines of thinking and to expose and explore barriers to participation in projects, tactics to address them and tensions experienced by practitioners and participants in similar creative coding projects.

The interviews were semi-structured allowing me to ask follow up questions to gain more detail on areas of interest.  

The chosen interviewees represented a certain diversity in audience however as these interview are limited in number, resulting data are also explore in relation to existing research and no broad claims are made from this data alone.

#### Participant interviews

These interviews took place at the end of between P3 and P4.

At times the resources that the

These interviews allowed triangulation and confirmation of data observered in video recordings.

**Limitations in interview data**

MOVE TO CONCLUSION
In retrospect, shorter interviews at more regular intervals with participants would have been useful to answer


## Data validity, replicability and reliability and decisions of what to not analyse


<!-- NOTE - MOVE THIS? DOESN'T SEEM TO FLOW IN THIS SECTION -->


### Data Validity - Triangulation of Data - THE THEORY

Draw on other chapters to represent overcoming of weaknesses of design-based approach.

Having a wide based on data allowed data triangulation
e.g.  find a dood example of finding confirmation in interview data


#### Limits of / problems with video data analysis

The choice of the videos to code more fully is rather skewed towards finding interesting data. Thus it may not be fully representative of the experience of all participants.

Choosing in a different way - around less interaction - would expose more barriers to participation to game making using the 3M model.
<!-- For example in
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQf0OvKs07tY-VKDnB7K94F_kHVW7M1Vz0NlLm1t1WE/edit
Imagining a constructionist game-based pedagogical model: Using tabletop role-playing game creation to enhance literature education in high school English classes -->

Only suitable pairs were chosen. This removes a lot of validity from any generalisation of claims that could be made.

Breaking of data into 5 min sections is practical but does not allow for some of the finer interactions and changes of behaviour to be accurately coded.  There may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granular detail.

<!-- The game elements / design patterns categories which are presented are created as a design guide rather than on exact principles.
It is possible to code drilling down into another level. This might yield more results. -->

In summary, the coding process is more valuable as a tool to allow more qualitative reflection and analysis rather than a quantitative process as attempted above.

To make a quantitative approach work better X,Y and Z would need to be in place which was not suitable for this study because of A and B.


<!-- How much emphasis to place on the Thematic Analysis is questionable. The process served to help answer the research questions in general way as an additional interpretive tools to aid researcher reflection and to help get close to the data. -->

<!-- I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies [@derry_conducting_2010]. I use a variant of discourse analysis to explore interactions of participants captured on video recordings. Mercer and colleagues identify discourse analysis as a loose associations of methods to support linguistic analysis of interactions to identify emergent patterns [@mercer_methods_2004]. While a common pattern in classroom interactions is that of IRF, initiation (teacher), response (student) and follow up (teacher) [@sinclair_towards_1975] , the inherent assumption that a teacher will be leading an activity will not consistently be appropriate for my study; although at times a parent may take this role. Other discourse analysis frameworks that take a sociocultural approach [@lyle_investigation_1993; @phillips_beyond_1985], and specifically those from project focused studies [@hmelo-silver_facilitating_2008; @moje_maestro_2001] allow more detailed treatment of the incorporation of tools and cultural artefacts into a collective discourse. -->

<!-- To avoid distraction from AT as my principle analytical framework I am in agreement with Wells (1999, p. 172) who proposes the use of AT's concepts to situate 'spoken discourse \... as one, but only one, of the semiotic tools that participants use to achieve the goals of action'. Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals. -->






### Discussion on evolving coding process - PERHAPS SHIFT TO LAST CHAPTER finally

The process of trying to decide a main focus was often tricky.

Take for example the process of Da in 2019-05-08 - where he was leading some fairly advanced work on researching and reading developer documentation and the constructing a new design pattern.

There are competing and overlapping intention and foci here for the participants.
 - Solve immediate problem - add new pattern
 - communicate cultural practice of finding, reading and adapting developer level documentation and help from forums.
 - give hands on experience to the notice coder

Most clearly there is an overlap here between the interpersonal working on a code problem collaboratively for educational purposes and the interactions with the wider cultural artefacts and practices from a professional environment.

Thus the process of writing this up was not neat.
To overcome this issue...

In addition the personal plane was perhaps the most problematic to address given the data gathered.
Even when participants were demonstrating their personal knowledge by sharing back or directly altering game code, this was as part of a social and cultural practice.
Thus my interpretation involved ....




### Generalisation of Research


#### Data Replicability

The elements of the design are online and included in appendices.

This study faces an issue of being culturally embodies, thus think descriptions of context are needed here [@hoadley_creating_2002].

The final chapter addresses the need to replicate this study in different contexts and the challenges involved in replicating the spontaneous emergent elements of specifics of this study.

As such chapter four can be conceptualised as a design narrative (see [@hoadley_creating_2002]) to address the common deficit of detail of the designed product and process. "the usual study presents a technology fully formed as if it had risen from the oceans like Venus herself"

" Would that all interventional research included this kind of rich description of the “treatment” so that one might infer whether the results were applicable elsewhere."

#### Generalisation of Research


Generalisation is one of the guiding principles of DBR. While results are intertwined with context, designs should be assessed for generalisation to other settings.

Explore this in more detail - draw out a debate on how situated learning in this context - and wider debate is.

- More than one iteration.
- In different settings
- Using different with different software

This is potentially complex to describe but worth it if wanting to talk about generalisation.

NOTE - This could be dropped or picked up again in the limitations section

The process of exploring this guided the development of the research questions.


#### Ethical and Practica issues impacting the formative intervention of this research - MOVED HERE CHECK

<!-- The design of the research experiment and learning I started from a very open position and has evolved from several iterations of collaborative work with participants. -->




**Practical factors**

Key contextual factors have facilitated and shaped development of the research design including:

- Impact of research practicalities
- The location at the university

<!-- Eliza effect? If so how relevant? -->

The availability of resources potentially  attractive to this audience.

For example, the ability to have that number of identical computers for this audience in particular drove participipation to be in a university setting.  

and using this shape of working which was determined by technical reasons but which had an impact nevertheless on the ability for students to move around the room and the absence of a front for the teacher to teach from.

Motivating or other effect of being part of a research project (Eliza) may be present. However, this study does not make comparative claims.

Generalisation is covered in this thesis.

<!-- In early stages of delivery I adopted an open project based approach. I will later describe how this evolved in to a template game using a javascript game making library and an online tool used for phases 1-4 which participants were invited to add to and alter.

The last iterations of the learning design adopted the MakeCode Arcade tool as a new game authoring tool. This block based programming environment reduced participant coding errors allowing a greater focus on game making concepts. -->






## Discussion on Methodology


### Discussion / Conclusion

NOTE - WHAT KIND OF DISCUSSION WOULD BE NEEDED HERE?
A RETURN TO POSSIBLE BARRIERS THAT THE METHODOLOGY AIMS TO OVER COME



### Authenticity - creating value

IS THIS NOT COVERED IN CHAPTER 3 - UNDER JUSTIFICATION OF APPROACH / THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK?

 Barab and colleagues discuss the importance of creating value in the world in their ecosystem approach [@barnett_ecosystem_2019].
 This mirrors authenticity in applied social approaches - PBL as applied method of - situated learning ontology.



### On the emergent and mutual nature of the design and research process


The experimental team consisted of Home Educating families . Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly.

STAGE ONE
Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.


**On potential of involvement of parents**


The presence of parents adds significant opportunities. I propose that this informal and exploratory setting with the participation of engaged parents, young people and their access to family learning dynamics and wider expertise provides potentially fertile ground in the generation of resources and domain practices. I explore the potential of this theme in more detail in the conclusion of this thesis.  





### How does this methodology relate to existing models of Change Laboratory & DBR and what does that add potentially

Keep this brief.

The smaller time frame of iterations, and more direct intervention in the ongoing / leading activity distiguishes this approach from a Change Laboratory. However, the analysis of tensions, and thus double stimulation to provoke evolutions of agency are alike.



The next chapter focuses in more depth of the mutual evolution of the learning design in a way which aligns with the design narative technique of DBR (hoadley? - find others!)

My role as a participant facilitator, designer and researcher
and how this interacts with
 the process of refining this reflection into learning and teaching resources which was complex and iterative. And to an extent intuative. This present issues of validity and replicability.





<!-- Barab and Squire [-@barab_design-based_2004] describe the messiness of design-based research and that this creates a challenge to the researcher of how to present results in a coherent way which is of use to other practitioners. There is a tension between sticking closely to the context of the research and the concrete specifics or stepping back to generalise and being lost in abstraction. Here, I try to strike a balance which stays concrete but which also pulls from my observations a framework which may translate in to other game-making and creative project based approaches.

Another guiding principle of design-based research - which is present in the techniques of design experiments, mutual appropriation and participatory action research - is that research participants also influence the ongoing design of the research [@barab_critical_2004; @cobb_design_2003; @downing-wilson_design_2011]. The design of the research experiment and learning I started from a very open position and has evolved from several iterations of collaborative work with participants. One experimental team consisted of Home Educating families another involved local primary schools with Year 6 (10-11 year old) classes. Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly. Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture. -->





<!-- I have carried out six phases of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline the core activities that have taken place including only the most basic detail on tools used. In following sections, the development of toolsets are analysed in greater depth. The core of the game making programme, which emerged in the first phase and has remained, is a starting template of a simple platform game which participants alter to make their own. The evolution of different versions and locations of this starting template has proven to be a key marker of the progress of the programme. The timeline of phases of activities is outlined in the following table.

<!-- Each section follows a pattern: the activity is described in general, then examples of activity at that scope from the vignette above are described, ending with brief analysis or signposting to where the activity in explored in greater depth. -->

<!-- The following descriptions mirror the work of AT researchers who conceptualise scope of activity as concentric circles from Broffennbrenner with "larger" scopes of cultural and societal goals and smaller, narrower, lower scopes of more personal activity [Engestrom][Cole]. -->

<!-- A short description of the activity systems follows the vignette above to help the reader establish a broad understanding of the processes involved before further analysis. I signpost the reader to other chapters when the described activity is explored in more detail there. -->

### Environmental factors and objectives

The context of the learning environment situated within wider systems of activity. Three key systems are represented in an illustration 4.x  below. The diagram is necessary simplification of contextual factors and objectives of interacting, focusing on research goals on the part of the researcher, learning computing skills and concepts as a home education project and finally a broad aim of fun on the part of the children participants. Diverse cultural and contextual factors from the original activity systems are played out in a new shared activity system, while there is a nominal shared objective to the main activity, it the community contains diverse actors with different agendas.


<!--
Other relevant objectives of re include: a desire to create a useful learning experience on the part of student helpers; participating with other home educators in a creative environment and thus building team and communication skills;. -->

<!-- NOTE MOVE PREVIOUS Chapter?  -->

The diagram is in line with Engestrom's concept of expansive learning via a shared object (explored in the chapter three) [@engestrom_expansive_2001]. In this research, I take the approach of treating this shared object as an activity system in its own right. Lecusay takes a similar approach [@lecusay_telementoring_2015] when describing an adaption to an after school program. He describes the shared object as an idiocultural hybrid which develops into its own activity system. The concept of idioculture is used in this study to deepen the description of the community dimension of 3GAT.

Following Barab's description of nested activity systems [-@barab_using_2002], this shared system, whose objective is to make a games for an audience to play,  can be seen not only as nested within the wider systems but also as a container for  other  activity systems nested with that. While this overall approach is considered valid [FIND OTHER SUPPORT], the danger of fragmenting activity to much is to make matters confusing. The job of the researcher is to prioritise systems to describe and analyse based on the area of study and the concerns of the participants. This prioritisation in AT is sometimes conceptualised as the process of finding a key units of analysis. In the process of research I have found two units of activity particularly illuminating, one being the shared activity system described above of making a game in a community process. The other, narrower in scope can be described as implementing individual game features. Beyond these key systems, I draw on the concepts of actions and operations within systems to describe tensions and contradictions which emerge in the research process [-@leontiev_activity_2009].

<!-- GDPs ( conceptualised here as game design patterns), which while often implemented on an individual or pair scope, were also fed back into community activity.  -->

There are diverse end audiences for the games. The final target audience are students and staff in the Manchester Met Brooks building where the created games are shared in arcade cabinets at the end of the programme. An additional audience are friends and family who can be send the games to play online. The more immediate audience for the evolving games are peer game makers during the making sessions.

![Carrot eater game with an self made arcade unit made from cardboard boxes](./Pictures/carroteater3.jpg){width=90%}

While the broad aim of making a game to share is agreed through participation, there are also diverse motivations stemming from environmental factors in the interrelated actors in this activity which feed into the contradictions which emerge at this level of activity.

#### Illustrative vignette on participants activity indicating general activity of participants


The purpose of this vignette is to illustrate some of the key features of the overall game making activity in relation to activity systems and relevant system elements. (included as an appendix of this chapter as Appendix 4.a -

<!--
[Link to online version here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vYeVxYaRMTWPDOHwC4DEGYAkGPRIDX7wLiz0l8b7LWc/edit)) -->

The participant, a child Toby, has been working independently on the design of a platform game for several minutes of the session. As a facilitator, I draw the participants attention to the showcasing of their games to an external audience to focus their attention on completion of their games. Toby pays close attention to the challenge and variety of the game playing experience for his imagined audience of players. During the course of the session Toby invites many other group members to play his game. He initiates and responds to conversations around the difficultly of the game he has designed. The more immediate audience of his peers is clearly important to him in guiding his actions.

He uses a variety of tools in the process of coding and testing his game including: a web based coding tool (code playground), a game template which he has used as the base of his game project and,  a menu of documentation linking to code examples and tutorials   

While this vignette shows that the participant has developed fluid use of both software tools and documentation and support sources, these are areas where significant contradictions emerged which shaped the path of the support given. Contradictions concerned with use of core tools and additional documentation and support are explored in two later sections of this chapter.

The later section of the vignette shows evidence of elements of an emerging idioculture of this group. A student helper shares a question -  "Is yours the one where level one is harder than level three?". This is indicative of some of the emerging playful approaches that younger participants in particular are taking to the overall process. This represents an example of the influence of the wider systems of play of on the shared idioculture of the game making community. The complexities of processes to create and to help resolve contradictions as this cultural domain of collective making are explored later in this chapter.


<!-- IS THIS NEEDED? While the programme had a shared objective of making a game, there were tensions brought by the cultural factors and other objectives imported from other activity systems. The third contradiction explored in this chapter explores those tensions (including? ....). -->


<!-- In the vignette of Toby's activity this wider objective is present in the facilitator orientation at the start which references this audience -  _the Monday after we can play our games and we can share them with students. We can make the students frustrated when they can’t beat our games_. At the end of the vignette text, one of the student helpers also imagines this audience playing the game of Toby.    -->
<!--
NOTE - More on large scope in AT terms? What is needed here? -->


### Activity system 2 -  Constructing a game feature by feature

Within the activity system of making a game, in analysis of video data and evolution of course resources from P2 onwards, I identified activity happening at an individual or pair work which emerged with distinctive characteristics.

Activity was driven by learners setting goals, requesting help and then implement code structures based around altering or adding new features to the game using tools available in the learning environment. Participants also worked on audio and graphical assets to achieve this  objective.

While is it possible, aligning with Levontev, to identify the implementation of features as actions within the wider activity, there is value in  treating of implementing each GDP as a sub-project or activity systems in its own right ( NOTE - or at least as as a key unit of analysis). Barab and colleagues justify smaller units in their study observing emerging practices in a technology rich learning environment [@barab_using_2002].

<!-- NOTE - THIS IS ANALYSIS  -WHERE TO PLACE IT?
By this stage, the process of collecting a user generated list of features and trying to respond to all of them as a facilitator had been abandoned as unrealistic. -->

<!-- NOTE - how much from p1-4 below to include? -->

<!-- In the example above Toby progresses from playtesting his own game to altering it. The code to change the layout of the platforms of the game is already included in the starting template. Thus is able add a new platform by making simple code changes. Toby retests the game immediately by clicking on the preview element of the code environment.  -->

<!-- However within that wider objective there may be a variety of goals depending on the participant. In this case Toby's goal is addresses the challenge and variety of the game playing experience. -->

<!-- Toby builds his competence in the process of comparing the own code to the code example to work out what code is new and relevant to the desired behaviour. -->

Game design patterns emerged as a shared object as described by Engestrom in []. The object of activity here is not only the code and game assets which participants are working on. In addition the emerging concept and group understanding of the game design pattern becomes a share understanding on a community level as playtesing, pair work and peer help happens.

![Illustration 4.x - Shared object of implementing GDP  ](./Pictures/At_dia_4_v1.png){width=95%}

Chapter five contains more detail on the emergence of game design patterns as shared concepts and the implications for activity in more depth.

<!-- DEVELOP THIS IDEA HERE OR MOVE IT TO DISCUSSION WITH SOME KIND OF SIGNPOSTING HERE. -->

Objectives at this level also vary between participants with some more straight-forward and others more tricky based on their making style. For example, beyond a purely utilitarian objective, a further objective in implementing a GDP, e.g. a new graphical element may be to increase a sense of personal identification with the game as an vehicle for personal expression.  

<!-- MOVE OR EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL

#### Illustrative use of tools to mediate activity shown in vignette 4.x

A description of the use of the diverse tool set used at this level of activity illustrated in vignette 4.x is helpful to situate later discussion in this chapter.  By this stage of the process, Toby is able to browse a collection of game design patterns and use diverse of tools, resources and processes. Participants developed preferred approaches and tool choices especially in accessing help when adding a new feature to their game. In the vignette 4.a I outline the two main sources of help at the level of adding a new feature to the game: "Here’s the tutorial and there’s the examples of code". In the course of the vignette above, Toby chose to access only a code example of the desired game behaviour. He did not, as some in the group were doing in this session, use the tutorial which provided more descriptive, step-by-step guidance. Other participants relied only on direct verbal help from myself or other participants (like Toby) to help them progress.

A later section of this chapter details the different supporting documentation guiding participation in game making practices. Chapter five then explores activity occurring at this scope in more detail with a greater focus on emerging concepts as tools.


<!-- While some game patterns were simple to add, e.g. altering the location of platforms, other more complicated features involved several stages and varied tools to implement. The next section describes these stages as discrete code and design structures. -->

<!-- NOTE - Other participants;s motivations - explored later? -->

<!-- Other participants were less proficient using this online resources and used printed out versions of documentation. -->

<!-- In the next section narrower actions still within this system are explored as discreet actions which combine to be come the activity of implementing a game pattern. -->

#### Operations and actions within the system - Implementing discrete code and design structures

<!-- For example, creating a new graphical element in a separate online pixel-art editor called Piskel, exporting and downloading it to the laptop, and uploading it to the glitch code playground and then making code changes in several parts of the code to initialise and implement new behaviour for this element. -->

Within the objective of adding or altering game features (also referred to as game design patterns here), implementing more complicated patterns involved several stages and varied tools. Using the terminology of Leontiev [-@leontiev_activity_2009], participants undertakes certain chains of processes in a fluid way that shows that actions had become operations (as explored in chapter three). In vignette 4.x, an example of such an operation is Toby's quick navigation between different areas of the game code, the game preview window and other sources of documentation. In contrast, some tasks are new to Toby and are performed more hesitantly. In the vignette's description, it can be observed that at times Toby is careful and hesitant, checking and rechecking the process of copying and pasting new code into his game from the code example of a design pattern he has chosen.

<!--NOTE As a facilitator of a community I aim to notice these transitions as I aim to use the proficiency of participants to help distribute the process of helping peers. -->

Identifying shifts in participant activity in terms of scope facilitates analysis of the complex and interwoven cultural, social and personal actions in a communities activity [@rogoff_observing_1995]. Above, Toby shifts between the wider activity of making a game and sharing it with peers and narrower actions implementing concrete code structures. This aspect is developed in chapter five.

In addition to these shifts in scope, analysis of community processes also involves transformation over time.  The next section offers a description of the evolution of tool use in different phases of the study with an aim to situate analysis of emerging tensions in the use of tools, resources and processes in the following section.


<!-- In this thesis, chapter six has a focus on cultural aspects of making a game together and chapter five explores social organisation around the activity of adding game design patterns chapter five.  -->

<!-- After inserting the code which adds a moving enemy to the game, Toby spends five minutes altering the variables involved to match his design and to create a level of challenge that he is happy with. -->

<!-- Toby makes quick progress. one factor here is willingness to make mistakes. There is a confidence here in undoing mistakes, commenting out new code to return to previous behaviour.

The trial and error approach also yields benefits, a mistake in the values edited creates an unexpected result of the enemy moving vertically instead of horizontally. Toby embraces this mistake and shares his account of this happy accident enthusiastically. -->

<!-- In the last chapter, we examined the use of Rogoff's 3 lenses of cultural, social and personal activity. We can see a broad alignment of these lenses and the scopes of the activity systems above.

This has utility to both researcher and learning designer. The observations of the following chapters are based on this approach of using lenses to focus in on relevant activity.

#### Applying activity theory to surface contradictions and design tensions experienced by participants and facilitator/s

The followings sections use a process of analysis of contradictions between system elements of the activity systems outlined above. The processes is a formative intervention (explored in chapter three) in that the surfacing of tensions due to changes in the learning design over time are examined. As noted in the introduction, this chapter explores t.
he following areas of contradictions: contradictions in the technical tool use of design, contradictions shaping the development of supporting documentation, contradictions to do with issues of identity and the cultural dimension of participation.

#### Why not use constructivism / constructionism

COMPRESS THIS - ALMOST DROP TOTALLY - NOTE THE GENERAL ALIGNMENT OF CONSTRUCTIONISM WITH DBR METHODS


Hay describes DBR thus "learning occurs within a context of use, learning is frequently collaborative, learning as authentic, learning as inquiry-based not transmission-based" [@hay_constructivism_2001] p. 3. Thus the broad claims are in alignment with wider socio cultural approaches.


Cobb [-@cobb_where_1994] identifies two broad schools of constructivism, one focusing more on individual cognitive processes which follows the work of Piaget and the other drawing on the academic lineage of Vygotsky which locates knowledge formation as a cultural activity.

NOTE - THERE IS IMPORTANT WORK HERE ON AUTENTICITY- and the potential tensions with agency - ie if authenticity is working a the elbows of professionals, students have less ownership over the process.  [@hay_constructivism_2001, p. 34]


**Constructionism as applied learning and design  theory**

Much of the foundational literature on game making names constructionism as a guiding theory  (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996).

Constructionism as a movement has done important work in creating design guidelines but much weaker as either an underlying theoretical or analytical framework.

Some PhD studies, many from MIT,  use it as a guiding theory [Roque]

It can be viewed as a design technique based on constructivist roots [@kynigos_constructionism]

Constructionism is also described as  a theory of learning by Noss [@noss2015reconstructing] rather than a methodology. -->
