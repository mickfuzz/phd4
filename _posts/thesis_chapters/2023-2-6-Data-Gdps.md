## Chapter introduction

<!-- The working title of this chapter is Missions which aligns with a strand of the 3M game making pedagogical model developed in the course of this study. -->

The purpose of this chapter is to explore how the data gathered informs thinking on two research questions of this study.  

- How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices by novices?
- How can the experience of fostering community focused digital game making practices inform wider practice in this area?

The working definition of game design patterns (GDPs) is explored in the literature review and enhanced in the design chapter is augmented with analysis of specific examples of their use by participants in practice. This chapter continues with a Vignette of parent child interaction in game making process. The vignette is used to introduce an overview of interactions of that pair generated from analysis of video data. The chapter then focuses on the use of game design patterns by participants in these interactions and then in reference to  cultural, interpersonal and personal planes of activity. Finally a discussion section explores implications and observations from these findings in relation to existing research and concepts.

<!-- DROP The activity of the focal pair is then compared to activity of other groupings and individuals. -->

<!-- The predominant analytical lens used in the chapter is that of interpersonal activity, specifically in the form of guided participation in this game making community .  -->

## Introduction to This Writing

In the previous chapters we will have looked at the research landscape to develop coding and design practices in line with social understandings of learning. In particular, the intentional development of a communities of designers and coders with an educational aims has been explored paying particular attention strategies that educators can use to aid these processes. While this piece of writing contains results, it also contains references to concepts and methodologies which will be included in other chapters in the final thesis. Other emerging chapters are online at - https://mickfuzz.github.io/phd4/thesis_chapters.html
OR just create hyperlinks.

To help the reader understand the data in this chapter the following notes on methods/ methodology are included.

- The study uses mixed methods in methodology. Informed by analysis of journal diary, notes, video data and interviews (Methodology)
<!-- - An evolving table of what data is used in what way to answer each RQ is coming but is not ready. (Methodology) -->
- The research design evolved as the game making program was underway based on feedback and reactions of the participants (supported precedent in design-based research) (Methodology)
- A long pilot course and development stage resulted in extensive support materials and activities which I have structured into a learning design called 3M (Methodology + see recent chapter on 3M model)
- A narrow data samples has been used for this study. This prioritises a greater depth of analysis on interactions over generalisation. This is justified in a section on data validity in Methdology chpater.  
- The concepts of resolving tensions within activity from Activity Theory are used to explore the evolution of the design of activities and resources. (Design results)
<!-- - Rather than Engestroms AT framework (Subject, Object, Instruments, Rules, Community, Division of Labour) the results chapters use Rogoff's 3 planes of analysis (Cultural, Interpersonal and Personal) -->
- Results chapters use Rogoff's 3 planes of analysis (Cultural, Interpersonal and Personal) which aligns well with AT (Methodology)
- Game making is based on remixing code from an existing incomplete game template (half-baked games & scratch community processes)
<!-- - A quick summary of how parts of the design address three planes [is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FIPn2dEB2aCKZi5z05j69cnHgpGNXFh1_SPV6h5l12g/edit?usp=sharing) -->

### Recap on Game Design Patterns -

NOTE - A QUICK RECAP OF TERMS FROM LIT REVIEW

Design patterns are most commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing but they are also useful for all levels of learners. Design patterns are rooted in real-life incidences of problems that are often solved in a particular way. They are concrete examples of coding principles in context.

The term Game Design Patterns (GDP) use used in different ways. It can be used to describe the kind of code programming patterns that are used to structure code and keep it architecturally neat thus facilitating code sharing and extension. These patterns would be invisible to the end player of the game. The term also describes common patterns of game play and design that are visible to the player. Indeed players may become very familiar with these GDPs as they build their literacy as players about what they like or dislike about game they play. The results of this chapter focus on the second interpretation of GDPs. Eriksson and colleagues [-@eriksson_using_2019] use the second interpretation rephrasing slightly as gameplay design patterns, thus placing emphasis on the exposure to the user via playing the game. They described the utility of games design patterns as a _lingua franca_ for game developers. Other benefits cited are GDP as a source of creative inspiration and as an aid to problem-solving. Their research builds on related research which complied a list of GDP patterns as a public collection (available at http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/) [@bjork_patterns_2005].

In my own game making model students picked missions from a choice of printed resources. There were four colour themed categories of missions. _Game mechanics_ are features to do with the actions of the game. _Game space_ patterns address the layout of the game. _Game polish_ patterns involve adding music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements. Finally _System and Challenge_ patterns look at how different elements interact to create challenge in the game. An example of a game mechanic design pattern follows.

PRINTED CARD TEXT BEGINS

Your mission is to apply the following pattern to your game. There are supporting step-by-step resources available if you need them. When you finish be sure to reflect on how adding this pattern helps your understanding of the computing concepts and similar patterns listed. This concludes your mission.  

* **Name of Game Design Pattern:** Jumping on Enemies to Zap them

* **Type Pattern:** Game Mechanic

* **Description:** If the player is descending from a jump when they touch the enemy the player is zapped and in this case disappears.

* **Need for Pattern:** Enemies create challenge and being able to jump on an enemy is a good way of clearing the area you want to explore.

* **Coding Concepts involved:** Arrays[^8], Change Listener[^9]

* **Links to other Computing Patterns:** Systems Dynamics[^10]

* **Related Game Patterns:** You'll need to have added the **Add Enemies** pattern to your game before you can add this one.

<!-- From Eriksson article - explore in more depth in Lit Review..

Could move some of this to the results discussion -
"- Problem-Solving for Game Interaction Design: Patterns can contain various potential solutions for designers which have identified problems with specific interaction parts a game concept.
- Inspiration: Pattern collections embed gameplay concepts found useful in other games, and can therefore serve as a knowledge source for new game designs or redesigns of existing ones.
- Structured Design Tool: Both by enumerating concepts as individual patterns and by providing relations between patterns, a pattern collection can help designers to work through different levels of abstraction in a design in a structured fashion.
- Communication: The patterns offer the possibility to describe the design in a standardized format to make the understanding and comparison of different designs easier. This can be designers communicating with other designers but can also be participants discussing with other participants. The offering of a standardized format for concepts can potentially also increase the likelihood of members of heterogeneous groups being able to see each other as peers since they can communicate in a common way." -->

For the previous five minutes the parent and child dyad have face a blockage of a glitch in the software which prevents their wider objective of adding game design pattern of adding keys and doors to their game. In short, in this pattern the users must collect a key and then navigate to a door to progress to the next level. The parent Sh has been trying many different things and changing things in the code while the child Th has been expressing boredom. In response, Sh has expressed frustration and irritation. Finally Sh suggest that Th asks facilitator for help to resolve the coding glitch.

#### Summary Commentary on Annotation and Content of Vignette

The vignette including some gesture analysis. This is explore in more detail in a chapter on Methodolgy.

This was particularly valuable in the Key Door Person interchange where meaning was not clear before looking at video.
In previous chapter on methodology we (will) have examined the coding scheme used to code specifics on interactions and participant behaviour and output.

The resulting coding structure is available online here.

### Descriptive Commentary on Vignette A
<!-- ## WAS Observations of use of Game Design Patterns in Vignette A -->

<!-- NOTE - COULD AT 3RD GEN TERMS - COMMUNITY, RULES ETC BE USED FOR THIS ACTIVITY SYSTEM IN THIS COMMENTARY - TRY IT?
BUT WHY NOT 3 PLANES - THAT MAY BE BEST FOR CONSISTENCY - TRY ONE -->
<!-- RESPONSE - It may be better even to compress this down and not use too much in the way of concpts.  

Perhaps just mention 3 foci at the end of this section?
NOTE - Commentary on replacing of level of analysis (confusing to some as hierachical ), with the term foci of analysis.

-->

In this section a summary of the interaction observed in the above vignette is described in broad strokes using the foci of cultural, interpersonal and personal activity [@rogoff_observing_1995-1]. More detailed interpretation and analyis of these interactions follow in later sections.  


<!-- Where appropriate I make observations on similar patterns of behaviour from the same pair from outside the scope of this interaction. -->

**Cultural Focus**

The parent has taken on the role of solving harder code problems following  instructions carefully. The child is one of the younger participants when blockages occur she explores the room or to dwell on the periphery of other participants interactions.

<!-- For both participants there is an explicit awareness of game making patterns and concept of the game as a dynamic system. Both seem to drive their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game. -->



<!--
NOTE MOVE
Another pattern the child advocates for is that of adding levels. This desire to add this pattern may have been picked up from the emerging culture of the group as this pattern has been added to other games and has become a topic of discourse.

The process of adding new levels is something that one participant Te has been teaching other children to do via peer support. He has added so many levels to his own game that children and parents in this session are commenting in on it. -->
<!-- For  Mi and Other Parent - "Have you seen Te's game it has 21 levels." -->
<!-- NOTE - CHECK THE GLITCHING / PLANNING TERMS WITH PREVIOUS CHAPTER -->

In the above interactions, there is cultural understanding of the conventions of a platformer game being shown by both the child and adult. Keys and Doors as desired a game design pattern appears to prompt engagement with the game making process. This is evident in the way with the child introduces and repeats the name of the pattern in a sing song voice in this interaction.

Understanding of the game as a dynamic system is seen clearly in the parent’s alarm at the child’s deletion of all elements of hazard. This interaction shows the parent guiding the child to imagine the user experience through the use of terms from GDPs. The parent uses GDPs as a prompt that they are designing for others. The child has also thought ahead to this time of playtesting. Both child and parent make reference to the imagined player experiences. In the vignette above Sh mentions "it's no fun if their are no hazards". The response of Th "It is for me." indicates a mischievous desire to play against game conventions with a desire to confuse or disorient players.
(my interpretation based on another extract explored later?)

<!--
Drop tool use here - not specifically GDPs
 One interaction with the facilitator uses the debugging tool of the browser. [Move?] -->


**Interpersonal Focus - Guided Participation**: Game making patterns are outlined by both the child and parent. They talk of adding more levels, of the mechanic of keys and doors in this vignette. After a blockage caused by debugging coding is removed, the parent immediately re-engages the child. The parent says "Did you see Th?" and then prompts the child to play-test the game. The child is keen to both replicate the GDP of keys and doors in the second level and to add a new GDP of adding additional levels to the game.  

The child shows high engagement at this stage outlining her plan for adding pattern to make progress in the process of designing their game. The transformation from the period of time when her parent was problem solving code is dramatic. For this pair this alternation between higher and lower engagement with the coding processes happening on screen was fairly consistent. The implementing a new GDP often involves adding new code to the game or a significant change in code which may need debugging. For this pair, larger coding activities were beyond the ability of the child.

MOVE THIS LATER - FIND A PLACE - CALL BACK TO IT
Feedback from the parent indicated this was partly due to reading ability. They also mention a strategy to address with this barrier to participation. "Th got on better during the coding once the student who was hovering initially left us alone.  Because every time Th hesitated, she jumped in to do it for her.  Whereas I know her better so can judge how to facilitate more minimally, and I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles.  Plus she can't read yet, so she was recognising the relevant bits of code by matching the individual letters, which takes longer."

MOVE THIS LATER - FIND A PLACE - CALL BACK TO IT
Two observations follow. Firstly, the design choice of a grid of letters representing different elements of the platform game appears appropriate in the case of a novice learning to code and read at the same time. Secondly, it is of value to explore during which design stages is the child is most active and engaged.


<!-- NOTE - MOVE TO ANOTHER SECTIONS WITH TRIANGULATION? -->
<!-- ### Gdp and motivation -->
<!-- I propose that a contributing factor to this motivation is the ability to replicate a familiar pattern of game play via her own work in construction. It is the ability to translate this home knowledge into her own artefact which gives a sense of mastery over an otherwise foreign environment. -->


**Personal Focus - Participatory Appropriation**

<!-- The process of personal development of knowledge is less clear from video data.
NOTE - SOME MORE READING ON AN INTERPRETATION OF THIS THAT I CAN WORK WITH FOR THIS DATA IS PERHAPS NEEDED. -->

Personal knowledge and practices are harder to observe in the video data of mostly pair interaction. However, following Rogoff's interpretation of this personal plane as participatory appropriation [@rogoff_observing_1995-1], knowledge or processes which individuals adopt, reuse and transform fits within this plane. Thus beyond solo activity demonstrating personal knowledge, expressions of personal knowledge or practices when they are shared back into the community activity are also valid here.

The child shows their personal knowledge of game design patterns in the end of course evaluation. She responded to the question _What would you like to see next time? What would you add?_ with the comment. "Th: I'd add a health bar and lots more levels and keep on changing the characters and background."

## Cultural, Interpersonal & Personal Planes Analysis of use of GDPs

In the first part of this chapter I focused in detail on the three planes of activity for one vignette. In this section I present the results of analysis of other video recordings as separate observations on the way GPDs are used by participants and facilitators to further their game making objectives. Acknowledging that these observation do not fall nearly into each of the three planes, I begin with those oriented more to cultural focus before progressing to  observations oriented chiefly to interpersonal activity and  then ending with some observation on GDPs impact on personal knowledge construction.

## Use of GDPs explored from a cultural focus

In the previous chapter the role of cultural activities to engage and sustain engagement in this game making programme were examined. This chapter allows us to focus in on the role that game design patterns in particular. Design patterns are by parents, children and facilitators as a tool of apprenticeship and personal expression in this emerging game making community.

### GDPs and the emergence of gameplay concepts and practices through Playtesting

<!--  NOTE - DROp? This section will explore the particular role of GDPs within the process of x
 using an example about one of the core GDP of the platform game, that of jumping. -->


#### Developing a language for the intangible - Evolving concepts of Game Challenge and Game Feel - PERHAPS MOVE TO LAST SECTION / PERSONAL

The discussion of game challenge, specifically comment about how 'hard' participant games were as the most common interaction during playtesting. The concept of difficulty for most of the participant's games was dependent on the interaction between the feel of the game controls and elements of game challenge associated with placement of hazards and moving enemies. The term _game feel_  has varied interpretation but is generally framed as the responsiveness and feeling of control over the main character during the core movement of the game. In this case, it effects the ability of players to move between platforms and avoid enemies.

In this design the jump mechanic is determined by the use of variables controlling gravity, jump velocity and movement velocity. The importance of these variables to is was behind the design decision to place these variable right at the top of the code and to rename them with player centric names rather than mathematical terms like velocity and acceleration.  
<!-- NOTE - BE SURE TO EXPLORE THIS IN SOME DETAIL IN DESIGN CHAPTER -->

The regular playtesting of games allowed participants to give each other feedback regularly and game feel was one of the aspects that young people in particular to gave frequent and valid feedback on.

#### Use of evolving language in informal feedback to direct modification of games

Parent Mi had been focused mostly on completing asset design. She had been made aware by her daughter Ne about  the relevant game variables. She had also asked for advice but Ne gave none leaving Mi to note "She's left me to my own devices." Player jump (y) velocity was set very high but left right (x) velocity was slow. This created a very frustrating game feel. The following is a compilation of feedback comments or reactions over a 15 minute time period.   

    Mi: (Talking to self) No! It's so hard that. (referring to a particular jump in her game.)
    Mick: How are you getting on Mi? It's looking good.
    Mick: (Noting frustrated air of Mi) Have you made it to hard.
    Mi: I don't know. Can you jump from here to here with this.. this.. him? (point to main character)
    Mick: So it look like you bump your head and fall down.
    Mick: One bit of friendly feedback that I would give you is that it's taking a long time to move left and right. And that is something that you can change if you want to.
    Mi: Oh right yeah.
    Mick: Yeah.
    Mi: Yeah, actually that's a good idea.
    Mick: If you think about average games. Your average jump time would be about one second in the air. So that can be a bit of guide sometimes.  

I share direct feedback about the frustratingly slow movement time and an indirect feedback on the high velocity jump value. I use quite indirect language when giving feedback and while I reference Mi's frustration rather than giving direct feedback.


Ch likes the look of the game and begins with that as a comment.

    Ch: That looks nice (referring to the graphical look of the game)
    Mi invites Ch to play as she can't progress due to the difficult game controls.

    Ch: It jumps super high but so slow  
    Pause.
    Mi: He has to go slow because he's an astronaut, you see.    

    Ch: It's hard.
    Ch then leaves

    Mi: (to peer parent with proud tone.) It's hard. Wow.

Fi comes to play the game

    Fi: How much jump speed to you have?
    Fi: Your jump speed is massive.

EXTEND
CONTINUES TO TALK ABOUT CROPPING IMAGE ANOTHER COMMUNITY PRACTICE


We can see that Mi justifies the game feel of a very high fast jump with a narrative response about the character being spaceman. However, the limited amount of time anyone plays her game and her own frustration in playing it is telling. The game feel is frustrating in the wrong way here. Mi seems to initially misconstrue the feedback she is getting here equating her ability to make the game hard as a positive thing. However, towards the end she notes the frustrating nature of the game. As a caveat, it is hard to be clear about the motives or decisions of Mi in this situation.

**Organically evolving norming practices being fed back to the community**

Other children come and play the game but only for less than a minute before leaving. While their feedback is non verbal the very short length of time that some of them spend is noteatble. While I haven't done the calculations the effect is clear. After the last one leaves Mi comments "It's so frustrating."

In these interactions we can see a consistent message coming from peers in the playtesting process. They praise the look of the game but offer constructive feedback to help improve the GDP of jumping. The same message is delivered in a variety of ways, above we can see feedback from Mick trying to bridge a technical and conversational approach, direct feedback of the personal challenge level and an interpretation of the cause from Ch and then a more specifically technical explanation with an offer of help made in return, perhaps as a gesture of no hard feelings after the critique of the game (my speculation).

The emergence of a community norm comes from the personal experiences of the participants.

This indirect comments aimed to direct direction of design mirrors some of the informal norming behaviours that are less directive seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues [find work]. ( NOTE EXPLORE THIS PREVIOUSLY?)

#### Other examples of emerging concepts / practices
These kind of feedback were present in many exchanges during directed playtesting and during pair interactions.

For example the emergence of the concept of safe zone in the game of Ch and Pa -
The concept of a safe zone arrives as a direct result of after adding a moving enemies GDP, the extensive use of that pattern dominates the game challenge to such an extent that it is essential for players to quicky identify and use 'safe zones'.


### GDPs propagation through peer activity leading from Playtesting

The implementation of similar GDP by participant groups and individuals often spread through peer activity that often emerged from play testing.

For example, the work of the child to add 21 levels to their own game served as a way to publicise this possibility. The process was also spread by that child's willingness to help others to add that feature to their game. This shifted dependence on myself as a facilitator, or on the instruction-based support documents. This excerpt shows this more experience child coder Te, agreeing to show another child Ch how to add new levels.

  Ch: Why’s that enemy in every level
  Te: He’s not.
  Ch: Can you show me how you add more levels on to yours?
  Te: Yeah sure.
  Pause
  Te: I’m just going to have one go of beating this (refering to his own game which he is playtesing). It’s 21 levels in it. So .. Yeeeeah.
  Pause
  Ch: It’s like parcours in Minecraft but times. It’s like playing the game Wipeout. Have you ever played Wipeout?
  Te: Er not really.
  Ch: Or seen it?
  Ch: That’s like my second level.
  Te: Ah so hard (Te fails at a high level on his game and starts to move off)

  Te: (To someone else  calling for attention)  No I’m helping ..
  (Te then follows Ch to his workstation to help him implement more levels.)

When Te moves to Ch's game he playtests it and then looks at the code. He notes that Ch has added a variable for a fourth level but then goes on to demonstrate to to add an array representing the next level, and a conditional statement to select level 4 when level 3 is completed. At Te completes this work, Ch reads aloud the code which is being typed in.


Ch is keen to make links to his existing experience of games making comparisons between Te's game, commercial games and his own.
The motive is not clear but this appears to act as a ay of Ch bringing his funds of knowledge on game playing and analysis to this community.

In prevelant GDPs in Te's game stimulates sharing about Ch's experience in other games. Parcour in Minecraft and Wipe out are both  game experiences whose main mechanic is about judging jumps to landing accurately.

Following research on funds of knowledge motives or benefits of this behaviour may include: ...
INSERT DISCUSSION AN DEVELOPMENT OF FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE STREAM
MAKE LINK TO NEXT SECTION

In addition, exchanges like this allow the propagation of GDPs
The process of playing a game of another and sharing your appreciation of it invites participants to add new patterns to their own game. In this example the process is very direct with the one asking another to help them directly. It is very likely that Ch has noticed Te helping others add levels to their games and thus this may help him to feel empowered to do the same.

### GDPs and the sharing of personal experiences, identity and preferences  (cultural) -

In the previous example Ch was able to draw on his home knowledge of games and game culture. This section widens focus to also examine the intersection of GDP and of non-gaming experiences.

As we explored in the introduction and literature review, the ability to incorporate the following elements into created games and playful digital designs allows for personal expression in a way that can be engaging and sustain motivation [papert, roque, kafai etc];

- design graphics
- audio assets
- narrative elements
- physical computing

<!-- Recap from Lit Review / Intro -->

However these processes can expose and deepen key tensions identified in the _design chapter_ and in the literature review. Namely;

- time on asset design can detract from systemic and learning code concepts and syntax.
- incorporating familiar or personally meaningful elements can involve challenges including that of unrealistic expectations based on previous game playing experiences
- tension of a walled garden approach vs responding to freer design choices
- list others, draw on Roque, Kafai and Papert

This particularly salient to game making in a community context. As per work on Kafai and Roque who observe the following features of personal expression in a community game making setting.

- propagation of assets..
- pride sharing back?
- value of feedback, asset creation as a speciality

This section looks at the specifics of community aspects of personal expression in the data collected in this study, dealing specifically with narrative elements, and graphical and audio assets.

<!-- NOTE - CROSS OVER WITH PREVIOUS CHAPTER? PROBABLY DESIGN
(may need to move?)
Just create a summary here.

Existing research on digital making and creative coding has emphasised the role of personal expression to incentivise the creative process [Scratch roque community]. The creation of personally meaningful object to share with a community is a foundational concept in Papert's constructionism [CITE]. While the 3M design is more limited than a Scratch media project in the potential to incorporate home interests, participants did embrace existing immediately clear possibilities offered by the certain GDPs in the 3M starting design.

<!-- NOTE - add into the design chapter - challenge of personal expression, incoroporating previous gaming interests and unrealistic expectations.

<!-- NOTE IS THE FOLLOWING ALSO FOR THE DESIGN CHAPTER?

Another opportunity involved choice and design of game assets that allowed the expression of identity or a designed element - for example graphics, audio or a written message to appear at various stages of the game.

The incorporation and design of game assets is taken as work on GDP for the purpose of this model.

The core GDP involving game assets already exist in the starting template.
- Objects as a reward to incentivise player exploration
- Objects as a hazard penalising player progress

The starting three assets, player, hazard and reward provide a scaffold to  guide  the choice of game possible themes.

The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game.

#### Narratives and aesthetics of Games driven by Home Interests

- Interview data - Fi and Ma - talk of the way they incorporate interests of trains into the game.
<!--
also in [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;] -->

As part of the creative process participants were able to input their own preferences and interests. These commonly seemed to be driven by existing preferences and habits stemming from home life and other cultural sites.
Examples include participants choice of the theme of their game. Environmental aspects appeared to be something that many families could draw on from their home lives.

The design processes involved choice and design of game assets that allowed the expression of identity or a designed element - for example graphics, audio or a written message to appear at various stages of the game.

One pair Ch and Pa the grandparents of Te, included narrative text at the start of their game which explained their choice of graphical elements.

     var starttext = "This is a game which pits a honey bee
     against a swarm of Asian hornets,
     which are alien invaders attacking bee
     hives in the UK and which beekeepers
     are trying to stop spreading here.
     Try to guide the bee to collect all the
     flowers without being caught by the
     hornets.
     Use the arrow keys to move the bee.
              Press return to START.";


In a noteworthy exchange a young participant Zi asks one of the grandparents of child if they had done any amazing things in their life. This exchange follows

   zi: Have you done amazing things?

The exchange seems to throw Pa but they draw Zi's attention back to the game. Showing that it demonstrates their interest in bees as they are beekeepers.

The source of Pa's hesitancy to share more is not clear. However her willingness to share that part of her personal story via the narrative of the game is shown here as is the willingness of the young participant to ask about the personal experiences of the older participant during the process of peer testing her game.

Participants Ma and Fi designed one game around the characters of a train driver that needed to collect coal.

In an interview exchange this pair

While these pairs had the most clear links to home interests in terms of a guiding narrative of the game, other participants were able to bring personal expression to the process via game assets in other ways.



#### Visual asset creation and selection   

- Mi's interactions around graphics creation - write up transcript
- Mi's exploration in others.

There was a high degree of personal expression through interaction with the process of creating visual assets in particular.

NOTE THE NEXT SECTION IS QUITE GENERAL MOVE TO START OF THIS SECTION OR LIT REVIEW?
The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;]

In this exerpt parent Mi has spent

    St:  That's Good!
    Mi: Oh do you like it?
    St: Yeah
    Mi: Thank you. I'm very proud of it. Concentrated extremely hard. The thing is, you can get quite consumed doing things like this can't you?
    St: Yeah
    Mi: That's the problem at home I get a bit kind of lost. I can't get the knack of some things. It takes me so long to get it. I'm like  so excited.   
    - Both laugh.
    St: So are you going to do bits at home? When the kids are..
    Mi: I tried and I lost it all. And you know when you just completely... And even Ne didn't know so I just ... what a shame..  hours ....
    Laughs

    Mi - Lost time. Never mind.  We live and we learn.   

    Mi – We’re finished.

    Mi  - Right what’s next? Now I’m an expert pixel?
    Mi – Now I have to figure out how to get it in there don’t I? Without losing it I’ll be very upset.
    St – Have you saved it?
    Mi – No I’ve not saved it.
    St – Save there. (points to relevant button on screen)

We can see Mi cultivating a sense of ownership over the graphical element that she has created. There is also the development of a growing sense of competency in this area of asset design.


#### Other examples

**Repurposing graphical assets  in a playful way**

Pair Sh and Th used a graphic of a cute dog as the background of their game.  

- playing around the graphic - covering it over and revealing it

The child expressed a lot of positive regard to this dog and used it a way to stimulate conversation about their home interest in dogs during play testing.
- participant self-expression and a conversational prompt to other during sharing of the game

The subject was completely unrelated to the previously stated theme of the game.
It may be the parent knew this was a way to sustain involvement and interest.

These interactions re sometimes playful, and sometimes chance to share something serious. It allows young person to talk about dogs and their love of dogs. Even at one point that they used to have two and one died.

**Audio assets**
In the second iteration of glitch game club participants were introduced to tools to create sounds and a free audio resource repository. This allowed for rapid, broad strokes personal expression in a similar way to the use of graphical elements.
Examples? Ru and Ro ? in one of the later weeks?

#### Discussion  

Cultural interactions seem to be able to motivate and sustain other interpersonal activity which may be experienced as work.
This is supported by other research on digital making and motivation. CITATION HERE? - or in cultural discussion?

**Limitation of asset work as a GDP**
Note the limits of this interpretation.
While the reinterpretation of the MDA framework into a menu of GDP is practical for the elements that they want to change, it is not strictly a pattern to be implemented here.
A tension here to be briefly explored or noted to explore later.


### Use of GDP to facilitate apprenticeship in wider cultural practices

Participants draw on their cultural experience at home and from work contexts to guide interactions with others. Some experience is of general coding proficiency and practices (previously explored) while other experience relates to experience of GDPs through home game play.

#### Practitioner and setting influences on community apprenticeship practices

It is important to address contextual factors that facilitated and shaped development of some initial creative practices.

Research and teaching practices, the location at the university and being part of a research project. Eliza effect? If so how relevant?

Availability of resources potentially novel. For example, the ability to have that number of identical computers for this audience in particular, and using this shape of working which was determined by technical reasons but which had an impact nevertheless on the ability for students to move around the room and the absence of a front for the teacher to teach from. After attempts in previous sessions I abandoned attempts to use the screen in the space to do explicit teaching. The process was very disruptive to the emerging group behaviours and practices.

I set up the working pattern based on my professional experiences and my own academic and cultural interests. As mentioned in the introduction, DIY culture, remix culture, repair culture, TAZ events are strong influences to the learning design based on the ideals of an autonomous community.

However, my choice of a walled garden approach in terms of limited GDPs and bespoke documentation came in to conflict with the professional practices of some parents with coding experience.


#### Use of Help and Documentation related to GDP

<!-- NOTE - Keep only the parts specifically on GDP -->

The use of help files and other documentation was explored in the last chapter but the specific use of GDP related support is explored in this section.

<!-- NOTE -
The language used, affordances, 2nd stimulation, practices, needs clarification.
 -->


**_Use of a non-linear menu of Gdp_**

Learning resources were presented in a menu format with graphics focused on the player experience rather than underlying coding constructs. The purpose was to;

- increase learner engagement through accessible design
- make documentation relatable to existing gameplay experience
- develop use of common GPD terminology

There were two main ways of approaching adding a new pattern. One to examing a code example which was built around the same code base.
This would involve searching for new code constructs and notes in the code designed to orientate the learner, alerting them to the location and purpose of the relevant code. The other was longer form step by step help.

**Use of simple code examples which demonstrate the pattern in isolation**

Code examples were initially the starting resource. The idea being it was quick to see the behaviour in context. This was changed after this iteration based on the difficulty of finding the relevant section on step-by-step resources.

However the, use of code examples by Te in 2019-05-08 shows the effectiveness of the use of code examples by participants.

DEVELOP THIS EXAMPLE - RELATE TO PRACTICE OF CODE PATCHING (EXPLORED IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER)

These code example are a staple of professional sharing and problem solving practice.
They exist on the Phaser website, however their use there is not consistent and sometimes, as with many developer created documentation, focused on demonstrating the code constructs in isolation rather than in context.

**Non-linear step-by-step instructions**

Longer form step by step tutorials are common in computing education. Examples can be found in Code Academy, and in the education resources of RPi foundation. Many examples talking learners through steps to build a game can be found online with varied amount of explanation of underlying constructs and concepts. I started my journey learning JS games using some provided by Mozilla and the Phaser developers.

The approach used in the step based documentation I created varies from many in that rather than choosing a defined order users can choose which order they want to add game elements. The use of GDP aids the learner navigation of this process. This does add challenges however to the documentation authouring process.

An example of parent Sh interaction with long form tutorial follows. Sh engaged with the long form resources. While this process did not involve dialogue, the recording of her screen allows for a detailed description of how the resources was used.

Sh opens browswer to see list of code Examples, navigates to page, sees list of chapters, selects GDP pattern name, then follows along.
FIND THIS EXAMPLE AND WRITE IT UP / SEE WHAT IT ADDS TO THIS SECTION.

Interestingly, the online menus was not used by participants in any regular or consistent way. However, it did have a trickle down effect. Kay participants did either browse it, use it to try to solve problems or were referred to it my the facilitators. The patterns that those learners implemented were then remarked upon and taught in via peer to peer propagation.

<!-- As explored in the literature review, it is difficult to explore this pedagogical approach relation to other similar programmes due to the lack of data on specifics of the learning materials presented to participants. -->

**_A linear / step-by-step resource_**

While a manual was available, few participants worked their way through it chapter by chapter.

While I created this for the planners suited to this way of working and in response to feedback from parents in early designs that foundation knowledge would be useful, in practice, once their template game was up and running, there was little incentive to do use this resource. In terms of the objectives of making a playable game or adding particular patterns to the game the step by step resources would have involved backtracking. The process would have value to reinforce computing concepts present in the design.

The foundational concept here was that after making the game from a template. The linear resources would explain all underlying concepts that the starting template had initially abstracted away from the participants.

In my journal I named this concept _meeting yourself in the middle_ to represent the possibility of retracing the process of learning from first principles.
Narratively the equivalent of a prequel.   


#### Example of use of professional practices

The following exchange shows how the use of GDPs help participants navigate the professional practice of forking a codebase and the exploration of developer resources.

In 2019-05-08 Da and Te are working closely as a pair. Da invites thinking outside of the constraints of the suggested design early in this first session. The following interaction (see full transcript of interaction at the foot of this chapter) shows a rich interchange where the parent is trying to draw on the game playing experiences to promote innovation in the design of the existing template.

An interaction (see full transcript of interaction at the foot of this chapter) shows a rich interchange where the parent is trying to draw on the game playing experience

    Da: Have you thought about pushing it a bit further and have a different style of game?
    Te: What do you mean?
    Da: Well the previous style of game was a platform (makes shape with hands) game wasn’t it? You went along and there was gravity pushing down (points down). There are other types of games aren’t there?
    Te: Pause. I don’t know what to do thought.
    Da: Well quite but what other games are there?

Te adopts with this suggestion readily once he understands Da's suggestion in full.

He approaches Mick with a suggestion.  

    Te: You could have a game where every 15 seconds 10 seconds you could add and enemy to such and such a random number between such and such (holds up hands to indicate parameters). You could block it somewhere.
    Da: So instead of.. instead of the world… the world being sideways. We could have the world being looked down on. (reindicates the change of perspective)
    Te: Hmm. How should I do this then?
    Da: That’s a good question. Shall we ask Mick to see if that would mess things up or not?  
    Te: Mick
    Mick: Hi ya.
    Te: Erm. Thinking about what game to do . I was thinking can we make like a pacman game kind of thing (indicates movement of character with hands)
    Da: If we had an on the top game rather than a platform game
    Mick: I think it could work. You could kind of adapt that game by, kind of, removing gravity.
    Da: and see what happens?
    Mick: and see what happens.

Te is implicit in the use of is process, saying "I was thinking can we make like a pacman game kind of thing".
Da is more explicit naming the shift of perspective but also implying
Mick takes this to a different level by making reference to a key change of code that would be involved.
NOTE - LINK THIS TO LOA

Da speech show desire to for the pair to try something new. This may be to avoid repetition in the educational experience of the child or perhaps by the desire for challenge which would result from stepping outside of the existing walled garden of choices offered as existing guides. Their new choice is a change of perspective which involves a new game pattern of a new movement game mechanic. The specific proposal is to remove a jumping game mechanic and using a 2D top down movement mechanic used in maze and adventure games like Pac-man and Zelda.

However Da is still aware of potential challenges of straying too far from the template. He does not want to "mess things up".

This interaction has a parallel to a professional practice of "forking" code-bases in open-source code communities.
The parent checking with a guiding community member about the advantages and disadvantages of a major fork in the code structure.
Technically, he has the courage to divert from the existing game paradigm from platform to maze. Practically it brings up issues as many of the dominant game design patterns are different. Thus the first one they identify that of enemy following is not present in the current menu of choices.


My own positive response to their suggestion was driven partly from knowledge of Da's cultural background a both a professional coding and a volunteer supporting children's coding programmes. While simultaneously checking with other groups that they use the starting template as a base, to avoid overload as previously discussed in design decisions, I encourage this pair to see what happens as a potential learning opportunity. I am conscious that the change of movement may open up different possibilities for new game patterns that this pair may be able to solve. This outweighs the possibility that the pair will get bogged down in complex code problems or structures which may be beyond the capacity of the young person. After all even if they encounter father must solve, the apprentice does not need to understand everything in order to benefit from observing the master at work.

There are cultural elements here of a family learning culture between these two playing out in this space.

That way of approaching the task is very different from interactions with grandparents on a previous iteration.

    extract from 2019-05-08 - 20 mins
    Te – Right what shall we add next? So it follows?
    Da – yeah that would be interesting wouldn’t it.
    Te – you know like the ghost in pac-man
    Te – I think it’ll be in here. (Looking at menu of Game Mechanics – can’t see it)
    Te- Link to tutorials – goes to the online tutorials on flossmanuals
    Te – we could add some player health
    Da indicates at the moment this work ok.
    Te – shall we try to get Mick for this
    Da – ah we could google it.
    They google "phaser pacman"

This example is typical of other interactions of this pair. Te and Da's design process is more guided and focused than many other participants.

In this example the father starts as a facilitator, and takes on the direction of the child. However, as the dialogue progresses he is more directive, initially by asking leading questions, testing existing knowledge then when reaching the edge of the childs knowledge via more direct instructions.

This appears to be influenced by Da's experience as a software engineer and volunteer at Coder Dojo (Glossary).

In interview data De notes his approach involves consciously not taking on the keyboard and mouse use.

This process of active guiding but suggesting and seeking for the right answer appears as intentional from the consistent nature of the interaction and from a supporting interview.


#### Discussion and Transition

The potential tension here between walled garden and the wild west turned up by google searches is over come by the professional experiences of the parent.

The choice to divert is made possible by Da's expertise.
It also opens up the possibilities of other pairs to follow this path.
In a way opening up a new seam of community activity and family of GDPs associated with a maze
game.


There is a parallel here to play theory which identifies the value of playful environments to provide challenge but within some boundaries of safety. Here the pair step outside of the magic circle? to expand the circle? Shifting the tools and norms of the wider activity.

These two examples stem from the wider cultural experiences and practices of the pair's home coding style and the parents experience taking part in professional community coding activities.



TRANSITION -
While these examples highlight the use of professional practices and documentation, the interaction of Te and Da could also be studied from an interpersonal foci, one of guided participation. Da is modelling these practices, speaking them aloud and asking  
In the next section, the guided participation of other family pairs and more temporary pairings are explored.

## GDPs and Guided Participation

This section examines the use of GDP to facilitate guided participation in game making. The primary source of material is from pair interactions between children and parents.  

- If needed a quick recap on guided apprenticeship.

The following sections follow a formula; description, example, interpretation. An analysis section follows.


<!-- DROP LARGER CATEGORISATION - TOO ARBITRARY
### GDPs for project organisation / coordination -->






#### GDPs for prioritisation and informal task division

The following exchange between participants Fi and Ma shows GDPs being used to organise future activity.


<!-- Online version as table -  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLx8j9djYqJdZHwKJ09mmIDMYO7YqlMDhuHx2hiqpJI/edit -->

    M: I’ve brought the music, and also we could just concentrate on one thing and just change that.
    You know, keep working through.
    F: Yeah. I think I want to get an enemy in - oh no - my person animated.
    M: So you want to get your person animated that’s the main thing.
    M: Shall we concentrate on that and changing the platforms into something different?
    F: Yeah.
    M: Yeah?
    F: I also want to make a theme tune.
    M: Yeah it’s, that’s what I mean, you can’t just skip around like that.
    F: hmmm
    M: just cos it gets really overwhelming.
    M: Yeah..? So…?
    Long pause
    M: Well I’ll have a look at the code and see if I can make sense of that.

This example shows the use of the approximate names number of game design patterns by the child adult. These are get the person animated, get an enemy in, changing the platforms into something different, make a theme tune. Patterns and the multiple actions and operations they entail are referred to briefly using short cut names. At this stage of the design some patterns have been imagined and perhaps partly worked on and dis-guarded. This interchange shows a tension between a more chaotic style of working jumping from one goal to another and potential resolution with parental dialogue prioritising work to be done.

    Mick: Hello
    Ma: Hi Mick
    Ma: So we’ve made quite a lot of progress this week. I think the issue we’re having is that Fi’s super excited so we’re kind of jumping form one thing to another and that’s kinda overwhelming me a bit.


Father describes previous behaviour as 'skipping around like that' or 'jumping all over the place' (in the above comment to Mick) as unproductive, but reviewing video data shows a more complex picture. While the father seems keen to prioritise and then complete one pattern, the child takes a more piecemeal approach. Later in the session the father then gets drawn into creating audio assets after observing his son searching for suitable tools. Ironically, it is the father that becomes distracted from his stated task rather than the child.

<!-- NOTE: discuss the non-linear resources provided. Link this to Eriksson and collegeagues research. -->
NOTE - THIS DISCUSSION NEEDS MORE DEVELOPMENT


    Ma: Quite complicated. But we can do it. But it would mean a lot of mucking around
    Fi: Ah Er
    Ma: Which is difficult to do while we’re here. But it’s doable.
    Ma: It’s like a project in itself really.
    Fi: Project in itself?
    Ma: Yeah! (laughing). I just want to know like. We can get him in. So if I ask about the sizing.
    Fi: Hmmn
    Ma: I think you can edit the size here.
    Fi: Why don’t you go here for a computer and you can do that?
    Ma: Why. What. While you’re doing what?
    Fi: Um making a sound track or something. I could do something like that.
    Ma: Ok. Yeah. I’ll see if there’s any more computers in the cupboard.


The child's initial listing of features is a brainstorming technique. Such techniques are used to aid a creative process however the parent seems to lack the skill to map these out and then to work together to priortise them. Instead he appears to be keen to quickly pick one that seems manageable.

GDP are already being used as a way to set goals, track progress and prioritise but the process seems stressful or unsatisfactory. Some kind of support help scaffold this process would be potentially productive. Changes to the emerging 3M design to  provide such support are explored in the following chapter.

<!--
THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT
Or perhaps the parent steers the child into graphical areas as they are able to continue without stressing out the parent. Thus the child's compliance may be a kind or pragmatic decision to allow smoother progress. -->

The implementation of some GDP involved the use of different tools and activities. For example, the design of a graphical element suited some learners and they depended on the support of others to implement those changes in code.

For pair Fi and Ma the existence of GDP seems to empower the young person to direct a division on labour.

  Ma has been reading documentation on how to add animation to a character for some time.



Here, after a blockage, the child suggests continuing with activities to fit his existing skill set of creating assets in non-code / GUI environments. The child appears to make a tactical decision allowing the father to piece things together in the code based program.

 <!-- both with the familiar graphical asset tool Piskel and exploring new territory by researching an seeking a new tool for creating audio assets, specifically a background theme tune .  -->

The child is able to jump around and work on parallel projects using their existing tools set, or even taking on researching other toolsets, for example independent work to find an online tool to created . This serves the child as it allows them to keep busy and moving different parts of the overall project forward. In contrast, the parent shares both with the child and the facilitator that they feel overwhelmed by the 'jumping around' between different GDP stages. While the parent wants to stick to one pattern and complete it, they are still responsive to help the child when they get stuck on an alternative pathway they have chosen to avoid waiting on the parent.

While this may be stressful for the parent, lots of progress in the overall game project can be observed in any particular session and the child seems to be developing useful skills managing the parent.

<!-- While the above interaction between Fi and Ma points to the parent doing the heavy lifting for code implementation, this was not always the case.  -->


<!--
A SECTION HERE THAT COULD BE REPLACED.


Mi and Ne had a reverse relationship where the child would reluctantly implement the graphical changes in code but would pointedly not explain them seemingly taking pride in knowing something that her mother didn't.
ADD TRANSCRIPT EXAMPLE FROM  - 49:52.2 - 53:38.0 - 2019-03-18-mi
Here the child has a powerful position but misses a chance to develop useful communication skills.

The parent here takes great pride in the graphical work being done. This allows them a level of participation which is helpful without being stuck on more tricky technical or code related problems.
The design which allows choice of GDPs facilitates this. The process of building an identity as an individual or a family is shown in this families work on graphics.

Mi - Oh thank you very much. I'm very proud.

#### Direct task delegation and sustaining participation

NOTE Play up tension between get game done, and child involvement
 <!-- While there was no formal organising of groups in phase 2 and 3, the family bonds between parents and children created similar patterns of seeking validation, sharing planning. Although this was more the case for dyads working side-by-side on the same game, similar patterns existed for other configurations. -->

 The opening vignette shows the name of a GDP as a way to communicate about the shared work of making a game.
 The utterance by the child "Key Door Person" seemingly indicated that the child ceded responsibility to the adult. The child has judged it the level of complexity needed to add a new pattern into the code to be beyond her ability and delegates appropriately.

 |T: Go on then. Key - Door - Person.| |
 |S: Person?| |
 |T: Key Door Person.|(off screen) T indicates that her mother is the person she is referring to|

 Gesture analysis (explained in a the methodology chapter) is valuable to shed light on this exchange. It is the indication that the mother is the person who will be responsible for implementing the GDP that the child is tangentially prompting to be implemented.


 **Notes to integrate here**

 While the child makes direct delegation they are free to undertake other activities.

 - At certain points in the create stage the parent needs total concentration and is not able to respond effectively to requests of  attention.
 - At times the parent asked the child to seek help from facilitator.  
 - At another time, when the child was bored waiting for parent debugging, she approached the facilitator to ask for help on behalf of the adult without prompting.  

 This activity away from the screen could in some models be seen an non-productive. However, in a community model of learning this can be seen as legitimate peripheral activity [@lave_situating_1991], or as an observation stage of LOPI model [@rogoff_learning_2014].

 Indeed while this arrangement seems mutually suitable, the possibility for children to not engage in community activities is seen by Rogoff [-@rogoff_cultural_2003; -@rogoff_organization_2016] as an important characteristics in participation based models of learning.


### GDPs motivation and sustaining engagement

- these kinds of  exists in community in Playtesting - but different for side by side interactions - or are they - discuss
- what is specific about interpersonal interactions
- Example sh and Th - new element K and d - then adding a level
- Other examples needed?

The process of adding in a new GDP to the game was often a sustaining activity.

The transition from adding one GDP involves playtesting, which then often led to the identification of a next GDP to implement.


#### Ideation and Goal Setting

The provision of the menu of GDPs saw a rapid increase in speed or decrease in time spend in ideation phase.

This was welcome show by Ma's comment.
"It did go on for too long."


### Sustaining Engagement: Parental prompts aligned with ideation stages

This activity can be examined with an interpersonal focus it is the product of interaction between the pair and the parent highlights the pivot point which facilitates input and greater engagement. Cracking open a new seam of a GDP Key and Door allows for new possibilities.

The parent uses this transition as a prompt to stimulate new activity in the child.

The parent navigates this process skilfully and is able to incorporate the child's interests.

#### Example - Sh and Th (from Vignette)

The parent struggles to implement quite ambitious code challenges that she takes on but signals clearly when the process returns to ask / imagine stage. The completion of a coding task  
 indicating that she is aware of the greater possibility for effective child input at this stage.

In ask/imagine stages parent and child are able  discuss storytelling, graphical and other aesthetic choices

### Design and ideation: Prototyping a new GDP on paper  

When GDP was completed and participant or pair move to a new phase there is evidence of a reenergising effect. The use of varied tools and practices are a contributing factor to this effect.

In one example the parent notices the child's difficulty in using cursor and delete/backspace keys to edit a matrix allowing level design. The parent provides a book with grid paper to allow the child to replicate the matrix. The parent then transcribes the design while engaging the child by checking she has interpreted the design correctly.

INSERT CODE EXAMPLE FROM VIGNETTE - TO CLEARLY SHOW GRAPHICAL NATURE OF ARRAY IN CODE

The parent uses the graphical representation of design in the code template as a jumping off point to make a connection to home practice of sketching things out in paper.
The parent, when faced with a blockage,

and the process of turning that into reality on the screen and sharing with others is transformative in terms of energy level and interaction during the course of the session.


NOTE - RETURN TO THIS IN ANALYSIS OF TADS -

<!-- - in planning stages the parent provides scaffolding to help the child. -->

More on role of parent and child to negotiate approaches which maximise engagement / progress / keep flow .

- Fi and Ma also discuss the use of paper to clarify initial GDP ideas in interview data.

- Da - invites move to paper but Te happy to work on the screen for immediate feedback. keeping flow going.

This pattern completion is mirrored in the work of other pairs.

Thus replicating is a kind of participation in an emerging community.

There is also a link made by the parent to previous working practices. Using a paper book to make a sketch of the work to be completed.

These kinds of shifts of activity and cultural practices brought by the participants also feed into the ongoing culture of the game making community. For example the use of paper designs and paper prototyping that for some of the home ed families was a familiar practice was something that I adopted more broadly after observing the families involved.

### GDPs facilitating designing for others

As discussed, one interpretation - the one used here - of GDP focus on recognisable behaviour rather than hidden constructs or code patterns.
This helps a focus on a noticeable change in game play.  something  that others will observe and thus help participants to design for others.
AS COMPARED TO WHAT? WHAT WOULDN'T BE NOTICEABLE?

As explored, Playtesing as a regular practice is another way to shift learners into a perspective designing for others.

This was explored from a cultural plane previously but the process also was observed in practices in this study and in relevant reasearch (set up for discussion on this)

I found many examples of pair partners and peers nudging others into imagining others user experience to suggest game design alterations of additions.

#### Vignette A
In the starting vignette of the chapter both Th and Sh imagine the user experience and begin a conflict over it.

The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. “It’s no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid.” The child seems determined to remove all hazards. "It is for me!" the child counters. She may be aware of the implications for game balance but takes pleasure in this destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play (as explored in the previous chapter).

This interaction shows the parent guiding the child to imagine the user experience through the use of terms from GDPs. This process is repeated by this parent for other patterns in other interactions. In the vignette for example, Sh shares "Must be quite hard to get through that door." when Sh places the exit door high above a platform.  

Th - comments on wanting students to be frustrated when playing it, it's fun - then the final level being a secret fun experience playing against the norms of platform game design, thus illiciting surprise.

#### Mi? lack of appropriate challenge?

Move challenge here?


### GDP driving adoption of technical process and terminology

The emergence of terminology and technical processes happens particularly on a pair level. Sometimes very explicitly as a parent explains, facilitates or guides a process, as in the case of Te & Da in apprenticeship above. Sometimes this is more implicity in more casual help interactions.

The following examples shows a patchy but evolving use of some of the terminology that has been introduced partly by facilitator interventions and partly emerging organically through community iteraction.

<!-- This is also dealt with above "GDPs propagation through peer activity"
Find another example? -->

In the the following interaction between parent Mi and her daughter Ne, the mother wants to export an image from the graphical editing tool and to import this into the game.

NOTE - TURN THIS INTO A FULL TRANSCRIPT



    Mi - Ne!, Ne! Ne.

    Mi: Do you know how to get it in the game?
    Ne: Oh my god!
    Mi: Well . First of all save it to the gallery. How do you save it?
    Ah there you are. Save it.
    Is it saved?
    Right now export it.
    Ne: Do you even know what export means?  
    Mi: I know what export means!
    Ne- Ok then smartie pants.
    Mi: Right so I don't want this rocket here. I want the rocket to be the yellow thingie.
    Ne – Gold coins.
    Mi - Right so, What are you doing? Do you know what you are doing?
    I want the aliens to be the hazard, the rockets to be the gold coins and the spaceman to be the character.
    Mi: Poop Ping? (alarmed) What are you doing? What's poop ping.
    Where's my spaceman?
    Ne: Wait! What do you want the aliens as?
    Mi: The hazards.
    Mi: Yaaay!
    Mi: And now the rocket thing as the like you know the good thing - the reward.
    Ne: Who wants a rocket for their reward?
    Mi: Because if a spaceman gets to a rocket he can get home. But if he doesn't then the aliens get him.
    Ne: It's a very violent game.
    Mi: What  ?
    Ne: It's a very violent game.  


The mother develops her proficiency of expressing GDP related concepts and language as this interaction develops. This may be to show her increased level of understanding and participation on overall process after being challenged by daughter "Do you even know what export means?".

In any case this enables a more technical and critical discussion between them. "Who wants a rocket for their reward?"
Here the daughter recognises the GDP of reward after used by her mother but questions the aesthetic choice and its appeal to game players.

Ne appears reluctant to help at first and when she does she is mostly non-verbal and makes changes quickly in a way that her mother cannot then follow or replicate.


#### Interpretation of data on evolving processes

The process of explaining this to her parent would be more time consuming. There may also be a power dynamic happening as well with the child enjoying showing proficiency without sharing the process perhaps as a performative demonstration agency or growing status within this community.  

We can explore this behaviour from the child's perspective using terms from Activity Theory. The process of exporting and importing has become an 'operation' for Ne through repeated practice.


**Operations, actions and activity**

<!-- MOVE THE BULK OF THIS TO DESIGN CHAPTER TO HELP SITUATE THAT.
OR THERE IS DUPLICATION WITH MIDDLE LEVEL CONSTRUCT SECTION - SO MOVE THERE?
AND PERHAPS MOVE MIDDLE LEVEL CONSTRUCT TO NEXT CHAPTER -->

Analysing the implementation of GDPs as a unit of activity allow the use of useful concepts to explore the specifics of participant behaviour. In the methodology and design chapter I explored the concept of resolving tensions involved in tool use and interaction with the learning design. In this section I briefly explore the utility of the concepts of activity, actions and operations when applied to implementing GDPs [@kuutti_activity_1995].

  "...actions consist of chains of operations, which are well-defined habitual routines used as answers to conditions faced during the performing of the action. Initially each operation is a conscious action, consisting of both the orientation and execution phases, but when the corresponding model is good enough and the action has been practiced long enough, the orientation phase will fade and the action will be collapsed into an operation, which is much more fluent." [@kuutti_activity_1995]

As previously explored, activity systems can be viewed on different levels of abstraction.

As a common example the process of "getting it in the game".

    Mi continues to do solo design using the Piskel graphical too. She encounters a design problem. When erasing a part of the design she gets rid of background colour.
    Mi asks for help from partner but receives misleading advice which does not help her progress.

    Mi – Oh no it’s not done that has it?

    Mi calls the name of her child across room with theatrical gesture and loud whisper voice
    Mi – “Ne!”
    Mi then makes face, wiggles head and shrugs at parent peer. The other parent laughs.

    Ne arrives to help.
    Mi – I’m trying to delete them but they turn light grey.
    Ne – So you want to get rid of them?
    Mi – What are you doing? You have to tell me what you are doing so I can do it myself.
    Mi – laughs
    Ne – laughs.
    Mi – I’ll just have to keep shouting at you if you don’t tell me.  
    Ne uses the mouse to select the grey background colour with the colour picker tool, then the pen tool to fill in gaps in the design. She then swaps the active colour back from grey to black by clicking the option to swap foreground and background colours.
    Mi - How did you do that so quickly? I’ve got to like, carefully... (makes hand gestures to show a sense of hesitant keyboard use)
    Parent peer laughs
    Ne bounces up in place and smiles broadly.
    Mi- Thanks
    Mi – So am I like back with the black now?  
    Ne – Yeah but if you want to delete it just press X (which switches between foreground and background colours) and then do it.
    Mi – Oh X. Alright Bubs. Thanks.

Taking a more focused view of the activity here would be implementing a game design pattern - e.g. adding keys and doors pattern in this case. On the level of action, creating a graphical asset of a key and adding this to the level design. The operation would be the exporting the graphical asset as a suitable file format from graphical design tool and uploading it to the code authoring tool.

In this example, while the final an operation for some participants it would be a more conscious process, for others it has become second nature. To illustrate this take this interaction between parent Mi and child Ne.

In this interaction the parent is focused on completing the action of creating a graphical asset of a hazard as part of the activity of adding the GDP of including a hazard into the game. We can see that the operation of changing pen colours on the graphical tool is one which the child has been able to translate into a effortless process whereas the parent is still consciously building her competency.

This interaction underlies the validity of exploring the implementation of GDPs as a unit of activity as it allows for a more detailed and granular exploration of the many actions and operations that comprise each pattern. In the following sections, I draw on such detailed observations of participants in practice to outline how GDPs are used by participants.


<!-- (NOTE - OPERATION, ACTION, ACTIVITY - explore in aT part of this chapte ) -->


#### Interpretation of data on designing for others

We have explored in the literature review the value of design as a process, to see surrounding world as a designed experience, Latour.

Other researchers propose that early (all) stages of ask and imagine are more productive when informed by a realistic sense of what the end user experience is.

FIND RESEARCH TO SUPPORT

I also propose that the use of GDP as a unit of activity may help  the overall process of design for others by providing the FOLLOWING

- discreet and clear goals which are nested in the wider goal of making an engaging game
- clear terms to use as a lingua-franca during self testing and playtesting.


<!-- NOTE - ANY EVIDENCE FOR THIS BASED ON INTENTIONAL DESIGN OR IS THIS JUST AN OBSERVATION OF ORGANIC BEHAVIOUR?
Designing for others - as a key perspective in constructionism.
Note: What added insights or tips for practitioners can I bring here?
NOTE - cf Resnick Designing for Tinkerability - and the concepts in that.  -->



### Shifts in design practice

**Alternating coding**

The parent cedes the keyboard and mouse and sometimes swaps chairs to allow child to play test the game created.

This follows a pattern of X   
NOTE i FEEL THIS IS ALREADY COVERED?

cf - similar behaviour?

**Shifting between Facilitator and more active partner**

At one point the testing process here is quite frustrating as gravity value is very low making any movement very slow with little control. While the child has previously rejected increasing the value, the parent's initial acceptance of this decision is later questioned. The parent who has to do the majority of the testing is more insistent to remove a frustrating part of the testing  process.  

Discussion drawing on more radical attempts to describe the best way to bring young learners into a design practice.
Perhaps in the field of participatory design.

<!-- Highlight how the granular and relatable nature of GDP -->

Example of Te and Da  - 10-15 mins transcribe in more detail.

    They thinking of a feature – wrap around like Pac-man
    Da – Yeah we can do that. Save that for version 1.1

    Da – what’s the theme
    Da – sketch it on paper?
    Te – I’m just going with it.

Changes in GDP are apparent in the emerging game,   

In the example above where Te and Da are creating a new tilemap for a maze game, Te is able to map existing knowledge of tools and home knowledge of the kid of game he is imagining to rapidly make revisions.  

- Well suited to build a repeated design practice.
- Especially with starting documents,
- Small changes had big effects.
- Variable changes needed immediate testing.  

While the design suits repeated design practice as illustrated by the example above, not all pairs or individuals interacted with GDP in such a neat way.

A later discussion section in this chapter illustrates a more complex interaction with design stages.


### GDPs scaffolding the product revision process and debugging

- Participants spend much time in the stages of Improve and Test often as a solo effort.
- This process showed a personal appropriation of concepts like game feel / challenge
- When done as a pair GDPs aided communication during the process.


**Example Sh and Th improving their game**

- Parent navigates to a particular part of the code for child to alter design
- Child takes on challenge of making smaller changes once the core game mechanic code has been added.


#### Sh and Debugging as a domain specific practice

MAKE THIS MORE SPECIFIC - MOVE ANALYSIS  LATER -  CALL BACK TO IT
From video data I identified certain coding practices that were transmitted through interaction with the facilitator that this parent is quick to adopt and use. For example the use of the project documentation website. In addition, the debugging tools which the parent notices the facilitator using in this interaction is used by the parent in later sessions. The process of repeating the process of using the debugging tools and process builds fluidity.

**Reflection on debugging:** The experience of debugging appears to be a particular practice evoking certain feelings.
frustration and elation
See kinds of errors ??

#### Building fluidity on process.
The use of these tools and processes are introduced to solve a particular problem in implementing one GDP.
As per debugging.
However the same process is uses to solve issues that crop up while implementing other patterns. Throughout the recordings, the parent shows an evolution of problem solving knowledge and processes in relation to coding through their independent work.




## GDPs and the personal plane

<!-- NOTE - REMOVE THIS. INCORPORATE HERE?
The personal plane is explored in a following chapter (working title Maps).
This will cover findings relating to the value of participatory methods of mapping project progress and potential learning dimensions of activities.
-->
<!-- Provide a link to next chapter - but before that a round up / discussion / to specific elements in relation to GDPs
May need a way to differential this chapters discussion of GDP - and that of the next one.
 -->

<!-- NOTE - perhaps end this section with some observations of personal expression of understanding as per Bevan et al during playtesting. Then link to next chapter / discussion. completes circle? -->

QUICK SUMMARY
In this section the processes of personal appropriation of experience and knowledge emerging from game making are examined closely in relation to participants experience of GDPs.

 - quick summary of Rogoff's take on participatory appropriation compared to a transmission model of knowledge & that participants re-contribute their experience of knowledge beck into the social mix
- Note on why this section is less important in this research, the expression of personal knowledge back into a community context is covered in part above.
 - Example of mutuality - GDPs used in this research program were mutually created based on feedback from participants
 - While there is a curricular value attached to CT concepts & to some extent design practices, in this context participants can create their own understandings of what is useful to them.
 - While the practices them selves are valid without expressions of underlying concepts, these are surfaced especially in peer problem solving (beyond Guided participation ) and in feedback in playtesting.  

Question, rather than a focus on concepts of personal / transferable knowledge, how much of this section focuses on appropriation of practices.

Situation

  The concept of participatory appropriation refers to how individuals change through their involvement in one or another activity, in the process becoming prepared for subsequent involvement in related activities. With guided participation as the interpersonal process through which people are involved in sociocultural activity, participatory appropriation is the personal process by which, through engagement in an activity, individuals change and handle a later situation in ways prepared by their own participation in the previous situation. This is a process of becoming, rather than acquisition, as I argue later. [@rogoff_observing_1995-1]


### GDP as a way to surface Computational Thinking and Systems Concepts

 - CT concepts in a more concrete and abstract form arise especially in interactions with facilitator
 - Driven by integration with curriculum based learning settings to devise a map - similar to drive of Bevan and colleagues to justify learning happening in science-focused tinkering exhibits in museums [-@bevan_learning_2015; -@petrich_it_2013]


#### CTs emerging in the wild.
 There are several examples of CT arising in the wild without being explicitly taught.
 Here the focus is on Wing's narrower take rather than including general practices.


#### Decomposition.
 in 2019-05-08-te-da - Da the parent suggests revisions to the agreed overall goal which break a larger problems into more manageable steps.
 It can be legitimately questioned if this is a specialist skill rather than general good creative practice.

#### Abstraction
 This concept can be concretely taught using the code structure of functions -

 There is scope for doing this. In my journal notes and notes following interactions I notice when there is a call for a new function.

#### Generalisation / Pattern recognition

 Present in the work of Te to find patterns and to duplicate them in different situations.
 2019-05-08-te - With prompting from parent the child is able to recognise, duplicate and alter the update code for accepting left and right key input to change character x-axis velocity. After update and test iterations they change this to up and down key input to update y-axis velocity.  
 NOTE - Ideally find another example of a child doing this.

 The 3M approach lends itself well to exploring pattern recognition as patterns are readily available to participants in starting code and the extra patches that are added.

 Also the knowledge of the GDP helps ability to recognise patterns in the code. Left / right -> Up / Down

#### Sequencing / Algorithms.

 Sequencing and writing algorithms is one of the most common CT principles explored in research. INCLUDE CITATION.

 This is a relative weak point in comparison to from first principles approach.

 However the process of patching into different areas of the code and creating functions does address this.

 The following transcript of Sh's interaction with myself shows that the process of copying patterns in the template code and patching in new lines from the supporting documentation gives ample opportunity for sequencing mistakes to be made.
 The process of working with students on their existing code is valuable to explain why and how the order of lines of code and when functions are called.

 The comparison raises a potential discussion point on what the practical value of this CT concept is.

### Commentary of CT in the 3M model in particular
 More discussion  on the practical value of CT concepts


### Use of GDP when demonstrating understandings in community activity

#### Evolution of practices?

**Contributing back to Community**

In a previous section we examined GDPs used to build emerging community activity.

Here I focus on the demonstration of individuals of the growth in use of practices & concepts.

Use of GDPs are used to;

- increase effectiveness and confidence in communication surrounding articulation of characteristics of their and others game
- participate by asking for peer help using shared terms (see Mi below)

#### Evolution of language and use of terms? (compared to processes)

**Example - 2019-03-18 - Sh & Th in the same session as Vignette A.**

We can contrast Th's general lack of confidence in coding and other peer activities (where she remains on the periphery) with her strong ability to share back progress and decisions during the end of session playtesting.  

using language afforded by GDPs?

HERE INCLUDE  excerpt -  1.05 - Looking for Th using GDP language - as well ask drawing on other home interests.
FIND THIS EXCERPT

In the language of double stimulation, a tension of relative inactivity at times is overcome by invitation to play test and resulting interaction.

In AT the change of activity is a shift in scope of activity system. To a wider objective of making an engaging game.

Different AT scopes allow for different use of volitional TADS.



**Discussion**
The process of being able to map the demonstrations of development of understanding has value for practitioners.
See Bevan et al learning dimensions framework.


**On affordances and anchors - swinging on gargoyles**

<!-- NOTE
AT's relationship with affordances more here [@ba_erentsen_activity_2002; @] -->

Affordances have been misused, assigned magical properties, including agency of themselves. However, affordances are originally conceived of as part of activity, not separated from it. [@ba_erentsen_activity_2002]
Give example?

Then can be viewed together with the anchor metaphor as a catching point. Or to use a similar metaphor as a gargoyles for spiderman to shoot his webspinners at so he can swing from them.
[@hopwood_agency_2022].

<!-- NOTE - FOLLOWING IS TOO TECHNICAL - REWORD/ REMOVE
The pattern we see here is less relatable to every day game constructs in the way a game mechanic is. The pattern involved here is a coding pattern and a pattern in process. In code terms you need to add asset in preload, change name in create. In process terms you also need to export in correct format, note location of download, then using the editing tool locate and upload to correct area of the project file structure.
-->


#### Fluidity of practice

Another example shows an evolving fluidity in response. Ch incorporates a boost to player health after a level after being given feedback during playtesting.

Other participants also demonstrate fluidity of response although to a less sophisticated degree. The process of altering design especially suits a fluid response as makers build their design skills by rapidly altering  

This is participatory appropriation in that it is a new GDP that stems from original thinking on the part of the participant.  

#### Intepretation / discussion of personal practices / concepts

When pairs or individuals return from playtesting to pair design work they share comments and the are guided in future design decisions by their interaction with the games of others.

The process of playtesting other games allows participants to share their on emerging interpretations of game making concepts like game feel and challenge without being directly taught. Further, the community sense of what is appropriate of fun evolves as mutually and therefore cannot be taught explicitly.


## Additional Chapter Discussion

NOTE - in transition the element which show development of understanding via participatory appropriation can be highlighted.
BUT how much of this is for another chapter?
I NEED TO PRIORITISE.


The following observations are primarily focused on implications for practitioners.
A deeper exploration of other concepts may suit another chapter looking at synthesing observations in relation to broader research. In this draft the focus is included in each sub-title.





#### Use of restricted set of collated GDP patterns

This section;

- outlines the advantages to using a restricted set of collaged GDPs which participants cover step by step.
- compares again to instructional tutorials (previously explored in methods chapter)AND to the process of working on a sprawling problem which seems unmanagable - but which in with participants have to work with facilitators in depth to overcome issues to preserve a totally learner-driven approach (as per first iteration)

<!-- Or is the process of working on a sprawling problem which seems unmanagable,
but which in with participants have to work with facilitators in depth to overcome issues to preserve a totally learner-driven approach.  -->
Example materials / examples include;

- Te and Da's decision to explore a different starting point and add uncharded GDPs like following enemies.
- The reduced list of GDPs in a framework in Eriksson's intervention [-@eriksson_using_2019], to suit a younger audience / restricted time frame
- One to one instruction to explain concepts and allow freedom of choice is ideal but unrealistic in classrooms.


### Design patterns as a "middle level" construct to open door to more concrete and abstract (Wider focus)

<!-- NOTE THIS STRAYS IN TO CT - FIND THE DIVIDING LINE -->

In the introduction of this thesis I highlighted some of the challenges for inclusivity and motivation of more abstract approaches including a prescriptive approach to Computational Thinking. We have seen how Papert and Turkle celebration of diversity in approaches and in particular concrete coding approaches has influenced the design of popular educational programming software.  In this chapter we have encounter examples of the use of GDP as a concrete and relatable construct that facilitates communication, engagement, planning and division of labour. Then enactment of GDP emerged from this exploratory design to be the key unit of activity.

THE FOLLOWING NEEDS RESTRUCTURING AND DISCUSSION

In teaching computing pedagogy the concepts of levels of abstraction is explored in some depth with an aim of  [@statter_teaching_2016; @waite_abstraction_2016; @waite_abstraction_2018-1].

To quickly review LOA, the levels are Problem, Design, Code, Running the Code. And the purpose is, "Levels of abstraction has been interpreted as a hierarchy to enable teachers and learners to describe which level they are working at, rather than as a methodology for programming projects."[@waite_abstraction_2018]
<!-- See notes here
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1my3iDjivq64gdcXsmwqKVP0QJMDvfBN3MsD0FoeI4Qs/edit -->

In professional coding programmes design patterns, particularly in object-oriented approaches, are seen as a useful middle ground between abstract CT concepts and more concrete techniques [@dearden_pattern_2006]. The idea of middle level construct is also present in the research of eriksson and colleagues using GDP to collaboratively design games with young people. [-@eriksson_using_2019]

The concept of levels abstraction can also be applied to our analysis of the game making practices with AT concepts.
 - most abstract - Activity - making an engaging game
 - most abstract - Action  - choosing a GDP
 - most concrete - Operation - enacting in code

The observations of this chapter show the advantages of GDP as a tangible, middle level unit of activity to help not only the creation of designed objects and the development of personal knowledge but also the emergence of a community of practice.


#### GDP as concrete enough to be understandable but abstract enough to be replicable
In this context replicable means that once the implementation of one GDP is complete, the process of implementing another shares similar practices, thus building competency of learners.

In this context of novice coders in an informal environment it seems appropriate to introduce some levels of reusable practice whilst initially prioritising individual learner engagement and community participation.

Game design patterns contain elements of more abstract and thus repeatable structures thus fulfilling some of the promise transfer offered by advocates of Computational Thinking. This is explored in more depth in the next chapter.


#### Technical concepts suiting transfer

NOTE likely move this to another chapter.
Learning maps - additional discussion on learning dimensions - or conclusion / next steps.

While there are technical elements of transfer that were identified and included in the learning map I sidelined the study of them.

Specifically in examining the concrete implementation of GDPs there are transferrable concepts and practice involving practice which include;

- Use of levels as a array which is parsed by a loop to create layout
- Logic statements of varied degrees of complexity
- Functions - code patching into the right area

<!--
GDP, CT & Transfer
The heart of the matter here is how transferable knowledge is without a contextual meaning attached.  This is a contested area.
Firstly how wide should reuse be imagined? To other coding projects? Or wider claims as with Wing's interpretation of CT.
 -->


#### Use of GDP as communication short cuts

 **Discussing Game design patterns as a tool to expose and give participants a language to discuss and resolve tensions (Practitioner focus)**

 This section;

 - synthesises examples which highlight the value of developing share language and short cuts
 - explores possible drawbacks
 - looks at restricted

 Examples of short cuts include, "get an enemy in", animate player from Fi and Ma's exerpts.

 The advantages of such shortcuts are, as discussed to help with the prioritisation and ideation processes, to facilitate peer propagation of ideas, and potentially to inform debugging and improvements to increase game playability.

 However, there are challenges of the use of such short cuts including;
 - hiding more complex patterns within the name.
 - confusion over use of terms to new comers

 For example the shortcut of a name for a pattern in Fi and Ma's interaction hides a large amount of problems solving which seems "overwhelming"

### Call back to design practices
As per last chapter but develop in relation to GDPs

#### Game design to get under the hood - games as a design artefact

As per Bruno - we are surrounded by designed objects. This process of making lifts the lid on that process.

See example between helper and Pa in 2019-03-18 at the end.



### Strengths and Weaknesses of the GDP construct / terminology

The interpretation of GDP that this thesis adopts contains some weaknesses. The specificity of the term is weak in that in seeking to categorise a wide diversity of features that participants would want to add to the game to fulfil a pedagogical motivation of providing guidance and inspiration to the novice designers. The pragmatic nature of this interpretation can be contrasted to more formal definitions of say Game Mechanics related to user actions in the game [@sicart_defining_2008].

<!-- NOTE -  THIS CAN BE EXPANDED
more n Game Mechanics etc
-->
The term is particularly week in the area of Game Polish which involved were more aesthetic and narrative choices.

[]

These choices do not fall neatly in to the argument being constructed around the potential of GDPs to unlock repeatable, transferable practices. For example, some participants, specifically one who came as a friend of of others and didn't have direct parental help, spent a majority of time working on these patterns especially if assets are being replaced.

It is perhaps the term _pattern_ that is problematic here. It may imply a repeatable structural element rather than an aesthetic choices. Other academics have given a wider name of game elements [@tekinbas_gaming_2014] or lenses [@schell_art_2008].

NEEDS MORE DEVELOPMENT

<!-- However from the novice designers' perspective, there are elements of patterns involved. -->


### Link Paragraph to next chapter

A theme to follow up in the Maps / personal learning chapter is that of picking up on some of the behaviour of participants, especially that of experienced parents, experience either in coding practices of supporting their children. Once identified, how could beneficial interactions be encouraged in the next iteration of design.

Examples include;

- supporting reflection on design and coding concepts / skills.
- navigation / organisational support - use of a physical map.

For example, the use of CT concepts in a framework, listed as part of the initial design pattern card, which could then be discussed, ticked off or otherwise reflected on.


## Transcript Excerpts


### 2019-05-08-te-da pt 1

    Da: Have you thought about pushing it a bit further and have a different style of game?
    Te: What do you mean?
    Da: Well the previous style of game was a platform (makes shape with hands) game wasn’t it? You went along and there was gravity pushing down (points down). There are other types of games aren’t there?
    Te: Pause. I don’t know what to do thought.
    Da: Well quite but what other games are there?
    Te: I don’t know er.
    Da: Well I tell you what .. muffled.
    Te: Erm - (navigates to list of GDP for platform game)
    De: So. You played them before didn’t you (indicating grid of games )
    Te: What do you mean?
    Da: The flying game that’s a different kind of game
    Te: Oh like kind of like moving along kind of thing
    Da: Yeah and those where. There are games where you are in a world and you have to move around the world like pac-man (points down and moves an imaginary character around),
    Te: nod
    Da: There are games where things drop down like Tetris
    Te: … game. You could have a game where every 15 seconds 10 seconds you could add and enemy to such and such a random number between such and such (holds up hands to indicate parameters). You could block it somewhere.
    Da: So instead of.. instead of the world… the world being sideways. We could have the world being looked down on. (reindicates the change of perspective)
    Te: Hmm. How should I do this then?
    Da: That’s a good question. Shall we ask Mick to see if that would mess things up or not?  
    Te: Mick
    Mick: Hi ya.
    Te: Erm. Thinking about what game to do . I was thinking can we make like a pacman game kind of thing (indicates movement of character with hands)
    Da: If we had an on the top game rather than a platform game
    Mick: I think it could work. You could kind of adapt that game by kind of removing gravity.
    Da: and see what happens?
    Mick: and see what happens.
    Da: It’s not a bad starting idea is it?
    Te: I suppose make a new one (begins the process of remixing game from the template)
