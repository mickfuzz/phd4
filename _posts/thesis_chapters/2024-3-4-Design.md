2. How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?
3. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?


## A note on style

This chapter contains a large number of headings in draft form. These will be replaced with introductory sentences when structure is stable.


<!-- ## Notes on structure -->
<!-- NOTE:
Moved impact of software tools here - and overall on templated approach on a micro level  -  which therefore becomes less of this study's focus - and needs less evidence -->

<!-- - drawing mostly on my journal notes and the evolution of the tools and design themselves.   -->

<!-- - **Interviews (and Lit review ):** exposes motivations and barriers to undertaking activity  this domain from interviews with peer practitioners and literature review -->

<!-- However in terms of tensions - there is one on cultural tensions - this may need moving to the next chapter - a more thematic approach. -->

<!-- Also the practitioner interviews - could be a bit disjointed - as they do relate to cultural barriers and tactics. But could say those are explored in other chapters. DONE -->


## Chapter Introduction  

<!-- - exposes motivations, tactics for and barriers to undertaking activity this domain from interviews with peer practitioners (supplementing the literature review) -->

<!-- I am guided in this respect by the lineage of research of constructionism, and in particular the sharing of practice between researchers and teachers regarding the use of LOGO. A seminal example of this practice is Papert and Solomon's publication Twenty things to do with a computer which is replete with code examples and diagrams of their output on the screen [-@papert_twenty_1971]. Many such examples exist from Papert in published memos and grass-roots collaborations with teachers [^4]. -->

<!-- ---
NOTE
---

I originally structured the chapter around observations structured in the phases described in chapter three. This approach proved over-complicated, mixing the description of tensions which often spanned multiple phases.

--- -->
<!-- Due to the novel nature of the learning design, a detailed outline of the specifics of the participants experience of the design helps readers situate  the findings of the following two chapters. -->

This chapter contains a high level of detail on the technical elements of the learning design to situate the findings of the next chapter and to allow the design to be by other practitioners and researchers in this area. The format of this chapter can be conceived as a design narrative [@hoadley_creating_2002]. To do to this I include narrative descriptions of shifts between phases of design as it mutually evolved over time. The concept of design narrative emerged from DBR as a way to communicate the important detail of context [@hoadley_creating_2002; @brase_knowledge_2024; @bell_theoretical_2004;]. While DBR has its own language of argumentation [@brase_knowledge_2024] in this chapter creates a design narrative using the rich set of descriptive and analytical tools provided by third generation activity theory (3GAT). Specifically this chapter identifies, key activity units/systems, names system elements, addresses the evolution of the key pedagogical features of the tools of learning design used in my research process using analysis of elements of nested activity systems and emerging tensions in learning design.

Firstly, I describe activity systems at different scopes, focusing on the objective of participants and drawing on a vignette illustrating indicative participant activity.

Following this, I explore shifts in the design of the intevention.

tensions in design in a way which communicates relevant context through the analysis of three areas of emerging contradictions in activity. In line with Kutti [-@kuutti_activity_1995], the term area of contradictions is used as a wrapper for more specific tensions, barriers, breakdowns, conflicts that indicate an "unfit with (system) elements .

Three main areas of contradictions are explored in this chapter are as follows.

*Contradictions arising in use of coding tool use and game asset creation* - often experienced as more individual level

*Contradictions associated with project navigation and the use of supporting documentation:* interpreted here through the lens of guided participation

*Responding to contradictions  in cultural aspects of the game making activity:* In this section, I examine the impact of a process drama with an aim to establish and nurture community practice, exploring the value of introducing almost-real processes, near authentic tools and the possibility of learners developing learning identities within a drama frame.
This chapter ends with a synthesis to initial barriers to engaging in game making practices and initial interventions to address them.


MOVE TO DISCUSSION IF THERE IS A SUITABLE SPACE
The drama process is an example of an introduced cultural tool. The process acts as wrapper to several supporting techniques. the side missions to and to sanction different approaches, the imagined audience encourages reflection and semi-authentic approaches. It is the most advanced tools of a range that was put into place to create a space suitable for creativity, collaboration and self expression.

## Summary of design evolution

This chapter which is a rich description of the evolution of the learning design.

This section summarises phases of design.


### On the details of the design


### Phases and resources of the study



More than a design the result was a dynamic community which is analysed on several scopes of activity.



[Summary Table of Stages](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBoXJWw-aZUcc8EsAvT195CtHLSM468YOCD0sGzOuoA/edit#)
see updated table in tables subdirectory  


The following overview of activity use by stage focusing on the evolution of tools and processes concisely exploring the rationale for their selection or production. Fuller descriptions of the tools used at each stage and links to the online resources created are available as appendix 4.x

NOTE - PERHAPS Move to appendix - But mention here.

**Phase, Name and Date**| **Description** | **Starting Resources**         
|--------|------------|--------------|
|P1: Oct 2017 - Dec 2018; Experimental Course  | Participants started with no set plan or toolset and were asked to plan and make a game in two larger groups of 5-6 participants of mixed ages. After several weeks, a minimal incomplete starting game code template was introduced in response to student need.  Then One-off workshops at Mozilla and Feral Vector conferences and to PGCE computer students and the creation of a âhalf bakedâ game template |  Phaser 2.6.2 javascript library; Thimble code playground; online graphics editor Piskel; audio creation tools  |

#### P1: Exploratory stage: Oct 2017 - Dec 2018

<!-- NOTE - The evolution involves phases and then tension - what and how to cover both?  -->
<!-- This phase took place before the official start of this research and relevant ethics application. As such,  -->

Phase one was an extended, exploratory series of game making sessions over several months. This stage was aimed not at collecting user data rather than building my  competency as a facilitator. The process began with no pre-existing supporting materials. In response to need, I adapted a starting code template of a platform game and created various code examples to add functionality requested by participants. This template was adapted from an online tutorial to create a game of the _platformer_ genre  (see glossary), a move which helped to limit expectations of the technical complexity of their game. At the end of this stage participants showcased their games to students in the foyer of the MMU Brooks building. Generalised feedback from participants this stage included; a consensus that the process was too long; more guidance in the process of familiarising themselves the coding tools initially before undertaking ideation would be useful; group work was problematic given the lack of experience in this domain; and that the overall experience of working with code was difficult but rewarding (feedback notes are included as appendix 4.x). At the end of this phase I responded to this feedback and delivered three one-off workshops at conferences and community events. The compressed time frame sparked the use of new tools including a starting template and printable resources to accelerate the game-production process. The results in terms of engagement and impact on rapid personalisation of end products were very promising.

<!-- The requirements of this compressed time frame aligned with feedback to prompt me to design an accelerated process to bump start the game-production process. -->

<!-- The first phase of delivery in late 2018 was based on initial research stage; I drew on literature to identify factors to consider when designing for collaboration, adopting a project based approach inspired by design thinking.  -->
<!-- To inculcate parents and children in to the culture of retro video games I began initial sessions by inviting participants to older arcade games on laptops. -->
<!-- Game filled laptops.  
Should this be added to the table above
-->
<!-- The tools allow participants to create games using a combination of a free to use online tools.
an online  coding environment
using the phaser javascript game library (glitch.com), a pixel art editor (piskelapp.com), and a sound effect generator (sfbgames.com/chiptone). -->

<!-- #### The half-baked starting platformer game

NOTE - ALSO EXPLORED IN NEXT CHAPTER - HOW TO ARRANGE?

The use and design characteristics of the starting point of a half-baked game.

- Phaser 2 to avoid complexity of code structure
- 2D platformer - familiar to most - Mario and Sonic
- low-spec graphics
- game of player, platforms, and coins to collect and hazards to avoid.
- graphical level design
- key variables brought to the top
- simple structure of code in terms of aligning with framework and not adding extra functions


**Variable editing effective movement**

Player movement was a key to playtesting feedback as such three  key variables were highlighted at the very start of the game code and given descriptive names to facilitate their editing. When testing the game, the player's jump height was not great enough to allow progression up from the floor to one of the platform thus thwarting the collection of items.

Game progression require altering at least one of the descriptively names variables associated with jump height and then activating a preview window to observer the changes by playing the game in a new browser tab.
<!--FIND  Some evidence of building proficiency with significant work to change these three   

    // Variables that change how the player moves
    var gravity = 500;
    var velocity_x = 100;
    var velocity_y = 300;

While some participants engaged with extensive experimentation to find a player movement feel that seemed just right, others were much less concerted with this aspect of game play, lowering gravity drastically to allow a greater jump size but a more frustrating floaty jump.

**Level design and prototyping**

The starting game template included a minimal amount of platforms, hazards to avoid and golden blocks to collect. Image 4.x above show a printable _quick start_ cards to aid participants to begin the process of changing level design.

As preThe possibility of disturbing the syntax of the  of code in the array. When participant did this it provided a good opportunity for facilitators or parents to outline the importance of correct syntax of and to explain the code structure.

The vignette in the last chapter saw Toby's adding new levels to his  game and undertaking many iterations of changes to the level design. He and several other participants spent extensive time performing level design activity with a goal of making the game extremely challenging but still technically possible. Others played with the convention of the game by removing all hazards and filling the screen with rewards/coins (an example is outlined in the starting vignette of the next chapter).

**Incomplete graphical blocks & Piskel**

The use of blank, coloured blocks of 32 x 32 pixels encouraged participants to change the graphical design and the relatively small size of the sprites encouraged rapid design.

PERHAPS REPLACE THIS WITH SCREEN SHOT OF PISKEL AS A TOOL
![](./Pictures/whale_1.png){width=50%}

The process of creating a pixel art characters and hazard involved using an online grid design tool called Piskel, creating an design of an appropriate size, saving, exporting as an image, downloading to the hard drive of the laptop in use and finally uploading and incorporating the image into the code project and linking using   code syntax.

#### P3: Accelerated game making programme (5 weeks): Jan - Feb 2019

By the beginning of P2 most of the resources and activities were in place and relatively stable. There were some incremental evolutions in the template that stemmed from participant feedback and my reflections. Key additions at this stage to support the use of a template were a collection of tutorials and code examples illustrating key game features that had been requested by participants. The collection of game patterns were presented in a web page together with the starting template and a link to an online book collecting the process into step-by-step chapter based tutorials. The resources are explored in more depth in sections three and four below. A more complete description of the resources used in P2 and P3 are included in appendix 4.x.The experimental team consisted of Home Educating families . Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly.

Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.

#### P4: Adding a process drama to the game making programme: April - May 2019

P3 used the same toolset as P2 however in addition, drew on my previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department [@caldwell_drama_2019] to create a simple drama process to give an external motivation and narrative to the creation of games using for a fictional audience of visiting aliens. The participant activity of these stages and tensions between system elements are discussed in detail in the remainder of this chapter and in following chapters.

<!-- #### P4: Adapting to MakeCode Arcade and more formal settings: Jan 2020 - September 2020

I also adapted and advanced resources with an aim that they could be used within secondary classrooms to support computing curriculum. To do this I added a learning dimensions map, a process which is explored in a later section of this chapter. In 2019 MakeCode Arcade was launched to make games using for novice coders via the use of a block coding approach. In 2020 I ran two iterations of game making course using MakeCode Arcade. The facilitation techniques and approach were adapted from those of P2 to facilitate the use of the block coding language [^1]. Tool use at this stage is also explored in a chapter in a collection on K-12 computing education [@chesterman_game_2023].

This thesis draws for the most part on data from P2 and P3 and thus focuses on text-based coding as a primary method. -->


<!-- At this stage of writing I include a bullet point list of design relevant features to be expanded later.

- Shared repositories of resources - users shared a log in so they could see the work created by others.
- Showcase: At the end of the game making process students asked strangers to play their game in the foyer of my departmental building
- Drama Games: the process of warming up, creates community and sets a tone
- Drama Process: specifically designed ot  overcome limits of the classroom.
- Playtesting: the process of playtesting, either self or peer links back to a community purpose

## Analysis of dimensions of game making activity using 3GAT framework

<!--
#### Code Playgrounds
Find definition
NOTES ON CODE PLAYGROUNDS
However in its styling it is playful and editorial picks and write up celebrate a playful spirit of creativity and sharing. There are strong parallels in this presentation to that Scratch community and to the sharing ethos integral to the maker-movement (explored in Lit Review). The interplay between play and work via shared experimentation is developed further in a later discussion chapter.
#### Online graphics editors - Piskel -->



<!-- The tool shown in screenshots is the code playground glitch (see chapter 2 and glossary). -->


In line with the process outlined in chapter 3, the following sections outline different scopes of activity, at times using detail from vignettes described in the appendix to describe the activity of participants and to introduce tensions between system elements which are explored in this chapter.

<!-- I use concepts from activity theory to describe elements of the activity system and identify intersecting or nested systems of activity and their differing goals. -->

<!-- The following sections describe of the vignette above focusing on the overall activity and its place within evolution of learning design.
Subsequent analysis of the identified activity systems allows both the researcher and practitioner to identifying existing and emerging tensions and to thus observe (spontaneous) or plan (designed) responses. While this chapter focuses primarily on the tools and resources, future chapter also draw on this framework for wider analysis. -->
<!-- ALTERNATIVE SIMPLIER INTRO TO THIS SECTION -->

<!-- Each section follows a pattern: the activity is described in general, then examples of activity at that scope from the vignette above are described, ending with brief analysis or signposting to where the activity in explored in greater depth. -->

<!-- The following descriptions mirror the work of AT researchers who conceptualise scope of activity as concentric circles from Broffennbrenner with "larger" scopes of cultural and societal goals and smaller, narrower, lower scopes of more personal activity [Engestrom][Cole]. -->

<!-- A short description of the activity systems follows the vignette above to help the reader establish a broad understanding of the processes involved before further analysis. I signpost the reader to other chapters when the described activity is explored in more detail there. -->

### Environmental factors and objectives

In socio-cultural approaches is it important to situate the context of the learning environment within wider systems of activity. In line with Engestrom's concept of shared object explored in the previous chapter [@engestrom_expansive_2001], I have selected several relevant systems and represented them in an illustration 4.x  below.

<!-- NOTE THERE IS A MISMATCH BETWEEN DIAGRAM AND THE OBJECTIVES - CHOOSE ONE - AND MAKE IT CLEAR -->

This diagram is necessary simplification of contextual factors and objectives of interacting, focusing on research goals on the part of the researcher, learning computing skills and concepts as a home education project and finally a broad aim of fun on the part of the children participants. In the previous chapter we explored the technique of describing a shared object. The utility of this approach is to acknowledge and represent the diverse cultural contextual factors that are played out in a new space between diverse actors with different agendas.


<!--
Other relevant objectives of re include: a desire to create a useful learning experience on the part of student helpers; participating with other home educators in a creative environment and thus building team and communication skills;. -->

<!-- NOTE MOVE PREVIOUS Chapter?  -->


![Illustration 4.x - Broad Environmental Activity Systems  ](./Pictures/At_dia_3_v2.png){width=95%}

In this research I take the approach of treating this shared object as an activity system in its own right. Lecusay takes a similar approach [@lecusay_telementoring_2015] and describes the shared object as an ideocultural hybrid which develops into its own activity system. The concept of ideoculture is used in this study  to deepen the description of the community dimension of 3GAT.

<!-- NOTE - WHY IS THE CONCEPT OF IDEOCULTURE USEFUL HERE? -->


<!-- NOTE - CAN ADD THE OBJECTIVES / LEADING ACTIVITIES INTO THE ARROWS ON THE DIAGRAM -->
<!-- While the limited example above of Toby's activity illustrates fun, additional data from interviews with this child and family back the broad goals above. [develop - perhaps an appendix or quotes] -->

<!-- As previously explored this mirrors the Activity, Action and Operation hierarchy. -->

Following Barab's description of nested activity systems [-@barab_using_2002], this shared system, whose objective is to make a games for an audience to play,  can be seen not only as nested within the wider systems but also as a container for  other  activity systems nested with that. While this overall approach is considered valid [FIND OTHER SUPPORT], the danger of fragmenting activity to much is to make matters confusing. The job of the researcher is to prioritise systems to describe and analyse based on the area of study and the concerns of the participants. This prioritisation in AT is sometimes conceptualised as the process of finding a key units of analysis. In the process of research I have found two units of activity particularly illuminating, one being the shared activity system described above of making a game in a community process. The other, narrower in scope can be described as implementing individual game features. Beyond these key systems, I draw on the concepts of actions and operations within systems to describe tensions and contradictions which emerge in the research process [-@leontiev_activity_2009].

<!-- GDPs ( conceptualised here as game design patterns), which while often implemented on an individual or pair scope, were also fed back into community activity.  -->

There are diverse end audiences for the games. The final target audience are students and staff in the Manchester Met Brooks building where the created games are shared in arcade cabinets at the end of the programme. An additional audience are friends and family who can be send the games to play online. The more immediate audience for the evolving games are peer game makers during the making sessions.

![Carrot eater game with an self made arcade unit made from cardboard boxes](./Pictures/carroteater3.jpg){width=90%}

While the broad aim of making a game to share is agreed through participation, there are also diverse motivations stemming from environmental factors in the interrelated actors in this activity which feed into the contradictions which emerge at this level of activity.

#### Illustrative vignette on participants activity indicating general activity of participants


The purpose of this vignette is to illustrate some of the key features of the overall game making activity in relation to activity systems and relevant system elements. (included as an appendix of this chapter as Appendix 4.a -
[Link to online version here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vYeVxYaRMTWPDOHwC4DEGYAkGPRIDX7wLiz0l8b7LWc/edit))

The participant, a child Toby, has been working independently on the design of a platform game for several minutes of the session. As a facilitator, I draw the participants attention to the showcasing of their games to an external audience to focus their attention on completion of their games. Toby pays close attention to the challenge and variety of the game playing experience for his imagined audience of players. During the course of the session Toby invites many other group members to play his game. He initiates and responds to conversations around the difficultly of the game he has designed. The more immediate audience of his peers is clearly important to him in guiding his actions.

He uses a variety of tools in the process of coding and testing his game including: a web based coding tool (code playground), a game template which he has used as the base of his game project and,  a menu of documentation linking to code examples and tutorials test    

While this vignette shows that the participant has developed fluid use of both software tools and documentation and support sources, these are areas where significant contradictions emerged which shaped the path of the support given. Contradictions concerned with use of core tools and additional documentation and support are explored in two later sections of this chapter.

The later section of the vignette shows evidence of elements of an emerging ideoculture of this group. A student helper shares a question -  "Is yours the one where level one is harder than level three?". This is indicative of some of the emerging playful approaches that younger participants in particular are taking to the overall process. This represents an example of the influence of the wider systems of play of on the shared ideoculture of the game making commmunity. The complexities of processes to create adn to help resolve contradictions as this cultural domain of collective making are explored later in this chapter.


<!-- IS THIS NEEDED? While the programme had a shared objective of making a game, there were tensions brought by the cultural factors and other objectives imported from other activity systems. The third contradiction explored in this chapter explores those tensions (including? ....). -->


<!-- In the vignette of Toby's activity this wider objective is present in the facilitator orientation at the start which references this audience -  _the Monday after we can play our games and we can share them with students. We can make the students frustrated when they canât beat our games_. At the end of the vignette text, one of the student helpers also imagines this audience playing the game of Toby.    -->
<!--
NOTE - More on large scope in AT terms? What is needed here? -->


### Constructing a game feature by feature

Within the activity system of making a game, in analysis of video data and evolution of course resources from P2 onwards, I identified activity happening at an individual or pair work which emerged with distinctive characteristics.

Activity was driven by learners setting goals, requesting help and then implement code structures based around altering or adding new features to the game using tools available in the learning environment. Participants also worked on audio and graphical assets to achieve this  objective.

While is it possible, aligning with Levontev, to identify the implementation of features as actions within the wider activity, there is value in  treating of implementing each GDP as a sub-project or activity systems in its own right ( NOTE - or at least as as a key unit of analysis). Barab and colleagues justify smaller units in their study observing emerging practices in a technology rich learning environment [@barab_using_2002].

<!-- One observation from he experimental course was that without significant support, the process of making a game is complex and there are many possible blockages in the process. -->

<!-- NOTE - THIS IS ANALYSIS  -WHERE TO PLACE IT?
By this stage, the process of collecting a user generated list of features and trying to respond to all of them as a facilitator had been abandoned as unrealistic. -->

<!-- NOTE - how much from p1-4 below to include? -->

<!-- In the example above Toby progresses from playtesting his own game to altering it. The code to change the layout of the platforms of the game is already included in the starting template. Thus is able add a new platform by making simple code changes. Toby retests the game immediately by clicking on the preview element of the code environment.  -->

<!-- However within that wider objective there may be a variety of goals depending on the participant. In this case Toby's goal is addresses the challenge and variety of the game playing experience. -->

<!-- Toby builds his competence in the process of comparing the own code to the code example to work out what code is new and relevant to the desired behaviour. -->


Later in this chapter we examine in more detail the emergence of  game design patterns as shared concepts and the implications for activity in more depth. At this stage is it sufficient to stage that game design patterns emerged as a shared object as descbed by Engestrom in x.

INSERT ENG'S DIAGRAM HERE FOR NOW - AND CALL BACK TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER.

DEVELOP THIS IDEA HERE OR MOVE IT TO DISCUSSION WITH SOME KIND OF SIGNPOSTING HERE.

![Illustration 4.x - Shared object of implementing GDP  ](./Pictures/At_dia_4_v1.png){width=95%}

This diagram above helps illustrates that the object of activity here is not only the code and game assets which participants are working on. In addition the emerging concept and group understanding of the game design pattern becomes a share understanding on a community level as playtesing, pair work and peer help happens.

Objectives at this level also vary between participants with some more straight-forward and others more tricky based on their making style. For example, beyond a purely utilitarian objective, a further objective in implementing a GDP, e.g. a new graphical element may be to increase a sense of personal identificaiton with the game as an vehicle for personal expression.  MOVE OR EXPLAIN

ALTER THE DIAGRAMS ABOVE TO REFLECT THIS.

An illustrative example of the use of the diverse tool set merits a summary before further discussion in this chapter.  By this stage of the process, Toby is able to browse a collection of game design patterns and use diverse of tools, resources and processes. Participants developed preferred approaches and tool choices especially in accessing help when adding a new feature to their game. In the vignette 4.a I outline the two main sources of help at the level of adding a new feature to the game: "Hereâs the tutorial and thereâs the examples of code". In the course of the vignette above, Toby chose to access only a code example of the desired game behaviour. He did not, as some in the group were doing in this session, use the tutorial which provided more descriptive, step-by-step guidance. Other participants relied only on direct verbal help from myself or other participants (like Toby) to help them progress.

A later section of this chapter details the different supporting documentation guiding participation in game making practices. Chapter five then explores activity occurring at this scope in more detail with a greater focus on emerging concepts as tools.


<!-- While some game patterns were simple to add, e.g. altering the location of platforms, other more complicated features involved several stages and varied tools to implement. The next section describes these stages as discrete code and design structures. -->

<!-- NOTE - Other participants;s motivations - explored later? -->

<!-- Other participants were less proficient using this online resources and used printed out versions of documentation. -->

<!-- In the next section narrower actions still within this system are explored as discreet actions which combine to be come the activity of implementing a game pattern. -->

<!-- Table 4.x.  Tools used in lower-level objectives of implementing specific code structures or stages in creating game assets -->

### Smaller objectives and actions - Implementing discrete code and design structures

<!-- For example, creating a new graphical element in a separate online pixel-art editor called Piskel, exporting and downloading it to the laptop, and uploading it to the glitch code playground and then making code changes in several parts of the code to initialise and implement new behaviour for this element. -->

Within the objective of adding or altering game features (also referred to as game design patterns here), implementing more complicated patterns involved several stages and varied tools. Using the terminology of Leontiev [-@leontiev_activity_2009], participants undertakes certain chains of processes in a fluid way that shows that actions had become operations (as explored in chapter three). In vignette 4.x, an example of such an operation is Toby's quick navigation between different areas of the game code, the game preview window and other sources of documentation. In contrast, some tasks are new to Toby and are performed more hesitantly. In the vignette's description, it can be observed that at times Toby is careful and hesitant, checking and rechecking the process of copying and pasting new code into his game from the code example of a design pattern he has chosen.

<!--NOTE As a facilitator of a community I aim to notice these transitions as I aim to use the proficiency of participants to help distribute the process of helping peers. -->

Identifying shifts in participant activity in terms of scope facilitates analysis of the complex and interwoven cultural, social and personal actions in a communities activity [@rogoff_observing_1995]. Above, Toby shifts between the wider activity of making a game and sharing it with peers and narrower actions implementing concrete code structures. This aspect is developed in chapter five.

In addition to these shifts in scope, analysis of community processes also involves transformation over time.  The next section offers a description of the evolution of tool use in different phases of the study with an aim to situate analysis of emerging tensions in the use of tools, resources and processes in the following section.


<!-- In this thesis, chapter six has a focus on cultural aspects of making a game together and chapter five explores social organisation around the activity of adding game design patterns chapter five.  -->

<!-- After inserting the code which adds a moving enemy to the game, Toby spends five minutes altering the variables involved to match his design and to create a level of challenge that he is happy with. -->

<!-- Toby makes quick progress. one factor here is willingness to make mistakes. There is a confidence here in undoing mistakes, commenting out new code to return to previous behaviour.

The trial and error approach also yields benefits, a mistake in the values edited creates an unexpected result of the enemy moving vertically instead of horizontally. Toby embraces this mistake and shares his account of this happy accident enthusiastically. -->



<!-- NOTE
Each of these with differing levels of abstraction.
Break down that of GDPs? -->

<!-- In the last chapter, we examined the use of Rogoff's 3 lenses of cultural, social and personal activity. We can see a broad alignment of these lenses and the scopes of the activity systems above.

This has utility to both researcher and learning designer. The observations of the following chapters are based on this approach of using lenses to focus in on relevant activity.

<!-- to highlight possible tensions and contradictions between competing goals of interrelated activity systems. -->
<!-- For example a common contradiction may be an immediate goal of children to mess around, play games and have fun while the goals of parent may be to maximise the acquisition of skills -->


#### Applying activity theory to surface contradictions and design tensions experienced by participants and facilitator/s

The followings sections use a process of analysis of contradictions between system elements of the activity systems outlined above. The processes is a formative intervention (explored in chapter three) in that the surfacing of tensions due to changes in the learning design over time are examined. As noted in the introduction, this chapter explores the following areas of contradictions: contradictions in the technical tool use of design, contradictions shaping the development of supporting documentation, contradictions to do with issues of identity and the cultural dimension of participation.

<!-- I chart the detail of the evolution of resources and other responses used helps illuminate broader, systemic issues concerns in the overall activity [@barab_using_2002]. -->




<!-- In the process of reflection on sessions I both observed and project tensions between activity system elements and between different scopes of activity. In response, I introduced new tools or processes or removed existing or potential barriers. I observed participants responding to tensions both in expected and novel ways. -->


<!-- As outlined in the table above I carried out four stages of workshops and development with home educator families. I will outline decisions behind the design activities at key stage of activity   -->

## Summative narrative description of evolution by phaser

I feel here a tension in communicating clearly and retaining some of the surprise of a narrative. I feel like this table tells the story too soon.  

A similar table in the previous chapter table of phases this one is about tool and documentation use in particular. For completeness and data replicability, and as a practice of openly sharing educational resources. A fuller table in the appendix links to different online versions of documentation and tools uses. All are free and as based on web standards are unlikely to decay, a process that unfortunately occurs too often, making replicating or even investigating out of curiosity the tools used in may studies impossible.

|--------|------------|--------------

## Contradictions involving the use of game programming and asset authoring tools

**Addressing contradictions arising in use of coding tool use and game asset creation - often experienced as more individual level**

<!-- In P1 I trialled brief class instruction of key coding concepts, e.g. logic statements, that I judged to be relevant to the whole group. Despite trying to limit the time spent on instruction, linking to their experiences and making the process informal, my journal notes reflecting on these interventions were unfavourable. Instead, I was keen to align with the motivational potential of hands-on (learning by experience) approaches to STEM education [@holstermann_hands-activities_2010]. -->

Activity theory has a broad definition of the concept of tool which in this context would include the use of language, concepts, supporting resources and production processes. While forms of documentation and supporting resources are explored in the following section, this section focuses on software tools and code framework used to create games in this program.    


### Situating tool use by phase

Insert table of tool use or link to this as an appendix.




### Narrative description of the area of contradiction
Contradictions arose between the need of participants to use key tools to create games and their lack of experience of them. Thus crux of the conflict is that coding games to create a webpage using a text environment is a complex process. In early stages, this gulf created a tension between the need to use the tools and text coding processes which often resulted in frustration and paralysis in the activity of game coding. While this is to be expected given the novice status of the participants, contextual factors complicate this contradiction further. For example, the process of helping participants build familiarity and competency in tool use was further complicated by my own motivations for working with as authentic as practical game authoring tools (explored in the introduction).

While, gaps in knowledge and practice are commonly addressed in formal learning environments through forms of instruction, the informal nature of this learning setting encouraged me to prioritise approaches which avoided written or to whole class instruction. My motivations here were also supported by experiences in P1 documented in my journal. I found attempts to convene attention on a presentation screen for instruction based teaching to class uncomfortable, stemming from my judgement that these interventions to be unwelcome interruptions for the participants making activities.  


The resulted in a design challenge involved designing a bespoke  game authoring environment by adapting existing tools and embedding where possible affordances within that toolset to facilitate participants to address gaps in their knowledge without needing explicit instruction. The following sections explore the evolution of the tool selection and the tool use of participants in response to this conflict in the game making activity system.

 <!-- namely: an incomplete 2D platformer; pixel graphics; with graphical scaffolding for text-based code; and deliberately incomplete thus inviting improvement. -->


<!-- As explored in the literature review, an extensive body of research on the design motivations and impact on learners exists for the creative coding tools Scratch.  -->

<!-- A common question for this research is why not use Scratch (see LR / Glossary)? While Scratch, is aimed a broad range of media creation, much of this research involves game making as a popular genre of media of young people. I chose to not use Scratch for this study, partly as it was well researched and partly to prioritise authenticity of tool set.   -->

<!-- I took care to screen participants from processes and tools that were unrealistic for novices to use. -->

<!-- NOTE - PERHAPS EXPLORE COMPLEXITIY OF IDES AS A BARRIER IN RESEARCH - SEE BLUE JAY AND GREEN FOOT TRAINING IDEs -->
<!-- In the activities of study, a high degree of authenticity made possible, in a material sense, by the digital nature of the learning resources. Beyond a general purpose computer, no prohibitive equipment is needed. -->



### Using a starter game template

FOCUS ON THE TENSION FIRST AND SHIFT FROM P1 -> P2

By P2, learners first experience of the experience of the tools was in the process of playing an incomplete game in a webpage and controlling the character using the computers arrow/ cursor keys which for many was a familiar process. Due to an intentional fault, players needed to click a remix button, and alter the underlying code to progress in the game. The following section outlines responsive design process surrounding two main elements: the starting game code template and the code authoring toolset.



The initial use of a working structural template was an intuitive response based on my own experience of teaching technology. The choice to pre-select a particular genre was initially a pragmatic response to tensions experienced in P1. When offering feedback to address her family's feeling of isolation from the coding process, the parent of the family described in part two of this section had more hands on play and use of the tools of production before being called on to make creative decision, likening this to an arts studio approach.

I realised that to allow for this playful experimentation, a purely structural template was insufficient and that a working game template was preferred. To create the template I drew on the structure of online starter templates from several sources  to create a minimal template for a two-dimensional platformer game.

<!-- The following section describes designs decisions relevant to the evolution of this starting template by drawing on concepts explored in the literature review, namely: UMC approaches; constructionist design heuristics; and the domain of human-computer interaction (HCI) research. In particular, I explore the concept of affordances understood from a socio-cultural perspective as 'technology affordances as possibilities for human actions mediated by cultural means' [@kaptelinin_affordances_2012, p.927].   -->

<!-- Creating the project from first principles is relatively complex both semantically and practically. In the domain of web technology, starter templates consist of pre-built collections of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other configuration files which allow users to avoid initial configuration and thus accelerate adding features to projects. For example the Next.js web framework comes with a large range of starter templates based on common requirements of web sites [@nelson_best_2023]. Phaser starting templates available from the website share this aim of providing scaffolding by providing a downloadable zip of files which when extracted are already interlinked correctly [^5].
While access to HTML and CSS files of the base project was available in the left menu as show in  by default participants would see only the JavaScript file names game.js .

Game states and functions to create the game loop (see glossary) are included natively in the phaser framework [@faas_introduction_2017]. Game states allow designers to deconstruct games and game code into collections of sub-units (states)   [@kostolny_digital_2017]. For example a simple arcade games may only had an insert coin state, a play state and a game over state. A game coding framework like phaser shields its users from code complexity by providing a game state manager and associated functions out-of-the-box, meaning that lots of underlying code is already written and hidden from view. To increase simplicity for my participants the starting template I created had only one game state called _PlayState_. It followed the following structure: a beginning section out side of a function declaring variables; a preload function which loads assets into the game; a create function which sets up the initial game; an update function which listens to and responds to user input. The following illustration from the step-based instructions illustrates the structure for participants, including the possibility to create new game states e.g. a game over state.

#### Variable editing for player movement

To accelerate and support the experimentation of users, I identified changes to the code that were easily recognisable game experience features and where small changes could provoke a high impact on the game experiences. These include changing gravity, altering the player jump height and walking speed.

The starting template began with the game in a broken state thus inviting players to modify the game to fix it. The player's maximum jump trajectory was not sufficient to progress via a jump to the first platform. To progress, participants needed to change alter at least one of the key variables were highlighted at the very start of the game code (see Figure above). In their research Kynigos and colleagues [-@kynigos_children_2018] explore this concept as a half-baked games where incompleteness or bugs in behaviour are a provocation to participants to correct or to further modify them. This process also aligns with the motivations and techniques of the UMC framework explored in the literature review , in particular the guideline to "create choices that show visible and immediate changes" [@lytle_use_2019-1, p. 6]. In this design, the first participant choice and the need to  transition from the _use_ to _modify_ stages is forced at an early stage by the half-baked design. While this design decision compromises the user choice initially, it allows a  carefully scaffolding of early coding experiences and promotes a shared experience for all participants in a way which facilitates and encourages peer learning. After this shared first change, participants next choices varied greatly. While some participants engaged with extensive experimentation to find a player movement feel that seemed just right, others, mostly adults or younger participants, were much less concerned with this aspect of game play, despite sometime frustrating resulting player movement. Data explored in the next chapter supports foundational claims of contructionist computing and UMC advocates  that greater user choice over the design process contributes to participant motivational and a feeling ownership of their projects [@lytle_use_2019; @peppler_computer_2009]

The process here began with me imagining what would be a good feature that players would notice and be spurred to change. Here, the deliberately unsuitable game variable is a key affordance of this half-baked game template. Descriptions of other key affodances follow (NOT GRAPHICS NOW? ADD A MENTION?).

<!-- Descriptions of three design techniques to the template to make quick modification of the game easier follow. -->
<!-- I adapted my design with an aim to increase speed and consistency of feedback from learner input, reduce coding syntax knowledge needed to progress, and thus reduce learner anxiety for novices.  -->

#### Simple block graphics

The use of blocks of text invited
Their size of 32 x 32 was also design to reduce friction in teh creative process as this was the default size of Piskel.

One of the complications encountered in P1 was the differing sizes of sprites created using different graphical tools. I helped resolve this for participants by matching the size of the block in the grid level design structure described above to the default size of sprites created in Piskel (32 x 32 pixels). This is one example of many small technical alignments which addressed and helped resolve practical obstacles that participants experienced.

NOTE - Make link with later section  

#### Level design and prototyping

**The use of a graphical grid structure to edit level design helped balance concerns of accessibility with the use of authentic code language.**

Platform games often conform to certain patterns in terms of the elements involved in a level and their affordances. Common elements include the player that you control to movement of, platforms to be jumped on, enemies to be avoided and rewards to be collected. In the templated used in P1 the process of adding game elements was involved relatively complex process which involved changing parameters of functions to alter to adjust their location. An example of the code needed is included one of my tutorial chapters / appendix 4.x [^7].

Complexities included: adding function parameters for screen coordinates which made it tricky for participants to intuitively place game elements where they wanted them; each element needs to be added separately; difficulties concerning adding graphical elements of different sizes; in addition for each element added different code elements needed to be added to three different functions in the code.

These complexities created barriers and frustrations into the game making activity at a stage which in P1 accumulated into a risk of participants giving up at worst or significantly reduced a participants experience of computational fluidity (as explored in the literature review) at best.   

The complexities outlined above are addressed in GUI oriented tools like Unity through the use of a concept called tilemaps [@erhard-olsson_procedural_2018]. This design choice allowed alignment with design principles for tools for novice coders, in particular the importance of visual approach to facilitate the programming multi-media projects for novices [@guzdial_programming_2004; @resnick_scratch:_2009]. While such an approach was possible graphical based tools like Scratch, this was in conflict with my motivation to use authentic, text-based tools.

In P2, I revised the starting template to created game elements was based on a visual design in a grid format (see figure 4.x below) which replicated some of the use of use of tilemap technique within the text code format. Changes to the text based grid in the code area on the left would be immediately seen in the right hand project preview area.

<!-- OPTIONAL ADD AND APPENDIX ON LOAD LEVEL? -->

![](./Pictures/grid_editor_1.png){width=95%}
Figure 4.x - Grid based editing of level design with a simple key for hazards, coins, and platforms.

This solution abstracted away complexity of asset placement to prioritise ease of use to help sustain participant engagement. Technically, this approach involves the construction of a data array for each level of 17 blocks which can be one of the following: x (platform); h (hazard); o (coin); or could be left blank (see Figure 4.x above). The end result was that while participants altered a text-based array, the grid structure had a strong visual correlation with the resulting game layout.  This adaptation had a positive impact on engagement with level design in initial stages. Many participants spending significant time and effort undertaking many iterations of changes to the level design. In the vignette in appendix 4.x referenced above, Toby designed many levels making the game very challenging but still technically possible. Participants varied in their approach to level design, some drew on their experiences to mirrors platform game conventions, while others enjoyed working against these conventions, a theme which is explored in more detail in chapter five.
DEVELOP THIS SOMEHOW.

Thus, here a technical approach helped resolve tension described above. Black boxing the process of adding assets via x,y coordinates and reducing repetitive process.


<!-- The vignette in the last chapter saw Toby's adding new levels to his game and undertaking many iterations of changes to the level design.  -->

<!-- The possibility of disturbing the syntax of the  of code in the array. When participant did this it provided a good opportunity for facilitators or parents to outline the importance of correct syntax of and to explain the code structure. -->



<!-- _Seeding narrative and art creativity_
As they had been guided to make a game on a broadly environmental theme, participants often redesigned sprites to games involving animals. The following image shows a whale as a player character and plastic bottles.

![](./Pictures/whale_1.png){width=50%} -->

<!-- MOVE?
The process of creating a pixel art characters and hazard involved using an online grid design tool called Piskel, creating an design of an appropriate size, saving, exporting as an image, downloading to the hard drive of the laptop in use and finally uploading and incorporating the image into the code project and linking using code syntax. -->

<!-- #### Creating a simplified and clear project structure

The following illustration from the step-based instructions illustrates the structure for participants.

![](./Pictures/overview_of_structure_cropped.png){width=95%}

4.x - Structure explained in Manual for P2 and P3

In P1, I found that as I worked with the learners to respond to their requests to add in new elements to the game, I was able to to reference different parts of the template and thus build their familiarity with the code.

At one stage I did a test of that process by printing out different elements of the template and asking them to complete them roughly in order as a jigsaw activity. The participants expressed surprise at how much familiarity they had built up with the code.
INSERT QUOTE FROM SU AND TOBY

Despite building familiarity with code, at this stage event simple game changes or adding new elements still required significant support.

### Design adaptations to facilitate novice use of a code playground

<!-- Self-contained so many things set up by default,
a default screen size, asset creation tools, online community, comments and friend section.  -->

Code playgrounds, as described in chapter two, are an online environment used to test, share or invite help from online users. My choice to use a text code environment risked maximising barriers to participation by not profiting from design decisions in specialist coding software to help novice coders (previously explored in LR). These elements include steps to reducing syntax errors, shielding complexity, facilitating community commenting, sharing, remixing and other forms of collaboration. Learning computer coding presents challenges in part due to unfamiliarity with and potential complexity of code authoring tools and environments [@guzdial_programming_2004]. To shed light on this conflict and to situate later findings, this section surfaces observations from my journal notes and video data on how participants responded the tools introduced and my design adaptations.

While the scope of this study is not on the micro-level of tool use, it is useful to collate some broad observations from my journal notes and video data on how participants used the new tools introduced.

#### Remixing and community inspiration

The literature review outlined that one of the key principles of constructionist approach is promoting community inspiration and interaction. In the Scratch community this is achieved through and extensive online community which encourages remixing, collaboration and peer review via comments [ @monroy-hernandez_cooperation_nodate; @cress_supporting_2016].

The shared community element on the other hand was quite different for glitch.com web playground tool due to its very mixed user base and range of different web based projects. In this learning design I took a decision to not promote this online community as a source of inspiration and code bases. Instead one code base was promoted. Sharing of ideas and inspiration did happen both on the playtesting of each others games and via incidental exposure to the online work of others. This happened as they shared log account details and thus when logging in to access their own work they would also see and have access to the code and graphical creations of others. I took advantage of this shared access in shared socThus  affordance ial and playful missions which are described later in this chapter.

#### Addressing code syntax errors

COMPRESS AND LINK TO ABOVE PARAGRAPH

Many software projects aimed at for novices use visual coding (block coding) approaches to reduce complexities of code use [@bau_learnable_2017; @resnick_scratch:_2009]. This process reduced possibilities for syntax errors (see glossary) and often provides a limited set of blocks to reduce complexity. While this approach not explored here for reasons previously outlined, there are some features of the glitch code playground which help. For example, the environment can detect the file type as javascript from the file extension and then uses a static analysis tool (linter) scan the code for signs of inconsistencies of code and syntax errors and highlight them [@tomasdottir_why_2017].

In glitch such code syntax errors are highlighted via a red dot provided a quick visual indication of where the error occurred. In addition if the user hovered over the dot would give an error message. In analysis of pair interactions, I frequently [how much from video data]  observed the non-coding peer notice and point out the red dot, thus preventing further errors.

ADD IN HOW FREQUENTLY THE PARTICIPANTS DID USE THIS.

DESCRIPTION OF MY INTERVENTION. At times when addressing code snags experienced by participants I would scan the code looking for the red dots and drawing attention to them.

If this was not helpful I would also use the console of the in-built developer tools of the browser [@collins_crossfire_2011-1].

<!--
MOVE TO LITERATURE REVIEW IF NEEDED

While block coding offers significant advantages (GL)in preventing syntax errors, in a comparison to text coding approaches, Bau and colleagues summarise the inherent disadvantages [@bau_learnable_2017]. These include: block coding can take of a lot of the users screen; making small changes to code can be tricker in blocks than text; block coding can complicate remote collaboration and version control; searching for code structures is simpler using text code. While these disadvantages are more applicable to more advanced users, they remain relevant to my general goal of working with an environment aligned to professional practices. -->


<!-- In the video data analysed, there were practically no extended blockages to undertaking work related to the use of this environment. While this study does not attempt to quantify this factor, the experience compares very favourably to my experiences of using and teaching coding environments. -->

<!-- In my design the tools set is distinct from tools like Scratch, Logo in that while those tools were designed to be self-contained, the use of a JS library in a web coding environment is more open-ended. -->
<!-- In my design, tools are more authentic and familiar in terms of using a professional framework and a web technology around which the internet browser is based on. -->
<!-- #### Creation and migration of graphical and audio assets. -->

#### Distributed vs. self-contained approaches to asset creation

A key element of game creation is the creation and management of graphical and audio assets. Many coding tools for novices provide a library of prebuilt assets and tools within the environment to alter or creation graphical and audio multimedia assets to facilitate and accelerate the creation of games and coding projects. While there are practical limits to the audio and graphical authoring capabilities of tools like Scratch [@payne2019music], such self-contained approached reduce possibility for compounding errors and complexity caused by the compatibility of file formats and migration and management of external asset files.

There has been extensive research supporting the motivational value of the ability for young people to bring their interests into multi-media creations via choice of assets and narratives [@kajamaa_digital_2018; @resnick2014give; @peppler_supergoo_2007]. In line with these findings, I observed a palpable a sense of achievement when participants succeeded in seeing and hearing their creations in their game after making the final changes in code. For some, the sense of a achievement appeared magnified by difficulty caused by the unfamiliar environment and processes.
EVIDENCE?

THE BENEFITS OF ASSET CREATION AS A WAY TO INCORPORATE FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE - WHERE IS THIS EXPLORED.

<!-- In Scratch there are tabs which host simplified graphical and audio studios. Design decisions prioritise ease of use and the ability to record audio right into the program.  -->

In P1 I observed participant showing a high motivation to incorporate assets. Responding to the enthusiasm of participants in asset creation, I had introduced six additional software tools to participants including tools for pixel art, sound editing, sound creation. A table of the different tools is included as appendix 4.x

A summative timeline is included as a diagram.

<!--
- Piskel - a graphical editor used to create pixel art sprite characters;
- Audacity - a desktop based application to record and edit audio using audio effects and filters like delay and echo;
- freesound.org - an open repository of audio files which could be downloaded, used directly or altered using Audacity;
- Sonic Pi - an education music application allowing the creation of music using text coding;
- Bfxr & jsfxr - web based tools to create sound effects aimed at game production;
- Scratch - while scratch was not use for game production, I encouraged participants to use its intuative graphical editor to create backgrounds for the game; -->

Similar patterns of use emerged. Participants would identify the need for an asset in their game. They would then use the separate software to create that asset, and the be supported to save assets to their computer's hard drive in a compatible format. They would then need to upload assets to the code playground environment, discover the text link of the asset, and then insert that link into the main JavaScript game file at the relevant line of code. Undertaking the full process involved learning a complex chain of these individual actions. Some participants became remarkably adapt at this, thus transforming this chain of actions into a fluid operation. Thus, the distributed nature of the toolset used helped build authentic digital literacy skills.

<!-- For example, the processes of replacing a block image with a bespoke pixel sprite which comprised: file downloading; file migration using the browser and file manager; browser tab navigation; graphics tool use in Piskel; copying and paste text code; and selecting more than one lines of text code with mouse or keyboard shortcuts. -->

Despite this benefits, I was concerned that in P1 the diversity of asset creation tools approaches was over complicated and risked distracting time and attention from other code-based actions involved in the activity of game making. Thus, in P2 I reduced the number of suggested assets creating tools.  

This tension can be described as a play paradox. WHERE IS THIS FIRST INTRODUCED I was looking to avoid too much time spent in asset creation at the expense of other processes which would develop coding concepts and practices. It also increased the possibility of peer learning as less tools were being used.

ALSO NEEDED TO CHANGE DUE TO THE CHANGE IN GROUP WORK DESCRIBED LATER.



##### Use of Piskel

START WITH SHIFT FROM P1 DIVERSITY TO P2 FOCUSED & OVERCOMING PRACTICAL BARRIERS.

<!-- Participants were keen to replace the default coloured block sprites of game elements with their own art of characters and backgrounds. From P2 onwards the one suggested tool to do this was the online Piskel tool [^8]. -->

A pixel art approach to graphics allowed a balance between the potential for positive engagement with game making and the potential drain of time to this one activity, thus helping resolve one of the tensions emerging in P1. Piskel had proved to be intuitive for many younger participants with three main areas: a set of editing tools; a canvas for creation; and a set of tools to export, save and import work (see Figure 4.x).

![](./Pictures/piskel_app_1.png){width=95%}
Figure 4.x - Interface of Piskelapp tool

<!-- One of the complications encountered in P1 was the differing sizes of sprites created using different graphical tools. I helped resolve this for participants by matching the size of the block in the grid level design structure described above to the default size of sprites created in Piskel (32 x 32 pixels). This is one example of many small technical alignments which addressed and helped resolve practical obstacles that participants experienced. -->

Participants spent a widely different length of time creating these graphics for a variety of reasons. Some took a long time to master the process of using the editing tool while others created images rapidly but would keep redesigning and recreating their game elements. The process of game art creation opportunities seeding narrative and artistic creativity is explored in more detail in chapter five.


<!-- I began by mirroring social model of learning like CoL and CoP and their propose apprenticeship-based approaches. Specifically, introducing possible code solutions to implement the ideas of participants. However, limits to my time involvement and my technical fluency hindered this process creating stress in myself and frustration and hesitancy on participants to get direct help.

    NOTE - Examples drop?
    For example, to troubleshoot a code error might take between one minute and 10 minutes depending on the complexity of it. To work with participants to identify and then implement a new coding structure could take up to 30 minutes.

    At times I was able to identify a discreet new code construct and to implement an example of this between sessions. At times I would attempt to do this in the group setting with varying results.

    Other interventions were called for directly by parents. Two relevant and relates requests happened at the end of P1.

    One was a call for more hands on play and use of the tools of production before being called on to make creative decisions. The parent likened this to an studio approach. Another was a request for additional supporting resources which explained the coding structures used in accessible but detailed ways. A request which hinted at a more structured, instruction based approach.

    However, interview data from participants placed great value on the flexibility of the approach which allowed participants to choose what they wanted to add to their game next. -->


<!-- Based on group work with adults on creating media projects together I created an email group that all participants could post to to ask for help. However this option was hardly ever used taken up. I was given feedback from one parent that asking on for technical help via an email forum not something that they felt comfortable doing. The same family also gave useful feedback about social norms of not bothering people getting in the way of asking for help.

Thus other ways of addressing this conflict were called for. -->

<!-- The need to get started somewhere emerged - and the template was a response to that.
Just an immediate, intuitive way to bring something to the table as a starting point to develop. The template was based on a prominent tutorial on the phaser website called Making your first game.

<!-- ### ORIGINAL SECTION
**Code Playground to overcoming lack of software feedback**

One design principle explored in the literature review [@resnick_designing_2013] in the use of creative coding tools was that of immediate feedback for participants. Code playgrounds provide such immediate feedback. For example, in the code editing interface of glitch.com shown in Fig 4.x, changes made to the code on the left section take immediate effect in the resultant game on the right side of the screen.

![Changes made to the code on the left section take immediate effect in the right-hand preview window](./Pictures/phaser_simple.png){width=85%}

The a game template served to remove technical barriers to getting immediate feedback and offered other affordances explored in the next section. -->

<!--
### Remixing and showcasing projects

REDUCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PARAGRAPH - NO REALLY STRONG DATA SO SUMMARISE TENSIONS

Another common feature of novice coding tools is the use of a gallery of creations, in a way which aligns with the potential for community-based learning strongly advocated by Gee and Ito [@gee_what_2003; @ito_hanging_2010]. The ability to easily remix community projects, supports the process of becoming familiar with, and using other projects or approaches as a base, thus supporting the use and modify stage of the UMC pedagogy (see glossary). Remixing also informs professional practice [@kotsopoulos_pedagogical_2017-1] in the form of distributed revision control tools such. A practice known as code forking.

As explored in the LT, Code playgrounds address issues of complexity of web coding environment and practices of forking by providing access to a self-contained server structure from within a browser. However for novice  users the web location still also offers friction in terms of digital literacy issues of logging in, remembering passwords, linking to email accounts for password reminders. To circumvent these issues in P2 and P3 all participants and facilitators used a shared account for code playground the graphics editor.

In this program, while participants where not encouraged to browse the creations of a wider web-based community, they were encouraged to view and interact with fellow participants projects.

Practically, in novice coding communities, this is encouraged by the use of community galleries and buttons encouraging. In Scratch this is seen in buttons named see inside and remix when viewing projects. Similarly both the Thimble (used in P1) and Glitch (used in P2 and P3) prominently featured remix buttons and view source buttons in the community interface. The shared community element on the other hand was quite different for glitch due to its very mixed user base and range of different web based projects. In this learning design I took a decision to not promote with existing online communities but to focus instead on internal sharing of projects between the group.

The process of adding a remix button, removes the needs for participants to copy underlying code by hand and set up the parameters of a new project.  This process is especially relevant in reducing barriers to initial participation given the use here of authentic professional text-based coding language and potential alienation from unfamiliar syntax and file structures.

This theme of shielding from complexity is contained in all design choices detailed above and in turn aligns with a constructionist design principle to 'choose black boxes carefully' [@resnick_reflections_2005, p. 119]. A black box here refers to the process of hiding away aspects or functionality of the code or processes. The decisions made in the design each tool shape the skills and concepts the end user is guided towards. While the principle here is applied to software tool use, it also applies to the use of a starter game template, as explored in the next section.

<!-- For example, the design choice in Scratch and Code.org sprite and game labs to create a default canvas screen size of the project. It is already present and visible on the creation of each new project and the user has no choice over the settings.  --> -->

### Observations on the game template and core tools

<!-- NOTE: FEEDBACK FOCUS from HCI & layer in AT terminology too.  -->


<!-- The templated game was structured to allow changes in code which were relatively easy to perform but which resulted in potentially large changes in game behaviour, appearance and difficulty. This created a large diversity in the games created and in the making activities of participants at this stage despite the small scale of the code changes involved.   -->
<!-- Thus while I highlighted a limited number key code elements and structures to create affordances to facilitate a quick start, the diversity of experience kept some participants extended periods of time. -->



<!-- Games have been part of humanâcomputer interaction (HCI) research since
the first CHI conference in 1982. At that gathering, Tom Malone, then at Xerox
PARC, presented insights from the study of computer games to motivate a set of
design principles for âenjoyableâ user interfaces (Malone, 1982).

from [@bernhaupt_introduction_2015]
 -->

The previous sections have outlined changes to the core tool use including the use of a starter game template which I enacted to address the struggles participants had in becoming accustomed to game making. Despite the relative simplicity of the highlighted affordances outlined above, complex and divergent patterns of design behaviour began to emerge. Small code changes resulted in potentially large changes in game behaviour, appearance and difficulty aligns with a long standing concept of HCI research that feedback is motivating for system users [@bernhaupt_introduction_2015; @malone_heuristics_1982]. In addition, the use of revised in starter template in P2 allowed participants to maintain their games in a mainly working, shareable state allowing regular feedback from peers. The use of a starting template was inline with core motivations of UMC technique, namely, to build familiarity with the code structure, and confidence in use of tools in an accelerated way. As explored above, the shift in template design from P1 to P2 involved a much more careful and structured experience for participants in use and modify stages.

Despite these modifications, participants still needed help to access and use the relevant affordances in code template. In early trials with a limited number of families in late P1, I would point out the relevant part of the code and ask open questions e.g. '_I wonder what would happen if you changed that gravity variable?_' However, for larger groups this was not optimal, risking leaving some unsupported. My response was to turn to supporting documentation. In addition, participants soon began to ask how to make modifications to the game which needed additional code structures, a development signifying a pivot to the _create_ phase on the UMC model. The next section explores similar tensions related to the role of supporting resources and documentation.  

<!-- My reflections as an facilitator are consistent with research showing the value of ongoing feedback in HCI and more domain specific research on showing the process of sharing creations are motivating thus. -->




<!-- At the use and modify stage, knowledge of very few coding concepts were essential. It useful to compare this to a typical process of learning to code in a text language from first principles where the learner is met with a great many new concepts in the process of being guided to construct even the most basic of programs.  Thus, while some basic alterations are being made, this stage of learning design aligns most closely with the _Use_ stage of the UMC model (see lit review/ glossary) [@lee_computational_2011].    -->


<!-- The partially working environment and immediate feedback this allowed also gave rapid access access to varied forms of face to face community activity including varied forms of playtesting and social interaction and ways to access help from peers and facilitators.
While Scratch has an extensive online community allowing for remixing and showcasing of games,  the community element of the design are not is explored in this section. See instead chapter six. -->
<!-- While, initially conceived as a starting activity, many learners stuck with those possibilities for a long period of time. -->



<!-- although help was available via in-line text code comments, I noted that to notice and read these comments required a degree of proficiency or code familiarity that not all participants had.
 -->

<!-- NOTE
MOVE? NEXT CHAPTER - ALSO NOT ALL PROGRESSED
A common request was to add a moving enemy to the game. There was a great divergence in the amount of time learners took to want to progress beyond making embedded changes to adding new game design patterns. One parent Molly did not progress beyond this point despite engaging in phase three and phase four, focusing on graphical design and developing narratives. In the feedback session she commented that she was happy to reinforce her existing learning. -->


<!-- While the template has self contained help in the form of text comments Some participant do not pick up all processes, some left behind and need support but that is available. Seeing patterns other peers adopted and creates a reason to ask for help. Peer propagation of patterns explored later. -->

<!-- Perhaps move later after GDP chapter?  -->
<!-- **Limitation of asset work as a GDP**

## Participant conflict associated with project navigation and use of documentation

**- Contradictions associated with project navigation and the use of supporting documentation - interpreted here through the lens of guided participation**


PERHAPS INCLUDE TIMELINE OF DOCUMENTATION IN HERE -
THERE IS AN EXTENDED TABLE IN APPENDIX 4.X

### Narrative pm the evolution of resources during P2

This section details a conflict where participants, frequently wanted to add new features or changes to their game but were not clear how to implement them. In P1 this caused delays and participant frustration, as although I could work with people directly to help them I had limited time with each participant or pair. The inability for participants progress due to lack of game and coding practices was compounded in early stages by little or no supporting documentation or supporting resources. This section outlines the evolutions and design choices informing the different forms of supporting documentation used to address this conflict.

<!-- Before addressing the detail of the learning design it is helpful to contrast both documentation with the use of tools and templates explored previously.   -->

The process of creating documentation which created enough support for users to be able complete coding tasks but also facilitated participants to choose their on path presented significant challenges.

MENTION HERE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY USE OF TOOLS DUAL STIMULATION?
SOME DISCUSSION MOVED TO CHAPTER 6 ALREADY - MOVE IT BACK HERE?

<!-- I wavered between the use of a technical variable name or one more closely linked to the behaviour in the game. For example, I trialled replacing velocity_x and y with playerMoveSpeed and playerJumpSpeed. I returned to velocity x and y as they are important concepts in physics and wider science, here prioritising the more abstract representation based on experiences of participants not getting overwhelmed or stuck on this use of language, quickly forming habits to alter them. I evaluated that more is gained than lost in this design choice. -->

<!--
![](./Pictures/quickstart_phaser_1.png){width=50%} -->

<!-- As outlined above the starter template and quick activities served to address the _use_ and _modify_ stages of the UMC approach. One seeded into the community, these processes also propagated via peer learning in ways which are explored in chapters five in six. In contrast, the _create_ stage required longer input from my self, to help participants with their individual choices of what to add to the game.-->

<!-- SHIFT? - It is notable that the create stage of this model does not involve starting a totally new game from scratch as is imagined in some interpretations of that model. Due to the complexity of the code base and framework the process of creating a new GDP within the game as a suitable level of challenge. -->

<!-- ##### Linear and stand-alone tutorials and code snippet resources -->

<!-- Longer form step by step tutorials are common in computing education. Examples can be found in Code Academy, and in the education resources of RPi foundation. Many examples talking learners through steps to build a game can be found online with varied amount of explanation of underlying constructs and concepts. I started my journey learning JS games using some provided
by Mozilla and the Phaser developers. -->

### Quick Start Cards

To address the limit of one-to-one facilitator support to seed the starting processes outlined in the section above, I used printable resources which highlighted the key lines of code and how they can be altered to impact on game behaviour(see figure 4.x below). These _quick start_ cards provoked a strongly scaffolded initial interaction with the code in a way strongly aligned with the use and modify stages of the UMC framework [@franklin_analysis_2020].

![](./Pictures/velocity_jscard.png){width=95%}
4.x - Example of a Quick start card

The quick start cares were created at the end of P1 by trainee computing teachers in my faculty who volunteered to support a holiday outreach event for young people. I developed them by theming them into starting level, next level and boss level. Participants were encouraged to pick a card based on their interest and difficulty level.  

### Code snippet examples

The use of code snippets, while a promising authentic practice, presented initial challenges. To support a hands-on approach and responding the design choices of participants, I began by creating discreet code examples illustrating the requested elements. The use of code examples or snippets in code playgrounds is a common professional problem solving practice [@yang_stack_2017]. These code examples allow users to see the behaviour in context with the code and output side by side. While code examples existed on the Phaser website and support forums, in line with other support sites like stack exchange, their utility has limitations including lack of relevant, consistency, being removed from the domain context, and not being structured in a self explanatory way [@treude_understanding_2017]. Thus, while I initially encouraged participants to search within these examples, and authentic documentation and help forums, the resulting confusion and difficulties experienced by participants, prompted me to create other more bespoke documentation.  

<!-- The competency to overlook the concrete differences in code structure to abstract the principles away and to then apply those principles to the existing structure of their code project seemed too ambitious for this group of novices. -->

Creating a bespoke set of code snippets helped address the challenges described above. In P1 I responded by creating one off documents with the relevant code which were both printed, emailed and shared via google drive. In line with the practice of accessing help via code snippets, the code examples could be to be copied and pasted into the game. This process lacked coherent process for participants to navigation to the resource they need. The process also lacked a consistency in signposting how the code listed fit within the existing structure. To help students see the code in the correct structure, I began to create code snippets within code playgrounds and distinct project. These projects shared the structure of starter game template and added only the code needed for the additional requested functionality. My rationale was that each pattern added builds familiarity with the code structure, a theory supported by observations of Toby's proficiency in the vignette above.


### Structuring instructional tutorial chapters

<!-- BELOW Initially I structured the book chapter participants working their way through the online resources. HOW -->

<!-- While writing self-contained tutorials added a challenge to the documentation authouring process, the documents, especially when printed became a vital resource for this community. In chapter 5 I explore the extent to which these resources can scale for use beyond this context. -->

For each code example I created descriptive step-by-step documentation which in P2 were developed into chapters of an online book [^9]. Each code snippet linked to a descriptive chapter. These chapters attempted to balance an informal, hands-on approach over pre-teaching concepts, with the request from some from parents in the feedback to P1 (see appendix 4.x) to provide background concepts and explanations of coding constructs. To address this tension, in addition to self-contained chapter focused on instrumental code changes needed to implement game features, I created opening chapters of the online manual which were more traditional in format and explained underlying concepts that the starting template had initially abstracted away from the participants.

<!-- As these tutorials took as a starting point the code of the starting template and did not attempt to explain that, they did not however resolve the issue of participants wanting resources that explained these core constructs and underlying concepts.

I created opening chapters of the online manual which were more traditional in format and explained underlying concepts that the starting template had initially abstracted away from the participants.  -->

<!-- To describe the relationship between the self-contained chapters described above and the process of backtracking to gain foundational knowledge, I used the term _meeting yourself in the middle_. In the supporting chapters this term represented the value of retracing initial steps as a way to explore the computing concepts present in the design. -->

<!-- An example of parent Sh interaction with long form tutorial follows. Sh engaged with the long form resources. While this process did not involve dialogue, the recording of her screen allows for a detailed description of how the resources was used.
Sh opens browswer to see list of code Examples, navigates to page, sees list of chapters, selects GDP pattern name, then follows along.
FIND THIS EXAMPLE AND WRITE IT UP / SEE WHAT IT ADDS TO THIS SECTION. -->

<!--
MOVE THIS TO THE NEXT BIT?
Interestingly, the online menus was not used by participants in any regular or consistent way. However, it did have a trickle down effect. Some trailblazing participants did either browse it, use it to try to solve problems or were referred to it my the facilitators. The patterns that those learners implemented were then remarked upon by other learners and sometimes adopted via peer teaching. -->

<!-- As explored in the literature review, it is difficult to explore this pedagogical approach relation to other similar programmes due to the lack of data on specifics of the learning materials presented to participants. -->


### Theming the a collection of game design patterns to aid navigation

<!-- **Tensions and related to navigation of various documentations sources** -->

<!-- The previous stage had created a variety of supporting documents and processes. However at the start of P3 I still had not managed to devise a system to communicate these options consistently and effectively to students. -->

<!-- Thus, there were two main ways of approaching adding a new pattern. One to examine a code example which was built around the same code base. This would involve searching for new code constructs and notes in the code designed to orientate the learner, alerting them to the location and purpose of the relevant code.

 It is this approach that we see the child Toby adopt in the vignette presented in this chapter. The second approach was to use the longer form step by step help.
 -->

Introducing documentation created additional tensions in the learning activity, specifically, I observed users failing or struggling to find the right resources online. This prompted me to design and introduce a themed hub for both snippets and tutorial chapters. My aim was to mitigate potential learner alienation from unfamiliar technical documentation through accessible design and to relating documentation to participants existing gameplay experience rather than underlying coding constructs. While time consuming, the process of aligning documentation, code snippets with more general concepts of game analysis, served to simplify the navigation of documentation. The guiding principle is that key affordances of the supporting secondary stimuli are designed to closely align with the objectives of leading activity at the predominant scope of activity.

![Pattern Collection](./Pictures/pattern_collection_1.png){width=95%}

<!-- For easy of navigation I also included the starting template and a link to the online book of step-by-step resources. -->
<!-- I addressed this by printing step by step tutorials. However the paper based resources did not allow users to copy and paste code, a  characteristic of online code examples and tutorials which facilitates quick progress. -->

<!--
In trying to organise and represent code examples to participants in a logical way, I experimented with different categories and themes to contains the emerging game elements. I also explored the concept of mapping the different challenges by difficulty on a map via structuring via concentric rings. An example of the kind of grouping sketch used is included below as Figure 4.x.  

![Scan of Journal Sketch of early attempt at dividing features by type and difficulty](./Pictures/pattern_types_sketch.png){width=85%}

_Fig 4.x. Scan of Journal Sketch of early attempt at dividing features by type and difficulty - Dated 11.3.2019_

The process of sketching, revising and re-sketching the elements led me to connect this process of categorisation with the work of game theorists. For example, I recognised synergies with between _open-world_ game design and my attempts to structure resources and help learners navigate the learning experience based on choosing challenges based on their interests and appropriate difficulty levels [@squire_open-ended_2008]. -->

<!-- NOTE SOME MOVED TO NEXT CHAPTER -->

INTRO SENTENCE

The process of theming the patterns has the potential to develop the community knowledge of game making concepts [@holopainen2007teaching]. In grouping the game design patterns into categories for the documentation hub page, I drew on academic and professional interpretations of game elements [@salen_game_2006; @schell_art_2008; @tekinbas_rules_2003]. Schnell's detailed analysis of tens of game elements presented as design lenses was too complex for this audience. Instead, I adapted a simplified introductory framework developed for use in youth-oriented Game Jams to help novice game makers hack/analysis and then adapt key elements of non-digital games [@cornish_game_2018].

- **SPACE:** Where the game takes place.
- **GOAL:** What is the objective of the game? What are you trying to do?
- **COMPONENTS:** What are all the objects or actors in the game?
- **MECHANICS:** What actions take place in the game. What are the verbs involved?
- **RULES:** What can or canât you do in the game? What defines boundaries? Does play happen in real time or do you take turns?

The framework youth game jams and in the Q2L school to help participants develop their implicit knowledge of game design concepts in to explicit share vocabulary before engaging in digital making via collaborative analysis of common games [@cornish_game_2018; @institute_of_play_gamestar_nodate]. Similarly, in early stages of my design participants completed a similar activity after playing retro arcade games [included in appendix].

I related this simple categorisation the emerging list of requests for game features made by my participants.

| **Game Mechanics**| **Game Polish** | **Game Space** | **Challenge Systems**|         
|--------|------------|--------------|----------|
| Jumping on Enemies  | polish. |  New levels | New levels |


This categorisation, while simplified, is consistent with professional and technical frameworks popular in game making communities including: the MDA framework [@olsson2014conceptual] (which focuses on analysis of games based on the user experience), Elemental Tetrad [@schell_art_2008], and DDE [@korn_design_2017]. The theme of using technical frameworks in an accessible way to facilitate the creations of novice participants is continued in the chapters five and six.  


<!-- I noted that some patterns addressed game aesthetics (simplified to  _game polish_) for example; the graphical representation of game characters; adding sounds; and adding background images. Others could be described as _game mechanics_ including: jumping on enemies; finding a door or flag to progress to the next level; and collect all food before progressing to next level. Others concerned aspects of _game space_: the size and shape of game world; and adding new levels the game. In P5 I extended the scheme to included  _system and challenge_ patterns. These explore at how different elements interact to create challenge in the game. -->

<!-- I then took the existing list of game elements that have been identified by students and categorised them based on a blend of two frameworks. -->

<!-- I made some simplifications and adaption to increase accessibility for non-professional and young people. For example, the term of aesthetics is very wide and suited simplification _game polish_. -->

<!--
My journal notes see an evolution of attempts to try to build into the program, activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers or more generally digital designers. In and early tentative attempt to define in broad strokes the types of game maker behaviour and underlying goals. In doing this I have taken inspiration from Bartle's game player types Hamari and Tuunanen, 2014). I translated player types to maker types based on notes in my observation journal and extracts from screen capture data. The following list of *Game Maker *types:

 -   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
 - **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
 -   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
 -   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other userse positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you. -->




## Responding to tensions and barriers in cultural aspects of the game making activity




**Narrative summary of conflict:**

### Design narrative on conflict due to identity clashes and dysfunctional group work

<!-- **Participants stuck / demotivated : scope of ambition to high,  clashes of identity not hard core coders, no on-going playtesting, collaboration groups too big (transition),** -->

<!-- In an early crisis point, one of the children  was not able to implement a desired feature as the 3D experience was beyond the technical possibilities of the code framework. -->
MAKE MORE OF THE P1 -> P2 SHIFT AT START



#### Shift from p1 - p2 -  


This experience aligns with research in this area explored in the literature review which explore pedagogies to address barriers concerning identity and technology-driven practices [@kafai_constructionist_2015-1]. These contradictions involved accumulating tensions which resulted in families feeling anxiety and alienation from the group coding environment and associated peer working dynamics. My journal notes see an evolution of attempts to try to build into the program, activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers or more generally digital designers. These are detailed later.

I illustrate this conflict using the experience of one family who withdrew from P1 three weeks before the end of the programme. While members of this family were able to engage in planing via sketching on paper and in creating pixel art, in later stages they were reliant on others to implement code changes. The freedom of choice and imagination allowed by designing on paper and via pixel art created compounding tensions. One crisis point involved a frustration of a child who was not able to implement a feature they wanted to add to the game next. A 3d bee design roaming a 3D landscape. I encouraged personal expression for the purposes of engagement and motivation. However, here it can lead to conflict and frustration as the desired changes of the child were not realistic to the technical scope of the project. The previous section explored the use of two dimensional (2D) platformer game as a technical template in P2. I also addressed participant expectations of an acceptable project scope for our timeframe as a non technical process.
<!--
When the family withdrew, in my journal notes I reflected that the they shared of alienation from the group process occurred in a session where, due to a sense of urgency to complete games, I had omitted drama-based warm up activities. Instead as participant entered I began to support to help some participants debug some pressing code errors. -->

When the family withdrew, they shared in feedback (see appendix 4.x) the moment that decided their withdrawal. that at one point they "looked around and just saw people doing hardcore coding and no longer felt that they belonged". In the end stages of the game production process, due to the dynamic of the larger group, they were reliant on others to implement code changes for their imagined game, unable to contribute fully at this point and found themselves isolated. Thus a contributing factor to this families alienation were tensions engendered by the large group size and compounded by frustrations stemming from unfamiliarity with tools and processes. In participant feedback, the  parent of this family described in the previous section indicated that it took too long before in the planning stage and called for more hands on play and use of the tools of production before being called on to make creative decisions. The parent likened this to an arts studio approach. This feedback contributed to choices outlined in other sections of this chapter. (WHICH ONES)

Some barriers stemming from alienation from participant group working processes were resolved partly by freeing up some patterns of collaboration and interaction and removing others.

The process of parents getting in the way of children's not minding jumping in and invading social space struck me. Together with the frustrations of complexities of larger group work the restrictions created a tension between the suggested community norm of how division of labour was organised.

Thus in P2, rather than the larger groups of P1, smaller groups, allowing some children to work by themselves and others with parents. Avoiding large group fragmentation and encouraging freedom of participation vs benefiting from parental involvement.

P2 introduced some of the changes
- Keeping games working to allow for less frustation - this promoted more playtestin time. explored next.





<!-- Based on my previous teaching experience, analysis of literature and knowledge of platform games, I pre-prepared a set of coded example and tutorials to implement a range of game design patterns. -->

DROP - COMPRESS - CONCLUSION?
The incident lead me to greater reflection on ongoing measures needed to prevent participant drop out for due to cultural tensions and negative affect to the working community. These include:

-   An awareness of the danger that those more confident in coding create more involved code problems that need more facilitator time, potentially making others feel less valued.
-   A concern for the fragility of learners positive affect towards the group game making process and thus the need for initial playful starting and closing activities to be continued beyond initial sessions.
-   The value of a stronger buy-in by participants, ideally a greater commitment to the collective making process balanced with the need for low pressure (avoiding a negative sense of obligation).



<!-- **Participants stuck / demotivated : scope of ambition to high,  clashes of identity not hard core coders, no on-going playtesting, collaboration groups too big (transition),**

For some families and individual participants there were conflicts to do with a sense of anxiety and alienation from the group coding environment and associated peer working dynamics.

One family dropped out and in their exit interview they shared that at one point we looked around and just saw people doing hardcore coding and we no longer felt at home in the environment. In this emergent design, they had mostly completed asset design and narrative development and the only coding remained. I thus wanted to address the tension between completing the project and alienation from just coding.

The value of playfulness is illustrated with one exit interview with a parent where they shared their reasons for leaving the program. At one stage after a week where they had missed a session, their family looked around and saw other groups involved in 'hardcore coding' and no longer felt at home. They compared this previous sessions which had more fun and group oriented activity.

I was struck that his incident happened during a session where I had not played customary drama games to create an inclusive environment. The games had been omitted as I was responding to a sense of urgency coming from families to solve problems. The scarcity in facilitator time drove me to crack on supporting families to debug code errors. -->

### REMOVED
COMPLETELY REMOVED SECTION ON PHYSICAL MAPS

### Playtesting as a cultural process

As explored in the literature review, playtesing is a process common to game making which corresponds to the evaluation phase of design thinking cycles.
BE SURE TO CHECK THAT IT IS!

By the time video data recording started in phase three there were already complex patterns of playtesting underway. In this section, I review data to describe some of the emerging playtesting behaviours of participants.

In journal notes, I observed that the shift of process from a more open creation in p1 one to the use of a _half-baked_ templated greatly increased the amount of time participants spent playtesting their own and other games. This is implicit in the process of starting from a broadly functional game.  

NOTE - can support or discussion based on the research on UMC  [-@lytle_use_2019-1] or that of half baked games [@grizioti_game_2018-1] be of use here. As a facilitator I would note my own concern if errors compounded to make the participants game unplayable for any extended time.  

Participants, particularly older ones, used playtesting as a way of showing support for fellow game makers. Example behaviours included: praising graphical content; making links with home interests of participants through questioning; and building rapport.

Molly in particular used playtesting to show her appreciation of the graphical work of others especially in the creation of cute animal characters. In response to one game which featured an image of a dog, other participants asked: _Do you like dogs? Do you have a dog at home?_.


#### Playtesting and embodied participation in the games of others

<!-- By the time phase three and video capture of data was underway, the process of playtesting began to take on interesting characteristics for some younger participants who were working more independently. -->
<!-- Because these interactions were mobile between works is it hard to transcribe interactions. However, description of the physical movement and gestures of the young people is relevant to explore the value of this behaviour which I will call playful playtesting.  -->


 <!-- Examples include.... -->
Some children added additional playful elements to playtesting. Because these interactions were mobile between works is it hard to extract audio and transcribe their speech. However, it is possible to communicate the characteristics of this play via a description of a typical encounter and the gestures of participants.

WATCH MORE CLOSELY AND TRANSCRIBE GESTURES

    Play is initiated by calling across the room as an invitation to play, or as a provocation. When playtesting is underway it is normally undertaken with two or three participants standing around the computer rather than being seated. The core of those involved take turns to play the game, exclaiming frustration or triumph at completing levels or failing. Failure may be extremely performative with a rapid pulling way from the screen and keyboard. This may be followed with a battle to wrestle control of the keyboard to play the game next. This may involving playful pushing, and wrestling of hands and arms and vocalisations. While this play is happening it may attract other participants who remain on outskirts of the activity looking on able to watch what is happening on the screen and respond non-verbally with smiles or laughs.

These changes to the form and function of playtesting by young participants is another example of expression of agency by participants that widens the scope of possibility of actions.

<!-- There may have been a response to draw in one of the younger participants who had on parent partner and who was brought along by another parent. -->
<!-- NOTE - Nadine's play on secret missions mirrors some of her more spontaneous play in the previous phase - thus one informs other -->


The process of play testing as a cultural process is explored in more depth in chapter six.


#### Local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community

There is convincing research on on how online community  can engender feelings of agency and motivation . FIND THIS - ROQUE AND ITO AND GEE. Thus, a possible question to level at the evolution of this design is why not engage with online communities as a form of authentic audience and as source of feedback as explored in the Scratch and New Grounds community websites.

A primary concern here were the time consideration of the process of being involved in an online community may remove time spent doing real life playtesting. Also there is a danger that, the diversity of creations available on a online community  could remove the more communal experience of the designed limitations.

More pragmatically, in this situation the use of a more professional framework, and a lack of dedicated site run for children reduced the scope for this kind of interaction.   

### Shift to P3 Drama process and what kind of Maker are you

By the end of p2 most of the tools and main processes were in place.

But I still felt tensions around introducing reflective processes and wanted to de-centre myself where possible from a teacher position.

The full process and rationale and initial reactions are detailed in appendix 4.x . In summary,

After the process I then proposed that there different game maker types and asked participants to evaluate and discuss with peers what kind of game maker they were. From the following list.

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users



This simple question "What kind of game maker are you?" - is a good indicator to others that you are trying to create a space where different approaches are possible and celebrated.

I incorporated it into an animation of the resources home page.

      â¢ Make a game about a big or small problem for your planet to solve. If you can let us play it each week as you go along.
      â¢ Give us an update each week by recording a group update.
      â¢ Show you can work on your own but also work as part of a team.
      â¢ We will also send you text messages with some mini-missions sometimes. Be sure to tell us how you do.

    Please now get started and come up with a new game about solving a problem on Earth.

_Extract from Appendix 4.x: Vignette of introduction of the drama process_

The process of introducing a scenario for participant to respond to is common in project based learning in this vignette. Here it is extended using a dramatic element in line with Heathcote on Mantle of the Expert (MoE) and other process drama techniques (explored in Lit Review). The following section outlines key characteristics MoE [@aitken_dorothy_2013] in context.



**_Contracting into drama_**

As a facilitator, I indicate that we are entering a dramatic process and attempt to draw everyone into a commitment to the process. The collusion is noted by both parents and children in recorded exchanges. For example, after engaging with a code example provided by myself in the role of the aliens, one pair make the following comment.

> Parent: Look, this is what Mick's showed, what Mick's has done.

> Child: The Weean have done!

> Parent: The Weean, sorry yes.

<!-- NOTE - LIT summary? opening a space for agency / change of roles  -->

_Facilitator activities in role_

My role is a link between the participant and the fictional commissioners of the games. The transcript in appendix 4.1.a details an example of extended facilitator input as instruction. As a practitioner in this setting, I had tried to limit teacher instruction and to outline boundaries to prevent learner disengagement. However some input was needed to help address the previously explored tension choice with over-ambition, and signpost participants to needed documentation. The drama narrative helped resolve some of this personal tension by allowing me using the dramatic commission as a foil to help avoid the encounter feeling personally controlling [heathcote_drama_1985].
CLARIFY - EXTERNALISING LIMITS TO ACTIVITY

<!-- NOTE - support with lit? also is this one tension or two  -->

_Learner activities in role_

Beyond the wider fictional frame of the making activity, learners were also sometimes asked to undertake some activities in role, in particular reflection in role. This and other example are explored via vignette 4.1.b.

<!-- There is more evidence of the impact of the drama process in the vignette above. In the end of session reflection, Richie occupies a peripheral position and continues to interact with his laptop. However, he reacts positively when Ed's questions to the Weean are read out. He later adds to the discussion when it turns to the sabotage based missions set in the drama process. It is probably that the ability to represent his irreverent approach helped his participation in the more formal, collaborative reflection and feedback activity in a way that had not happened in previous sessions.


One key activity that was carried out in role in P3 was end of session reflection. -->

<!-- IS MORE DESCRIPTION NEEDED HERE. ? -->

Vignette 4.1.b  illustrates this  process. In the extract participants are invited to take turns showing their game, recapping their progress and outlining next steps to the alien observers. I play the role as a liaison facilitating the process for the fictional, remote audience. I also draw attention to the secret missions that had been distributed to participants, which along with social missions are explored in the following section.

<!-- Choices

<!-- Something like the social activity of Vignette Sh and Th - perhaps even that one - as it goes on to

<!-- I first encountered these kinds of secret missions in a session which explored game design theory via creating a game collaboratively. [^1] -->
<!-- The secret missions were part of this workshop

#### Use of side missions to encourage varied creative practices

<!--
Perhaps add back in as an unintended consequence?
The live chat process started unintentionally as one child was left to their own devices as a parent was undertaking a social mission (see below and previous chapter). -->

One of the activities that participants carried out within the frame of the drama process was the undertaking of side-missions. These missions encouraged community-focused patterns of behaviour which I had observed in previous iterations of game making and via the game on playing and making types described above. These were activities not directly related to game making process. They were designed to encourage the exploration of the games of others, to encourage a playful approach. I had identified these behaviours as potentially helpful in maintaining the positive affect and identification with the on-going group process of game making. An extract of the table of both social and secret missions follows (a full table is available as Appendix 4.x). These mission were printed out on cards and one of each type was given to the participants in the first half of the first two sessions.

<!-- In the transcript above of vignette 4.1.b we see that in the end-of-session reporting back participants engage in a lively discussion about the secret missions they had been given. Encouraged by her mother Molly, Nadine shares that she has been highly engaged in a disruptive secret mission. Dan and Toby express playful frustration. Mark and Ed contribute by sharing their more subtle disruption and Richie is keen to have his _rude noise_ mission noticed and commented on. Some public missions had a noticeable impact in this session particularly in  stimulating a discussion among parents around which arcade games they played as youths. -->


These activities were undertaken by most of the participants. In analysis of one key sessions involving missions from which the transcript was taken. Out of 10 participants, 8 visibly engaged with the secret missions during the session.

<!-- PROVISIONAL BRING accurate FIGURES TO THIS. -->

The process was not without friction.  While the some of the secret missions encouraged forms of disruptive play, griefing of playing against the game [@bakioglu_spectacular_2008; @bartle_hearts_nodate]. While this increases engagement for some learners, the process also suffered the danger that participants transgress levels of cheekiness and play which explores boundaries, to more disruptive ones. In this context this involved frustration and wasted time for other users. After initially engaging with the process of secret games, Toby and Dave, who were later working on a tricky coding process, expressed frustration at interference.

Thus, while promising, limits to this process should be evaluated to avoid overly disruptive behaviour which create barriers to progress. For example, time limits could be in place.  

<!-- Side missions or side quests are also used in open world games are used in part to appeal to different kinds of players and are often models on Bartle's taxonomy of game player types [@bartle_hearts_nodate]. In this phase, parents Molly and Mark both used the prompts of the social missions to take a break from their creative work using the software toolset to talk to other parents and children.  -->



<!-- Mark: Right weâve got a background in. Do you. Do you want to reply to the Weean.
Ed: Yes. (Ed starts to type very slowly)
Mark: (after some time) While you do that Iâm going to go do my mission.
Ed: What's your mission?
Mark: To find out about other people's favourite games.
Ed: Alright. -->

This chapter makes limited claims in terms of the effectiveness of this process due to limits in terms of data gathering. However, it can make a claim that this activity has significant potential.
HOW EXACTLY?

In summary, this activity helped addresses one of the key barriers to taking part in a coding community that of alienation from the culture of coding. The use of missions introduced by facilitator are taken up voluntarily by participants and aimed to address conflicts caused by identity clashes by recognising and encouraging diverse making approaches and styles of community participation.

The positive reaction of young people to the drama process was also picked up in interview data.

    Mark: Tell us about the Weean?
    Ed: er.
    Mark: What did you like about the Weean?
    Ed: Just very silly and I don't know. They answered your questions.
    Mark: Was it, because there was a sense of play, a bit of fun and a bit of anarchy.
    Ed: Yeah.
    Mark: What else can you tell us about the Weean?
    Ed: er.
    Mark: There was the little sabotage things you had to do as well.
    Ed: Yeah
    Mark: So you liked those games where you had to kind of hack somebody else?
    Ed: Yeah
    ...
    Mark: The Weean thing was, I think, a massive hit for everybody because it just brought sense of play and fun. And it took attention away from it being overtly technical. Brought a personal element in and obviously that anarchy. Kids love the absurd.


<!-- While not all participants engaged with written tutorials. The next chapter explores the process in more detail from the perspective of a participant wanting to implement a particular game design pattern. -->

<!-- This observation is supported by research which encourages varied approaches in addition to instruction-based approaches [@dietz_design_2021; @resnick_coding_2020].

#### Observations on written interactions with the alien in the drama


As previously explored, an emerging area of tensions that I noted in journal notes and in feedback from participants was the area of supporting documentation and resources. In addition to the careful technical and pedagogical creation and organisation of resources undertaken in P2, I sought a way for participants to be aware of and access relevant documentation without interrupting their creative flow or the fun of the experiences.  

In P1 I created a mailing list for participants to ask technical and code questions of the wider group. My aim was to create a peer community helping each other rather than a helping relationship only between myself and individuals. However, this email list was hardly used for this purpose. Two parents shared that they were reluctant to bother other participants with their own issues. To address this in P3, as part of the drama process, I encouraged participants to write to the aliens to ask help. This is described and illustrated in appendix 4.x.

As well as exploring documentation and accessing technical help within the drama frame, student also engaged in playful dialogue with the aliens unrelated to game making. The process of asking the aliens for technical help within a code project sparked a playful process of informal chatting with the aliens. This chat began to fulfil a function of building  insider rapport, creating a fun atmosphere, celebrating the completion of games in the absence of a public showcase, and signposting the achievements of other participants.

The process started with supportive and celebratory messages posted from the alien. The impact was significant with the young people with 5 out of 7 engaging by writing messages and all mentioning the interactions verbally during the session.
<!--
To do this in a way that encouraged other participants to join in, I created a project in the shared coding project area with a webpage that could be edited and viewed by participants. When in the vignette 4.1.b Mark asks "Weâd like to ask the Weean some more questions (to overcome coding blockages), is that the best way to do it?", he is referring to this project webpage. The process of writing down a text request encourages the adoption of professional practice of asking a written question to overcome a coding problem and thus builds experience of using technical terms. Undertaking it in-role potentially addresses the barrier of asking for help by de-personalising the process.

Dan and Toby also received written help from the aliens to implement a pattern of creating random movement in their pac-man clone game. For this pair, the process of following a code suggestion from the aliens gives the parent opportunity to deconstruct the code in detail to explore coding concepts. In later discussion, Dan uses the fiction of the alien when asking a clarifying question.

    "Mick, do you think the aliens would mind if we get rid of the switch statement and replace it with some if-thens? They're just showing off these aliens aren't they?"

Here the text dialogue with the aliens is used as a mediating artefact first by the facilitator to share help in-role, and then by a parent to suggest a modification to the code syntax to create more readable code structure for novices.  

While this aspect of the drama process was introduced by the facilitator, in alignment with the understanding of Sannino's concepts of transformative agency through double stimulation (TADS) participants transform the function of the alien conversation to their own purposes. This theme is developed in the next section. -->
<!--
_Playful dialogue with the aliens unrelated to game making_

The process of asking the aliens for technical help within a code project sparked a playful process of informal chatting with the aliens.

This chat began to fulfil a function of building  insider rapport, creating a fun atmosphere, celebrating the completion of games in the absence of a public showcase, and signposting the achievements of other participants. For some pairs, while the child interacted in the live chat, parents performed final tweaks to code projects and challenges. Two parents in particular worked hard debugging more complex elements of the game with facilitators and peers. Other parents engaged with the chat and encouraged their children to get feedback from the aliens about their game in particular.

The process started with supportive and celebratory messages posted from the alien. The impact was significant with the young people with 5 out of 7 engaging by writing messages and all mentioning the interactions verbally during the session. -->

<!-- During in our end of session reflection above, I noted the following ad-hoc encounter that a child initiated on the interactive page while his father was taking a break from coding.

    Ed: hi WEEAN what is it like up there :)
    Weean: It is cold and very big but quite tranquil too.  all the same.
    Ed: What is your name?
    Weean: We are are the Weean we have no name, we are all the same.

<!-- Inspired by the positive reaction of participants to this playful engagement with the fictional audience, I asked a student helper to participate remotely to play the part of the alien. The student then gave feedback via live text interaction to participants in the final session. The process started with supportive and celebratory messages posted from the alien. The impact was significant with the young people with 5 out of 7 engaging by writing messages and all mentioning the interactions verbally during the session. -->

#### Concluding remarks on process drama


While inspired by the work on Heathcote on Mantle of the Expert, not all element of the process align directly. For example, the drama does not try to position the participants as expert game makers in a professional context.


This section has explored the use of the possibilities of a drama process to support both the leaner expression of agency and as a pedagogical process for facilitators to militate probable conflicts and obstacles for learners in the creative process. The mission-based interventions began as naturally occurring expression of learner agency which became incorporated into the drama process.

<!-- The next section examines the affordances and impact of the coding environment and starting game template, which in a similar way, evolved in response to participant use of earlier iterations of the toolset. Conversely, examples of more unguided practices and use of tools which served to increase the scope of agency are explored in the final section of this chapter. -->

The impact of time pressure to finish games also compounded tensions involving shifting away from game making to reflective activities. Even with the use of reflection in role, reflection activity was not prioritised in final sessions as time drew short.

This aligns with existing research addressing the barriers to effective reflection and meta-cognition on PBL processes.

While the 3M design is more limited than a Scratch media project in the potential to incorporate home interests, participants did embrace existing immediately clear possibilities offered by the certain GDPs in the 3M starting design.

The incorporation and design of game assets is taken as work on GDP for the purpose of this model.

The core GDP involving game assets already exist in the starting template.
- Objects as a reward to incentivise player exploration
- Objects as a hazard penalising player progress

NOTE - MOVED A SECTION ON THE EMERGENT DESIGN TO METHODOLOGY

<!-- As an example the quick start activities created by PGCE students were much more directive than I would have proposed. However, the response of participants still engendered a diversity of experience, from these shared beginnings.The implementation of discreet but potentially shared game elements became a shared pattern of activity. In early stages the mutual work to produce resources, techniques and practices to share and evaluate these shared elements became a primary focus of my work, just as the implementation of game elements was the focus of the work of participants. -->

In summary, this chapter has explored the complexity of the interacting tools and documentation in relation to their authenticity and impact on participant experiences. While the use of authentic tools and processes, while challenging for novices, can be facilitated by careful alignment of key design principles. However, some barriers involving social and cultural factors suited interventions of other pedagogies. In later chapters I explore the interaction between authenticity and agency in more depth using the emerging pedagogies as an analytical lens.

<!-- Later, chapter six  chapter explores the potential for drama processes to address learner anxiety in this domain. -->

### Summary of barriers and tensions explored in this chapter





The following summary table lists barriers and tensions drawn from the literature review that were significant when reviewing my journal observations, feedback from participants and video data. The purpose of this summary is to help recap and ground the reader before exploring the experiences of participants in more detail in chapters five and six. It focuses on use of tools but also signposts some social and cultural elements.

<!-- NOTE Perhaps linking to appendix. -->


| **Barrier / Tension**| **Description** | **Related Intervention**         
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Alienation from culture of computer coding  | As outlined in literature review.     |  Use of games, play testing and other social approaches. Explored in chapter six |
| Unfamiliarity with group project management  | Tensions arising through group miscommunication in P1     |  Avoiding large groups from P2 onwards, and starting with a half-baked game template which individuals or pair used as a base. |   
| Unfamiliarity with language and syntax   | Example: Javascript use of punctuation especially in arrays and in the structuring of functions. |  Use of UMC pedagogy and quick start examples to build familiarity  |
| Unfamiliarity with coding concepts   | Example: the use of if statements and global variables  | A starting template with much of the needed code in place, facilitator explanation when concepts are met in-situ, supporting documentation to reinforce previous experimentation   |
| Lack of direct knowledge of game making conventions and experience of game analysis  | e.g. common game programming patterns    |  Games and activities to access and surface tacit knowledge, use of a structured GDP collection to reinforce concepts |
| Tension between pre-choosing game genre and allowing for flexible choice of participants   | Example of the family wanting to make a 3D exploration game, but my in ability to support that   |  Introduction of the templated 2D platformer in a half-baked stage to create an engaging first impression, and ability to quickly personalise the game to increase participants' feelings of ownership over it|
| Tension between teaching the programming of game states and the complexity it introduced  | e.g. play state, settings page, welcome screen, game over screen    |  Introducing one state in the game code thus allowing extension, but not drawing attention to it |
| Tension between engagement value of providing a wide range distributed we production tools and complexity and disunity it induced   | e.g. move from diverse tools used in P1 to one raphical editor and one audio tool in P2  |  Restriction prioritised to encourage group work, as engagement was already high |
| Tension between the use of professional coding tools which increase authenticity at the prices of greater learning curve in adoption  | While suitable open source tools exist, they need careful curation by facilitators to reduce cognitive load    |  Design of template to surface key affordances to mitigate barriers to use and start usage patterns.   |
| Tension between producing extensive and varied documentation to support the different design choices of users and the increased complexity of navigation of the learning experience this brings  | The process of finding and following documentation was patchy   |  Resources were provided in a menu form linking to both code snippets and instructions |


Different areas of contradictions between different elements in activity systems emerged in journal notes and retropective analysis of evolution of the design. Some blockages were non-technical including hunger or grumpyness between participants, others were due to lack of access to the right tools or understanding of processes, others were particular types of coding error. I propose that more granular understanding of different kinds of design blocks can help facilitators and ultimately learners in building agency in their response to them.

*Additional tensions to integrate*

There's a tension of not wanting to jump in to teach CT concepts, or to force reflection on progress. Understandable not to want to interupt flow. It is not needed in terms of testing or curriculum here. This is an adaption where I project into the experience of participants and pick up on reluctance to step away from the ongoing coding and creative or playful tasks at hand. I adapted to end of session reflection on most sessions. I also did not draw attention to extra resources outlining formal frameworks. Although step by step instructions which did outline them in situ were available.
Here I worked to remove barriers to accessing CT as a framework via resource creation which aligned to experience. But their agency is expressed through disinterest and reluctance in participation. This transform conceptions of the activity as I give up CT as a framework which guides the objective. Instead using GDPS as one more aligned with their interests and need to develop fluency in non-conceptual coding practices.

Also, the drama frame was able to address of of the tensions which emerge - but these are mention only in summary here as they are explored in more depth in discussion in chater six.

#### Exploring dimensions of these barriers through the lens of agency and authenticity

Focus on agency.
And springboarding to the next two chapters.

<!-- NOTE IS THERE OBVIOUS SPACE FOR THIS OR SOMETHING TO SURFACE IN Discussion -->

Some barriers outlined were addressed in a way which created adaptions to the design which facilitated participation by making the process more supported. These include ; unfamiliarity with coding concepts,

The adaptations of to these tools can be conceived of as increasing instrumental agency by removing the need to understand concepts or use tools which were beyond the skill level of the participants.

Other tensions were resolved with more fundamental shifts to the overall structure of the activity which can be said to align more closely with the concept of transformative (authorial agency)  agency. IS THIS TRUE - NOT MUCH IS IN THE TABLE ABOVE - WHAT ARE EXAMPLES?
EXAMPLES ALIGN BETTER WITH EMERGENT USE OF GDP CODED IN NEXT CHAPTER - SO PERHAPS CONTRAST THIS AND USE AS THE TRANSITION.

This chapter has dealt with the evolution of design in initial phases and responses to learner experience to resolve tensions. A key focus of this chapter has been  barriers to computer coding and use of particular software. I have explored alignment with the results of extensive research from the constructionist school. While much the focus of much constructionist research  is on the design of toolsets to facilitate to personal knowledge building and expression via open project work, more recent work from researchers in this school has started to embrace the value of situated, community driven production as a lens [@kafai_theory_2020]. One of my central proposals regarding the methodology of this thesis is that while under-explored in this area, there is great potential in collaborative design based approaches to uncover situated and emergent practices in a way that can help seed community activity by other facilitators.

The following chapters have a focus on this gap. The next chapter explores a potentially fruitful aspect to help guidance for educational practitioners. The use of a design pattern approach. In this study the patterns take the form of working with common game elements game design patterns. In the language of the theoretical framework, I explore the process of working with GPDs as a germ cell of the overall game making activity. Chapter six explores the delivery and start to explore the impact of the process drama used and emerging community processes on cultural dimensions of the game making activity.

<!-- How much to write on this here? Or the discussion chapter? -->

<!-- Interactions in the interpersonal plane in this model are described as guided participation. Guided participation in not a prescriptive  pedogogy or set of activities, rather it refers to any activities and interactions between learning community members which contribute towards shared endeavours.

The term expounds a view of learning as happening between the poles of direct instruction and free exploration. A
The core activity of my participants was implementation of chosen game design patterns. -->

<!-- In PBL, UDL and other models - learner choice and building agency is shown to be of value in increasing engagement and ownership over learning.

Howver, in starting experiments I observed that the long time in building the relevant knowledge to identify, agree on and implement game patterns negatively impacted motivation.

In order to accelerate the process of making a game to fit into contextual expectations of an acceptable project timeframe, I pre-chose the genre of game to be made and based on my previous teaching experience, analysis of literature and knowledge of platform games, I pre-prepared a set of coded example and tutorials to implement a range of game design patterns. -->

MOVED TO DISCUSSION CHAPTER??
### Personal Dimension of the Learning - Personal Appropriation
In line with sociocultural approaches Rogoff points out the limits of an understanding of knowledge which promotes a view of knowledge as transmission from teacher to learner and is thus an individual process. Instead this exploration of knowledge and practices is framed as a mutual process.

While, this is potentially problematic in classroom environments, the mutuality of the process is evident in my responses to tensions via changes in design and spontaneous practices and understandings of knowledge required to make games enacted by participants.  

One significant tension I felt in evolving design was a nagging feeling that learning happening should be documented, or linked to some kind of curriculum. There are elements of the design which suit development of coding concepts and Computational Thinking.
However, I felt reluctance to explicitly teach these links via direct transmission. -->


<!-- #### Tensions related to fundsThe use of a physical map on which GDP were arranged aimed to communicate which patterns were more complicated to implement.  Starting patterns limited the maximum complexity of missions and present patterns to encourage learners to start with ones that involve simple code changes but return a large change in terms of gameplay experience.

<!-- **If it is not recorded, learners and facilitators may lose track of what has been covered in the process of making a game. Thus reducing opportunities for project reflection. However, stopping activity to record formally interrupts the enjoyment of game making.**

Tracing the learner pathway on an attractive physical map in the learning space can help integrate navigation and reflection into the creative process. -->

PERHAPS INCLUDE ABOVE IN PHASES IN PART
**Learners interact with code primarily using the mouse keyboard and screen which does not take advantage of benefits of physical computing for learner engagement.**
Connecting arcade buttons to the computer via simple electronics is a project which can be completed quickly. The process of students building their own arcade cabinets for a games showcase increased their perception of the authenticity of their end goal

<!-- MOVE LATER?
**Online resources vs Print outs**
Also a tension of moving online with resources, via having them available in the class.
Try to resolve with a summary as a laminated card, and then online as well - this tension is partly to do with the data gathering process, as it is easier to follow if it is visible on the screen. -->

Thus setting out a path for the following chapters. -->

<!-- Rogoff's [-@rogoff_observing_1995-1] describes three planes of personal, social and community activity which she advocates as foci for analysis. The model problematises the dichotomy of learner led, teacher led approaches [@mascolo_beyond_2009] in a way which suits the space between formal and informal learning that this community based model of game making occupies.

While the author's original research was on indigenous cultural practices on a village level, the model has been applied in both formal and informal educational settings; including FIND THREE EXAMPLES -

In this research I am interested in the way that facilitators can help nurture community practices and also in the way that participants have co-created the learning design created in this research and how participant practices have evolved. -->

<!--
In this section I outline Rogoff's initial conceptions of activities happening in three planes and related them to emergent activities in the game making community of this research. _I will also bring in critical counterpoints from relevant theory and compare to other "authentic"  teaching frameworks including PBL as a way to widening this analysis._

This document is being fleshed out with examples from video data.

<!-- Due to the complexity and many moving parts of the design it has been mostly descriptive. -->

<!-- While CHAT provides the technique of highlighting emerging tensions and resolutions, to undertake deeper analysis I will an analytical process proposed by Rogoff which examines learning communities using 3 foci. -->
