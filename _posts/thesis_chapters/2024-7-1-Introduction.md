# Introduction - “Games for a Read / Write World.”

### A study of the cultural and interpersonal dimensions and evolving tool use of an emerging community of families coding digital games together.

Author Mick Chesterman

## Abstract

To come - for now see outline of thesis at the end of chapter

### Research Questions - July 2024

1. What contradictions arose in participation in this research's game coding processes and what pedagogical tools and processes are available to address these contradictions?
2. How can game design patterns support the development of computational fluency in novices?
3. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?


## 1. Background to the thesis

We live in a society where digital technology is increasingly used in work and home-life in increasingly complex and prevalent ways. Sophisticated media production and delivery systems, often driven by algorithmically generated suggestions which may lead to a more passive consumption of media and reduced critical engagement with content. Convenience and automation of tasks in the form of commercial software services and AI can foster passivity can diminish critical thinking skills and make individuals overly reliant on technology. These concerns have led many to call for a  broader approach to digital education that includes media literacy, hands-on coding experiences and creative digital projects. This would therefore encourage a more active and critical engagement with technology in a way that would potentially benefit wider society.


### An introduction to research on digital game making

While much research on digital game making focuses on its educational benefits for subjects like mathematics and science, as well as enhancing coding skills [@kafai_constructionist_2015], there is also a diverse range of motivations behind game making, including critical making and empowerment. This study stands as a small contribution to a more inclusive approach to technology development, moving beyond a future dictated by a technological elite to one shaped by a broadly informed society.

In this thesis, I explore digital game making as a vehicle to develop to computational fluency and participation in coding community practices. While this thesis covers practical process of learning to code, it also addresses aspects of game making more to do with the overall expressive value of digital media. To serve this exploration the concept of computational fluency, is used as a guiding principle throughout the thesis. The term communicates 'not only an understanding of computational concepts and problem-solving strategies, but also the ability to create and express oneself with digital technologies' [@resnick_computational_2018]. For Resnick fluently, whether with writing or coding, helps develop your thinking, voice, and identity [@resnick_lifelong_2017]. Resnick's aim here is to critique formulaic and instruction based computing education [@resnick_coding_2020].

The refocusing of the UK curriculum and supporting exams in the area of digital education towards a more abstract approach to computer science concepts over a skills based production have caused concerns. Kemp and colleagues'[@kemp_future_2024] recent report on the future of computing education note the decreasing take up of computing by girls and those in lower socio-economic areas and an increasingly unequal offer of digital based exams to students. One of the recommendations of this report is to offer move informal digital making and project work involving coding as an inclusive practice.

Game playing practices and the opportunities provided by participation in wider communities  continue to evolve. For example, casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014].    

Thus the process of coding retro games lies at a confluence of diverse contexts, motivations and possibilities. My study, in part, asks how the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities can be brought into more structured educational environments. To answer this question theoretical and practical understandings of the development of agency in the participation in informal community-based projects are of value. The next section begins to explain my personal interest in this dimension of the study through a brief exploration of my involvement in project-based approaches in digital media education and campaigning contexts.

### Personal context and motivation for undertaking this study

<!-- In 1995, as  recent graduate and new editor of a fanzine on the fledling electronic music scene centred around the Hulme venues of the Nia centre and New Adri, I was directed to this centre as it had the software Abiword which had the ability to print out rounded text boxes, a feature I thought would look pretty snazzy cut and pasted over over-photocopied backgrounds from 2000AD. No physical place in the UK seemed to better live out the counter-cultural, dystopian, cyberpunk ethic popularised by 2000AD and the author William Gibson. -->


<!-- In the middle of regenerated Hulme on the corner opposite the Birley fields campus is a squat unassuming building called the church of the Ascension. It is notable Apart from being  a site of sanctuary for the political refugee Viraj Mendis in a notable anti-deportation campaign of the 1980s, it was also the site of one of Europe's first electronic village halls, Hulme Community
##  Computing Centre. Here a encouraged me to make a website a music fanzine I edited, giving me a print out on how to write HTML web pages and offering free space asOn 5 July 2024, a draft resit timetable will be shared with Heads of Department and Department Education Leads for review, with any comments to be returned by end of 10 July 2024.  part the projects website. This spirit of peer-learning combined with my desire to share the ethos of the DIY music scene fuelled many years of using the internet to promote unlicensed music events. In 1995, the internet, like Hulme, seemed to be a corporate free space, a space for oddballs, niche enthusiasts and more importantly activists. This period saw increasing alignment with the growth of the internet to link up activities of disparate political and cultural groups around gatherings international finance institution (IFIs). For me this culminated in helping to organise and promote an event for June 18th 1999. Similar carnival-themed events drew on the blue print of reclaim the streets mixing street blockaded by outdoor sound systems. While the site of street party and protests as a chaotic and inspirational environment has been explored [@carmo_reclaim_2012; @jordan_notes_2005]. -->

My journey into the world of technology and education began in the 1990s, when I was actively involved in organizing and promoting unlicensed music events and festivals. Email and websites became important tools in this process, and I was an enthusiast early adopter of these technologies. In in the mid-nineties, when I first started publishing websites, the internet appeared almost free of corporate messages. It was a space for oddballs, niche enthusiasts and activists. In the 2000s, my focus shifted towards environmental activism, migrant rights and left-libertarian protests against unaccountable global institutions like the WTO, IMF, and G8.  I used film screenings and music events for outreach and email lists, websites and wikis as organising tools. My work with Undercurrents, a video activism magasine, involved digitising their VHS content for online distribution [@heritage2008video]. Through Undercurrents, I connected with a broader network of media and internet activists associated with the Indymedia project  [@pickard_united_2006].

These experiences exposed me to non-hierarchical organising approaches and the decentralised organising principles, which are also an important guidelines for the free software and free culture movements [@lessig_free_2004] (INCLUDE OPEN WEB). Inspired by these potential of the tools and organising processes, I began to share relevant approaches with local organisations by specialising in internet and media creation training and community development.

<!-- I set up and ran three media centres from the period 2005 to 2009. The first at an Manchester city centre social centre and cafe, another for Community Arts Northwest and a third for People's Voice Media in Salford. I documented and promoted low-cost media and web production processes in as a member of with FLOSS Manuals and Transmission international networks. As part of this process I co-wrote A Open Web which celebrated the opportunities of the decentralised, even playing field provided by open source web technology and processes. -->



<!-- In 2001 later after working as a teacher, and being immersed in the party and protest scene I returned to Manchester and found a home in the Redbricks estate. Since 1999 local residents had rented a pre broadband T2 internet collection and used linux servers and snaking, self-made  network cables across roads, through roof spaces, to share this connection for affordable prices. Pete helped set up our connection for a home office for a new internet project called Beyond TV which was a pre-YouTube internet sharing site off shoot of the Undercurrent VHS magasine video activist project [^4].   -->

<!-- The reality that the police and wider authorities had just been letting direct actions happen and even instigating some of them was stark. -->

In 2011, it was revealed that an undercover police officer named Mark Kennedy, operating under the alias Mark Stone [^1], had infiltrated several activist groups I had been part of. My role in outreach for this movement became very uncomfortable, as it became clear to extent to which our participation in this movement came with hidden risks. Our attempts to create systemic change were being countered with response from the state who were far better resourced than our grassroots movement. The momentum of this movement had been in part by driven by new uses of technology and grass-roots organising processes. However, the open web’s potential for egalitarian and non-corporate publishing was undermined through the “embrace, extend, and extinguish” tactic[^3]. Concurrently, the open posting Indymedia network suffered from extensive posting of misinformation and ad-hominem attacks from suspicious sources targetting community activism on social media.   

In response to growing discomfort around involvement in political and environmental activism and the need to support myself financially, I shifted my focus increasingly towards community development. I concentrated on my work with FLOSS Manuals, writing and promoting documentation and online learning resources for media creation and collaborative processes using Free Software. This work allowed me to  document and advocate for low-cost media and web production methods and co-author _A Open Web_ [^5] a book which celebrated the opportunities provided by open source and decentralised web technology to create a more equalitarian environment of digital participation. The FLOSS Manuals project also connected me to diverse international networks whose work was informed by participatory production and decision making methods. A key network was the Mozilla community where I created documentation, workshops guides and other learning resources with networks of informal educators. This avenue offered a reconnection to the discussing the politics of independent communications in line with an empowerment agenda.



<!-- Jensen, Michael (September 24, 2018). "Russian Trolls and Fake News: Information or Identity Logics?". Journal of International Affairs. 71 (1.5): 115–124. -->

<!-- Project-based community and communications felt rewarding but the legs of community-based adult education were being cut off by the coalition government. -->
<!-- My response was to shift focus towards community work and training and documentation work with international networks and then eventually to informal learning of media creation with young people and families. While this move was a retreat from other domains in part driven by painful experiences outlined above, my shift of interest towards young people and family was a positive and strategic shift to align with my new role as a university tutor in education and as a new parent. -->

<!-- There are positive elements to this otherwise sad story. My experiences have helped focus my interests on how change can happen and happen quickly when new opportunities become available to a community eager to use them. They also caution against unrealistic expectations of systemic change when faced with opponents with deep pockets and extensive resources. I would like to communicate a pragmatic approach of finding the limits of your agency, strategically pushing against them, and cautiously observing what happens. An informed activism built on a critical view of the nature of the system in question. -->


Discussion around the launch of a new UK computing curriculum in 2014 championed the possibilities of creative digital production within the classroom [@livingstone2010next]. I undertook a masters in Computing and then an PGCE in teaching Computing. As part of my PGCE dissertation I designed and delivered a pilot scheme to teach javascript in playful ways. The learning materials were made available as an OER as part of Mozilla's online teaching resources [^2]. However the constraints of the school context hindered the kind of authentic activities that first attracted me to teaching in Computing in schools. Instead, after completing my PGCE, I joined Manchester Metropolitan University in a role focusing community education partnerships as part of the EdLab project [^4]. This work provided opportunities to pursue creative project based approaches to teaching technology to young people and families. Building on the success of this work, I applied to undertake this PhD study with Education and Social Research Institute of Manchester Metropolitan University (ESRI).


<!-- **Case Study as example: Digital Braves as a small MoE / 5D project**

Digital Braves was a short project which culminated in a session

A product of partnership work at university. Aligning the potential needs of home educated families with exploration of uncomfortable digital issues. It drew on the expertise of the drama department in Manchester Met school of eduction.

It is worth noting that some families who were not attracted to gaming explicitly took part in the research process. Perhaps because of the ethos of the Digital Braves program mitigated fears of working with technology. -->


<!-- My engagement with game creation via coding stemmed a consultation with home educators via EdLab partnership work. To align with the interests of parents and children at the consultation asked if we could lead activities which drew on interest in games like Minecraft to start to do computer coding. As I began to investigate games as a medium to explore and create as a playful educational experience, I saw possible parallels to previous work. -->
<!--
Building fluency of media production and personal expression aligns with motivation of empowerment and equality of access to digital participatory culture mirroring my experience with DIY music events and protest culture. -->





<!-- As well as the process of learning a useful technical skill, I was also interested the mutual process of designing an inclusive learning design that drew on participants interests. I wanted to use a project based approach which avoided instruction and allowed participants to follow diverse paths and be part of a slightly chaotic but productive learning community. -->

<!-- Because previous experience had made me wary of previous experience of embracing technology opportunities and suffering from unintended consequences I was keen to choose an approach which allowed for a careful examination of context and motivations.  

In this introductory chapter, I briefly outline the use of AT and agency and methodology approaches. I also outline contextual factors of some of the areas of activity where the learning approach studied may be relevant. -->

### Connecting my experience to broader research themes

In this section I outline how these experiences connect to broader research issues on PBL, media and game creation within informal learning environments. Drawing on learner's interests and creating authentic products is a foundational approach of PBL and is explored in game making context in convincing research. My past aims surrounding empowerment and freedom of expression through DIY music events and protest culture aligns with broader movements who advocate equality of access to digital participatory culture. However, my experiences highlight the barriers to undertaking practical project-based learning (PBL) projects, particularly in a UK computing context, a theme which is explored further in the literature review.

The process of being involved in short term systemic change only to suffer later backlash has guided me to help others explore a more critical exploration of their own place within wider systems. This may seem tangential to the activities of participants studies in this research, however such processes of building agency in a fledgling community can be seen as important acts of community participation. A special issue of Mind and Culture [@kajamaa_young_2019] focuses on young people, digital mediation, and transformative agency. This theme is explored by RQ.3 and becomes the guiding principle of Chapter 7.

Improvisational approaches present or messiness in my previous work may seem chaotic, the process builds a collective understanding of the problem area among participants. This communal experience of transformative agency also has the potential to  mitigate the effects unintended and unwelcome consequences through rapid, responsive adjustment in the course of a project. In addition, I find useful Rogoff's reflection that initial first impressions of a 'chaotic' environment of learning in a community of learners are false impressions that stem from a lack of understanding of the underlying structure of activity [-@rogoff_developing_nodate, p. 219]. These aspects are explored in later chapters in reflections on design based research.  

<!-- Rogoff reflection on the seemingly chaotic processes happening in a community of learners [].   -->

<!-- The process of launching into the unknown with project involving a group of people hoping to collectively make some kind of progress towards a sketchy goal was something familiar to me but under-explored.  Dave Gray's Gamestorming resource [gray_gamestorming_2010] (which became a guiding principle of EdLab project work) outlined a principle of fuzzy goals adapted from Blackwell's work [blackwell_radical_2009]

The process aligns with mutuality of design work and acknowledgement that while the process can seem a bit sketchy the results which incorporate ideas from diverse participants, also build a collective understanding of the problem area among participants which is as valuable as the proposed solution. It can also avoid unforeseen consequences by a more rapid adjustment in the course of a project. -->


## 2. Context

This introduction restricts exploration to two key themes, contextual settings and barriers to participation. Key themes continue to be explored in the literature reviews in Chapter 2.

### Context of School based computing education and game making

<!-- The most prominent learning objective of making games in educational setting is to develop _coding and computing skills_. There are extensive studies on _game making to learn other subjects_ including maths, biology and chemistry but diverse examples exist. Game making can also develop social skills, self-reflection, cultural awareness and a range of technical abilities that allow participation in information society. There are also a powerful vehicle for exploring issues involving race, sex, social issues [@tekinbas_quest_2010]. -->

<!-- While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research. -->

The changing shape of provision on UK digital-focused education in schools can be profitably examined through several key developments. The first is Google leader Eric Schmidt's speech as a MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2011,  critiquing current computing provision, "Your IT curriculum focuses on teaching how to use software, but gives no insight into how it’s made" [@schmidt_eric_2011, p.8]. The second was a report "Shut Down or Restart?" by the Royal Society (RSA) [the_royal_society_shut_2012] released in early 2012. The report recommended steering the ICT curriculum towards computer science and programming, providing funding professional development and a greater inclusivity in computing education, and increased partnership work with computing professionals. In the same week Michael Gove an announced the scrapping the ICT curriclum [gove_michael_2012]. Finally, the new, _computing_ curriculum was released in 2013 to a mixed response [@dfe2013national]. However, while community responses were collected via a consultation, a clear consensus to avoid removal of too much digital literacy and creative project work was ignored in the final curriculum [@twining_we_2013]. Preston [@preston_re-engineering_2013] echoes Twining's concern that Gove echoing of Schmidt's critique was misjudged
Gove, based on a breadth and depth of good practice in the sector.

A recent report by Kemp and colleagues [-@kemp_considerations_2024] on the future of computing education confirms some of the initial concerns  about the new curriculum and related exams among hose active in the sector . The report outlines the disparity and dropping numbers in the uptake of digital-related qualifications. A previous report, "After the Reboot" [@waite_pedagogy_2017], found that girls, ethnic minorities, and students of lower socio-economic status were all less likely to take computing as a subject at the GCSE level, in part due to cultural barriers and the relative difficulty of the subject. The review highlighted several areas of promise that needed more research that are relevant to this study including: game making as a way of increasing engagement in coding, use of design patterns to scaffold coding processes, and a greater focus on social and cultural aspects of coding.

Game making aligns well with the principles of inclusive practices and project-based learning (PBL) by providing learner choice, authentic and shareable project outcomes, and iterative project work supporting student mastery. However, despite the report's advocacy for game making and other digital projects to mitigate issues of exclusion, the structural limitations of the curriculum and computing exams remain. These limitations and responses to these and other contextual challenges of game making in schools are explored in Chapter 2.

### Context of game making and wider digital making and culture home and informal settings


The contextual challenges in UK computing education outline above contrast with the positive developments in digital making, specifically through new software and hardware. The decline in participation in digital qualifications after curriculum changes highlights a mismatch between the curriculum and the opportunities provided by recent advancements. The affordable, compact, and hackable Raspberry Pi computer has opened new avenues for physical computing using the accessible Python language. In early 2013, MIT released Scratch 2.0, a block-coding tool for beginners, featuring an online editor and enhanced community interaction, including project remixing. Educators have adapted creative 'sandbox' games like Minecraft to develop design skills in a playful environment. Other accessible hardware, such as Makey Makey and Microbit, combine web-based block coding with simple physical computing. For more advanced learners, free web-based courses on authentic, text-based programming languages like Python and JavaScript  added interactive elements to scaffold and motivate the acquisition of coding concepts and practical coding skills. A notable example is Code Academy.

These tools and practices were mostly free both in terms of cost and through the use of open copyright licences, a characteristic that contributed to their widespread success adoption. The engagement of many teachers and enthusiastic volunteers in these initiatives these is documented the proliferation of videos, blog posts, and other resources sharing novel practice. This ground swell of community activity contributed to the already active Maker Movement ,as illustrated by events like Liverpool MakeFest which and Raspberry Jam events. These grassroots events brought together teachers, professionals, young people and their families to engage with diverse new technologies in playful, empowering and technically challenging ways.

#### Home education settings as a site of research

While home education is not a core focus of this thesis, it is a significant contextual factor in the research process. As such, I address key contextual factors that impact this study here. Research in schools settings is sometimes hampered by practical issues such as timetable considerations and lack of time for project work outside of the subject curriculum. These factors are largely absent when working with home educating families. An alignment with the needs of participants was also a relevant factor in this work with home educators, allowing for reciprocity in the research process. My engagement with game creation via coding stemmed a consultation with home educators as part of my university outreach and partnership work. To align with the interests of parents and children at the consultation asked if we could lead activities which drew on interest their children's interest in digital games, Minecraft being a name example, to promote computer coding. Home educators' motivations are explored more broadly in Chapter 2,

<!-- Other contextual factors regarding home and informal learning environments and digital making are explored in Chapter 2. -->


### Overview of barriers to game making which apply to both formal and non-formal environments

While the previous sections have addressed some of the opportunities and benefits of engaging in digital game making, there are significant barriers that affect both formal and informal contexts to varying extents. This section gives an overview of key issues related to the scope of this study. Technical barriers include the inherent complexity of coding and can be compounded by economic barriers that can prevent access to the software, hardware or social environments needed to develop as a game maker. Identity-related barriers such as those related to gender, race and class have been shown to negatively impact participation in digital making and more specifically game making. This research addresses each of these concerns at different stages of this thesis.

## 3. Research objectives and questions

### Research objectives & Recap of motivation

DUP-A
Despite the many studies published on the benefits of game making for learning, particularly in the years 2013 to 2020, few contain detailed specifics of pedagogies or tool use when supporting learners in initial stages of game design. Additionally, many of the technologies used in past studies are not longer practical to use. A notable case being Game Star Mechanic which uses the now retired Flash web-browser plug-in. This study aims to evaluate and build on relevant research, detailed in Chapter 2, and to update practices to use open-source, industry standard, web-technologies (HTML and JavaScript) with an aim add longevity, authenticity extensibility to the game making toolset. In addition this research proposes a clear but flexible pedagogy based around this use of gameplay design patterns, that has emerged from a responsive design process. These themes are continued in the design narrative of Chapter 4.  

A personal motivation driving this research is to better understand my practice as an activist, community worker and practice-focused educator.  As a practitioner, while I had a sense of what success felt like in creative media project work, I lacked clear language to communicate this either in the academic or practice based settings. This motivation has guided me towards existing research reflect on experiences of developing agency within a non-formal communities.  In my past community training practice, I used terms like _empowerment_ and promoting learners _choice_. As I used these terms in an academic context there was push back from colleagues - seeing choice as a term tainted by market driven trends in education. Instead, to help reflect on this issue, this thesis engages with a complex and dynamic picture of participant agency. This complexity is important to this thesis as it allows a full exploration of contextual factors at play, especially initial and emerging barriers to participation to undertaking project work. One research question of thesis addresses the process of developing agency within a community. While agency and autonomy have disputed, often inter-related definitions [@huang_autonomy_2013; @matusov_mapping_2016]. In chapter 3, this study explores the following terms to guide later analysis: instrumental agency; relational agency ; and authorial agency.



<!-- Thus proposed motivations for supporting coding and game making should be analysed alongside the financial models which support activities.  -->
<!-- Thus proposed motivations for supporting coding and game making are analysed alongside the financial models which support activities. I am guided by the work of Vossoughi and colleagues  [@vossoughi_making_2016] whose see critique of maker movement shows the potentially negative impact of the positivist, industry-focused STEM agenda on inclusive practice. -->


### Research Questions - July 2024

1. What contradictions arose in participation in this research's game coding processes and what pedagogical tools and processes are available to address these contradictions?
2. How can game design patterns support the development of computational fluency in novices?
3. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?


### Wider implications and applications of the research

To further understand research objectives it is important to situate the potential relevance of the outcomes of this research by exploring its potential audience and impact. Given the overall direction of this thesis, there are several possible audiences to which this is relevant. These include home educating families, teachers and facilitators, researchers in computing, and media production areas. To address this potential a concrete and detailed approach to describing the research is taken to allow for the communication of specifics of workshop practices and pedagogical approaches. Practitioners may find the narrative description of the design in Chapter 4 an accessible starting point for this work.

Educational researchers may find the exploration of agency in this study of particular value. In Chapter 7 I employ recent advances in sociocultural interpretations of collective agency, using transformative agency in particular, to analyse this community game making context. As such, while not theoretically novel, this work may form a useful, situated contribution to emerging work in this area.  

To return to the pedagogical outputs, to find out who may benefit from the proposed inclusive game making pedagogy it is of use to ask _who benefits from the success of the Game Making Movement?_ The term Game Making Movement has not been widely applied, but its use by some writers indicates that a significant amount of research has been carried out as part of funded programs, not to mention extensive and creative efforts by professionals and volunteers alike to incorporate this game making into educational experiences.  There are diverse motivations to encourage in game making for learning. Examples are explore in more depth in  Chapter 2, but include: supporting a stem-pipeline into industry, aims to develop digital literacy, to learning other school subjects or exploring ethical issues. When commercially or institutionally sponsored, some of the sponsor's expectations may negatively impact the inclusivity of the learning environments in which game making happens. For examples, see Vossoughi and colleagues  [@vossoughi_making_2016] critique of maker movement and the potentially negative impact of the positivist, industry-focused STEM agenda on inclusive practice. This study aims to lean in the other direction and prioritise learner agency. However, the developing of computational fluency in learners is of broad utility to varied streams and motivations. As such, the pedagogy and toolset to facilitate game making should be used broadly.  


## 4. Introduction to theoretical framework

Choosing a theoretical framework which aligns with the goals of the research questions is an important decision in undertaking a PhD study. In my role as both a practitioner and a researcher, it was vital to select a framework that could incorporate potential complications within the research process. The focus of the research required a framework containing concepts able to the following: analyse the evolution of participant agency in the learning process, accommodate authentic learning contexts, conceptualise barriers to participation, and support a mutual approach to involving the community in design changes. To meet these needs I have chosen cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) and supplemented it with specific techniques of design-based research (DBR). The following sections give a short overview of these frameworks in relation to these needs. They are explored in depth in Chapter 3.

### Cultural historical activity theory

<!-- - explores tensions
- is optimistic but realistic about change
- rich concepts for agency
- aligns with dbr -->

In the interests of evaluation the pedagogical possibilities of new software, hardware and coding environments, researchers frequently adopt a position as a practitioner or co-facilitator of a novel learning design a researcher of the process. Thus a concept of learning or processes that is dynamic and open to change is needed.

The focus of barriers to participation and strategies to address them is covered by RQ1 using the phrase '_what contradictions arose in participation_'. The term contradiction is a significant in the school of research known as cultural historical activity theory (CHAT),  encompassing a variety of concepts including barriers, contextual drivers and drags, interventions for change, and tensions which emerge between different elements of the activity in question. CHAT is optimistic but realistic in its focus on change. It approaches activity in a systemic way and contains tools to address and discuss issues of unintended consequences and push back against interventions.  

This study, in part, explores ways in which how the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities can be brought into more structured educational environments.



<!-- However, I am wary to celebrate this uncritically given my recent experiences of unintended consequences of change. This applies even in a computing teaching context.  For while as a Computer teacher candidate I was drawn to the possibilities offered by a new technologies and the shifts in computer pedagogy, school settings faced constraints of the curriculum, exams and time related pressures which threaten to prevent the kind of authentic project based work. I want to be able to give detailed tools of critically analysis that do not paralyse but also do not unthinkingly evangelise social change in ways which may be unsafe or unrealistic. -->



#### Why activity theory and not constructionism

Constructionism has been used as a "epistemological paradigm, a learning theory and a design framework" in varied contexts [kynigos_constructionism:_2015], in particular, game making related studies [].

There was a messiness and explorative freedom to the emerging research process and a dedication to projects that worked with the interests of participants.

The messiness of approach resonated with Papert and Turkle's celebration of bricolage approaches and corresponding rejection of the primacy of abstract approaches to learning computing. This ethos had been developed into a school of pedagogy named Constructionism which continues to be popular in computing education in particular through the work or MIT labs.  

These are elements of constructionist pedagogy that are explored in Chapter 2.

This chapter has already addressed the overall ethos of conducting educational research in situ, i.e. in an authentic educational context. The context of this research being  a new learning community in a University setting involving of home educating parents, myself as a researcher / facilitator, and volunteer student helpers.

In recent years researchers from constructionist school have started to describe the importance a situated approach to studying and critical approach to game making studies [@kafai_revaluation_2022; @kafai_theory_2020].


However, constructionism lacks some of the tools provided by CHAT, and its research outputs still retain a primary focus on its historical concerns on a more personal understandings of knowledge. For a sociocultural critique of constructionism see Vossoughi et al [-@vossoughi_making_2016].

In addition CHAT augments this situated perspective on learning with tools to study the impact of past cultural activity of participants on present activity.

Instead AT offers a rich language to explore the kind of empowerment and limits to it in a wider contextual sense.

It also provided a diversity of concept to explore a complex and dynamic picture of participant agency.

###  On Agency

**Agency:**
As these new technologies can provide communities with tools to leverage new opportunities in a way which gives participants greater agency, a research framework which contains a toolset of concepts to describe and analyse varied dimensions of agency is beneficial.

The link with this thesis here is that the process of community change can be rapid and transformational and that greater understanding of the processes involved are of value. Thus, a wider goal is the research is to reflect on experiences of developing agency. While agency and autonomy have disputed, often inter-related definitions [@huang_autonomy_2013; @matusov_mapping_2016]. This study uses the following terms which can help locate RQ3 more precisely: instrumental agency, relational agency and authorial agency.

My personal context illustrates the 'risky' process of collective agency working on objectives that may run away to involve unforeseen outcomes [@edwards2009systemic, p. 200]. On a personal level, I take a more balanced approach to be wary unintended effects of embracing possibilities for social change offered new technologies.

A research process which involves participants and can be responsive and incorporate new ways of understanding learning. In addition, working with participants can allow contributions of novel ideas. Therefore - LINK TO DBR


### On Design-based research (DBR)

Design based research is not a uniform practice with set methodology but there is a general consensus in guiding principles. For Sandoval [-@sandoval_conjecture_2014] these involve joint work on a project and theoretical refinement, iterative design process involving phases of planning delivery, evaluation working towards outcomes of interest. While DBR is explored in a more nuanced way in Chapter 3, it is worth noting at this stage that it provides practical tools, which are complementary with CHAT, to undertake and to represent complex learning designs taking place in authentic learning environments. In particular, DBR provides means to fulfil a key motivation of this research, to represent the evolution of a useful game making pedagogy. As remarked earlier, the format of academic research papers, even those focused on pratice, often neglects methodological detail in favour of analysis and results. Hoadley notes "the usual study presents a technology fully formed as if it had risen from the oceans like Venus herself" [@hoadley_creating_2002]. To address this issue Chapter 4 of this thesis incorporates a design narrative, a process adopted from DBR, which I explain and justify in Chapters 3.


## 5. The significance of the thesis and its limitations


### The challenge of maintaining focus in this PhD process

Creating a design experiment with several iterations created not only large amounts of research materials. This presented not only challenges of how to prioritise data gathered (Chapter 4), but in addition the rich set of experiences and educational tools created made it difficult to disentangle the interplay of contributing elements to choose a focus suitable for a targeted PhD dissertation.

Beyond this chapter however I do prioritise key elements of the experience and disregard large amounts of the data gathered. I focus on two main sessions out of twelve recorded, putting to one side completely comparative data using a different coding tool. I have also put to one side a line of inquiry exploring a drama process introduced in the third phase of the design. Instead, the main prioritisation is represented in the research questions: that being, the use of gameplay design patterns, and their relationship with emerging participant agency. Even this more limited focus, still contains a rich interplay of diverse tool use, varied of and a study of different dimensions of agency shown by participants. While, at times, this diversity may ask a lot of the reader to follow, it is justifiable due to the complex nature of the learning experiences involved.  


### Gaps in existing research / Contribution to knowledge of this thesis

#### New research for new tools and approaches

While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research.  

This study is novel in its approach of using a JavaScript game library in a code playground coding environment as a tool for novices .

The process of sharing details of pedagogical practice for and audience of researchers and practitioners is complicated. As previously described, many game making studies mentioned also omit descriptions of pedagogies used. Illingworth's review [@illingworth_review_2017] of Kafai and Burke’s influential book on game making for learning [-@kafai_connected_2016], notes the lacks of specific details of the pedagogical approaches involved.

Even when processes are described, results are often too abstract to be useful or easily understood by practitioners or too bound up with contextual factors to be replicable [@hoadley_creating_2002 CHECK]. This is a grand problem in education which this work cannot resolve, but can only seek to mitigate against. To this end, this study is guided by research processes which share, design heuristics in a format that is accessible by researchers and practitioners. An example of which is the work of Brennan and Silverman [@resnick_reflections_2005], and Brennan and  Petrich in tinkering studios. As a result, my research proposes as a design heuristic, the use of a collection of game design patterns. While some existing research on this approach exists [@holopainen2007teaching], this work contributes significantly to this area in the following ways: specifically by researching the use of a GDP collection by novice coders to make games using code, and through the an analysis of emerging  pedagogical uses of gameplay design patterns which are explored in detail in chapter 5.

The research process has created numerous practical outputs for practitioners in the form of free-software and educational materials created under an open-licence.

#### Focus on community building

While the theme of collaborative pedagogies and social practices are well explore in literature on game making, the process of creating a game making community are under-represented. Few addressing an explicit intention to nurture a community of game makers or details how the process of community formation occurred. While this wider community formation is not the main focus of this study, it is a thread which is explored here through the lens of collective agency.

#### Cultural methodology using CHAT & 360 - really?

In order to capture and analyse this development I have used methods of data collection and analyse which I feel may be useful to share as a contribution to the field.

Chapter 4 details the methodology of recording a dynamic picture of social and cultural interactions. Of particular novel interest may be the use of concurrent, side-by-side analysis of capture of what was happening on participants computer screens and 360 video recordings of the room interactions.



<!-- This shows a legacy of Papert's work on maths concepts explored in computing microworlds.    -->

Instead, this thesis is inspired to a larger extent by the work of CHAT researcher to examine community participation within an evolving culture that involves digital creation and coding. For an example of this genre of research we can examine the work of  Cole and colleagues on the 5D project...


This study addresses this in part with a detailed exploration on the learning design in Chapter 5 a design narrative and  Chapter 7 which explores cultural elements of game making research.


### Limitations of this thesis

#### Application of resulting pedagogy to other domains

Th

I am cautions of making claims about transfer of knowledge of skills to other areas. Theories of situated learning view transmission of educational practice as a thorny problem as the process of learning is dependant on many contextual factors.

To illustrate this The promise of computational thinking was in part based on such claims of transfer.


But Guzdial shifted their views on this subject.

Thus why would this study based on observations of one context be of use?
Thoughts:  
- similar contexts exist
- underlying treads may emerge which may transcend context  


## 6. Chapter outline of the study

This introduction has been structured around key contextual factors that have spurred this inquiry and which have emerged from observational research and integrating existing theoretical understandings in this area. It has also outlined a motivation to better understand my own experience as a facilitator of learners creating media and digital products in relation to existing research.

While the immediate goal of understanding learning happening in temporary informal environments of learning coding, the findings have implications that of interest to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners who are looking to nurture creative and/or technical design practices in novice learners.  

In line with a situated view of learning the details of process of coding are important. Thus one of the challenges of this work is to explore the details to a non-expert audience. While the literature review will begin to disambiguate some of the terms used in the thesis there is in addition a glossary which outlines short definitions of technical terms used. The glossary is included as an appendix to this study and a summary table is present as an introductory section to the literature review.

The literature review begins the exploration of the key themes and threads that are integral to the findings of this study. These include: authenticity in project based approaches; nature of informal settings in particular home education; barriers to participation in digital making; pedagogies to create inclusive learning environments and to help young people learn computer coding. To follow I outline the theoretical framework and the key methodologies of this study. I explain how the design based research (DBR) aligns well with the aims of the research questions and the use of concepts from the socio cultural school and the leading approach of third generation activity theory (3GAT).

<!-- In doing so I explore the direction of travel of 3GAT and increasing synergies with DBR as methodologies whichIn summary, this introduction has established the core motivations for this study and outlined the key contextual factors that have shaped my inquiry into the facilitation of media and digital product creation. By exploring the nuances of informal coding environments and reflecting on my own experiences as a facilitator, the study seeks to address broader questions about nurturing creative and technical skills in novice learners. The introduction also highlighted the importance of making complex coding processes accessible to a non-expert audience and introduced the structure of the thesis, including a focus on key themes such as authenticity, barriers to participation, and inclusive pedagogical strategies. As we transition to the literature review, the next section will provide a detailed examination of relevant research and theoretical concepts that inform this study. This review will serve to clarify the foundational ideas and frameworks essential for understanding the study’s objectives and research questions, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of how design-based research and third-generation activity theory offer innovative approaches to the challenges identified in the introduction. suit both intervention by researchers into the learning environment being studies and corresponding input by research participants in the resulting design. -->

Chapter 3 details the theoretical framework used. It starts with a summary of key concepts aligned with the theoretical framework to aid the analysis of data gathered. This include: the iterative and mutually created and emergent nature of the resources and processes that were created and adopted; identifying a unit of analysis; and transformative conceptions of agency.

Chapter 4 describes the methodology of the study.  I outline the process of how data was gathered, processed and collected using screen capture and 360 cameras. I explore the challenge of gathering large amounts of research data and resulting prioritisation that resulted.   



Chapter 5 outlines the learning design that emerged from the research process. To explore emerging tensions in design in a way which communicates relevant context, I outline four conflicts in interrelated activity systems using the terminology of third generation activity theory (3GAT). This chapter discussion begins with an exploration of the tools used through the lens of authenticity. It continues by covering the mutual nature of the evolution of the design, and ends with a synthesis to initial barriers to engaging in game making practices and initial interventions to address them.

Chapter 6 focuses on the implementation of individual game design patterns (GDPs) and in doing so addresses how data gathered informs thinking on the research question - _how can game design patterns support the development of coding practices by novices_?
This chapter begins by re-examining of game design patterns and game play design patterns in the context of a community of novice coders. Following this a vignette of parent child interaction in game making process introduces an overview of interactions of that pair to help contextualise findings. The chapter then undertakes a systematic analysis of the use of game design patterns by participants drawing on detailed observations of practice. A discussion section explores implications and observations from these findings in relation to existing research and concepts.

Chapter 7 discusses the use of inclusive pedagogical methods that helped participants become part of an emerging community of game makers. It explores the role of the design of games and the surrounding communities that build up around games to support an nurture the development of player identities. The process is shown to have beneficial effects in supporting the creative process. I explore the use of a process drama to draw on their existing knowledge and encourages them to put this into practice via a playful fictional scenario.

Chapter 8 concludes the thesis with a final discussion on the significance of my findings in line with other research and discusses the limitations of this research and identifies areas for future work.

### 7. Link to next chapter
