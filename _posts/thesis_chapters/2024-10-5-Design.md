## Chapter Introduction  


<!-- MOVE TO INTRODUCTION  
This chapter uses the argumentative grammar of DBR and CHAT  approaches to aid discussion of the evolution of the learning design and situate the findings and analysis of following chapters. -->

<!-- In particular, the evolution of the key pedagogical features is analysed via  emerging tensions between system elements in learning design. Exploration of the shifts in the design of the intervention is done via a development of a design narrative which explores the driving forces behind changes in the design of each phase. -->


This chapter uses the CHAT concepts to analyse and describe transformations between phases of research intervention of family game making outlined in Chapter 4. To do this I adapt the technique of design narrative [@hoadley_creating_2002-1], a concept of design narrative emerged within DBR as a way to communicate the important detail of context to situate the findings of the next chapters and to allow the design to be by other practitioners and researchers in this area. [@hoadley_creating_2002-1; @brase_knowledge_2024; @bell_theoretical_2004]. In line with discussion of Chapter 3, this process is augmented by adding argumentative grammar of formative interventions within the Helsinki school's interpretation of third generation activity theory (3GAT).

In the first section this is achieved via identifying and analysing activity systems at different scopes, specifically their  system elements and the a detailed interpretation of the objects  of activity at each scope. To help ground the reader in a concrete detail, this process is undertaken using the context of a vignette included as Appendix 5.toby.

Three sections follow containing in-depth analysis of key areas of contradictions in the emergent activity and the resultant interventions to address those contradictions. The three areas of contradictions explored are: those in use of software tool use in P1 and P2; those associated with project navigation and the use of supporting documentation in P2; and contradictions surrounding participant identity within the game making activity. Each section advances the design narrative by drawing on technical and social observations from my research journal, additional session notes, and analysis of the created artefacts of games and documentation.

The discussion section of this chapter begins a synthesis of concrete issues arising in the evolution of the learning design using the 3GAT and DBR concepts: specifically, an iterative and mutual design process; double stimulation and its relation to participant agency; and the process of rising to the concrete through exploration of a germ cell concept in the from of the use of gameplay design patterns.

This section begins analysis of the learning intervention by elements of two scopes of activity system via an illustrative vignette included as Appendix 5.toby. The wider of the two activity systems explored in this section is represented in figures below, firstly as an activity stemming from the intersection of wider activity systems in Fig 5.x, and secondly as an activity in its own right in Fig 5.x

<!-- focusing on research goals on the part of the researcher, learning computing skills and concepts as a home education project and finally a broad aim of fun on the part of the children participants. -->


![Illustration 5.x - Broad Environmental Activity Systems  ](./Pictures/At_dia_3_v2.png){width=95%}
Figure 5.x - Broad Environmental Activity Systems

The figure above is necessary simplification of the sources of diverse cultural and contextual factors that feed into the new shared activity system. Examples of the influence of those wider systems in the game making activity including playful interactions, the supportive practices of parents, and guidance in practical coding practices from facilitators are explored in Chapters 6 and 7.  

WHERE TO BEST DESCRIBE THIS - see Ch.3 also ?

Turning to the activity system represented below in fig 5.x, the scope of activity here takes as a subject the community of individuals in the room during the game making sessions, namely parents, children, student helpers and myself as a researcher / facilitator.

<!--
Other relevant objectives of re include: a desire to create a useful learning experience on the part of student helpers; participating with other home educators in a creative environment and thus building team and communication skills;. -->

<!-- Within activity system at the scope, while there is a nominal shared object to the main activity to make games together, the community contains diverse actors with multiple objectives. -->

![Illustration 4.x - Larger game making activity system  ](./Pictures/At_dia_1_v5.png){width=95%}

Fig 4.1 : Activity system 1 - an emerging community of novice game makers community making games as a learning experience

To situate a description of this system explored, I draw on illustrative extracts from vignette 5.toby. Before the vignette description begins, the participant, a child Toby, had been working on his emerging platform game for the first 5 minutes of the session. He is working independently but sat next to his two grandparents D and S who are modifying their own game.
At the start of the vignette, in my role as session facilitator, I make a short opening announcement drawing the participants attention to the showcasing of their games to students in the building's foyer to help focus their attention on completion of their games. This imagined audience of players appears to contribute to Toby's  careful attention to the challenge and variety of the game playing experience in the specifics of his level design documented in the screen shots and description of the vignette. The more immediate audience of his peers is clearly important to him in guiding his design decisions. During the session, he invites other group members to play his game and initiates and responds to conversations around the difficulty his game design.  

<!-- This immediate and tangible audience for the evolving games as well as the programmes target  showcase event where the created games were shared in arcade cabinets to an audience of university students and staff.  -->

![Carrot eater game with an self made arcade unit made from cardboard boxes](./Pictures/carroteater3.jpg){width=90%}
Figure.carrot - Final showcase activity in Brooks Building with home made cabinet surrounding a laptop computer.

While my session announcement broadly frames the object of activity  as participation in community activity to make a game for an external audience, a 3GAT interpretation reveals several inter-related facets of the object. The object encompasses both digital and physical aspects, specifically varied software tools to develop a code and varied game assets, the use of physical computers for coding and then used within self-made arcade cabinets at the showcase stage. The object at this community scope of activity also includes the complex interaction of motivations driving participant of all community members. The motivation of playful and social interactions between participants became quickly tangible in a way that is explored below. Additionally, in P1, the object of the activity for the community needed to expand to include a focus on the evolution of a group working process of pedagogy to address tensions in the fledgling design.


<!-- The concept of idioculture is used in this study to deepen the description of the community dimension of 3GAT. -->
<!-- GDPs ( conceptualised here as game design patterns), which while often implemented on an individual or pair scope, were also fed back into community activity.  -->
<!-- IS THIS RELEVANT HERE? -->
<!-- These feed into the contradictions which emerge at this level of activity. -->
<!-- IS THIS NEEDED? While the programme had a shared objective of making a game, there were tensions brought by the cultural factors and other objectives imported from other activity systems. The third contradiction explored in this chapter explores those tensions (including? ....). -->

<!--
NOTE - More on large scope in AT terms? What is needed here? -->

By this stage (P2), the implementation of game design patterns had become an important organising principle for myself and participants. Toby's activity in this vignette could be broken to two main actions: one being to alter the existing level design of the game by changing the placement of game elements, the second to add a new game design pattern to his game by adding a new code structure to the starting project.

Following Barab and colleagues, who justify analysis of smaller activity systems in their study of a technology rich learning environment [@barab_using_2002], I analyse the implementation of these game design patterns as activity systems in their own right, rather than as sub-actions within the wider activity. At this second smaller-scale activity system the subject is an individual or parent/child paring and the driving motivation is to change specific features to individual games as represented in  Fig 5.x below. One benefit of analysis at this scope is that it allows detailed examination of contradictions in mediating processes involving tools use by individual or pair work, and the resulting  expansions in the object, further increasing the complexity of the object at the wider community activity scope, in a way which transcends a merely technical approach to include diverse elements of the emerging idioculture. The later section of the vignette shows evidence of this evolution including variations in the games created and social patterns of interaction.

Fig 5.2 Activity system 2 - Constructing a game feature by feature

<!-- ( NOTE - or at least as as a key unit of analysis).  -->

The object of activity at this level is less complex, namely the motivation is to implement or alter a design pattern to the participant/s game. In the course of the vignette, Toby uses a variety of tools in to achieve this activity: a web based coding tool (code playground), a game template which he has used as the base of his game project and, a menu of documentation linking to code examples and tutorials. Implementing more complicated gameplay design patterns involved several stages and varied tools. Those stages to be viewed as sub-actions to the motivation of applying a GDP. Using the terminology of Leontiev [-@leontiev_activity_2009], Toby can be seen undertaking certain chains of processes in a fluid way that shows that actions had become operations. The commentary of Vignette 5.t provides a more detailed description of this process.
The significance of activity at this scope, is reflected in my proposal of the implementation of GDPs as a germ cell concept, as explored within the theoretical framework of this thesis.  


## Narrative exploration of contradictions

The following sections of this chapter explore three main areas of contradictions within the framework of 3GAT. Addressing the novel and technical nature of the learning design, the first area of contradiction explores the shifts in software tool use between P1 and P2. The second section deals with issues arising associated with project navigation and the use of supporting documentation in P2. The third explores contradictions concerning participant identity, a topic represented as posing significant barriers to learning to code in research explored in the first two chapters.

### C1 - contradictions involving the use of game programming and asset authoring tools

In this section, I draw on journal notes to describe emerging tensions in the activity of kickstarting participant game design activity and the subsequent evolution in tool use between P1 and P2. A key motivation driving my initial interaction with participants in P1 was to facilitate an inclusive environment to introduce and explore the process of making games. To do this, I used several activities not involving computer coding to scaffold a game design process. Early sessions involved, playing and discussing retro arcade games, simple analysis of their components, brainstorming game story scenarios, pixel-art character making on paper, and making craft collages for game backgrounds. I also lent learners a laptop loaded with vintage arcade and console games to help build familiarity with arcade and retro game tropes via home play. Scenes and characters began to emerge in relatively unstructured planning sessions, with three groups of roughly five participants emerging. We then discussed what game features they would like to add to their games in the simple terms. Coding tools and processes were introduced in week 5, a delay was driven by my hesitation around the alienating effect of interacting with the unfamiliar experience of computer code. My own motivations to build on my previous research on novice use of open source, authentic web text languages, in the from of JavaScript [@chesterman_webmaking_2015], rather than a simplified novice block code increase this possibility. See Appendix 5.tech for a fuller technical break down of the tools used in each phase.

<!-- My previous research had explored the use of interactive, personal media creating using webpage languages of HTML, css and JavaScript [@chesterman_webmaking_2015]. I was keen to explore the potential of game authoring within a similar environment. As such, I drew on the documentation of the Mozilla community and selected Phaser as a JavaScript game making framework and Mozilla Thimble as a code playground (concepts explored in the literature review). A fuller technical break down of the tools used in each phase is omitted as it interrupts the flow of this narrative but it included as  
MOVE SOME OF THIS TO INTRODUCTION
-->

The use of a text coding into the game making process did indeed begin to contribute to a set of accumulating tensions which I describe in broad terms initially before focusing on those related to tool use. The gulf between the participants desired game changes and their inability to enact them in code, drove groups to specialise, with some with greater confidence or experience tackling coding while others worked on graphical game assets (both digital and physical), others planning narratives and gameplay features, some working on sound elements. At times, some  participant expectations exceeded a realistic scope for the game making project, a tension explored in more detail in Appendix 5.bee. While participants clearly needed to develop their coding abilities, the informal, home education setting led me to avoid whole class instruction. This feeling was validated by my reflections on two attempts to convene the groups attention on a screen presentation of key coding concepts which I evaluated in my journal as unwelcome interruptions to the participants making activities. Instead I addressed problems arising individually and as more problems emerged I started to become overwhelmed in dealing by the group dynamics and technical demands on my time. After one session, I emailed participants (see Appendix.narrative2) sharing that I was daunted by the task of facilitating the integration the disparate creative elements being produced separately into a project. I asked parents for ideas and support in organising and bringing more order to group and planning processes. These developing tensions can be represented as contradictions between the tools available to the participants and the object of actualising their ideas and graphical assets in code form. Additionally, my limited time as a facilitator indicates a dysfunctional relationship between division of labour and the object.

<!-- This observation aligning with other research which advocates just in time approaches to STEM instruction. FIND / DEVELOP  -->
<!-- **input of parents as organisers**

As the sessions continued, with many creatively processes happening simultaneously, and without a clear plan on how to integrate these disparate elements to pull the projects together, .  Reviewing my notes and email interactions from this time, I note a key exchange between my self and participants  -->

<!-- "It was a bit of a hard session for me on Wednesday as I was a bit low on confidence about how to pull all of your creativity into a finished game! It started to feel like a bit of a fantasy!" -->

<!-- A crisis point developed (despite the input of parents) to help an organisational process. While participants were being supported to develop assets in the form or game characters and ideas for features were being documented via lists, participants  did not have a working either a working knowledge of the tools used, or a process to start to build that knowledge. My own process of self research and informed tinkering drew on years of experience and was therefore not suitable as participants did not share those coding repertoires or familiarity with coding tools. While the suggested tools were theoretically available to the participants online, they were therefore stuck nevertheless.  -->


![tensions with tools](./Pictures/At_tension_1_v1.png){width=95%}
Figure 5.C1: Representation of emerging areas of contradictions in mid-P1 game making process


<!-- To address the last point, I worked with groups to help them adapt a game template from phaser tutorial and input their own graphics to at least create a static prototype / sketch of the game. -->

In response to my email, parents made suggestions including: use of a visible and shared list of game features that are being worked on, documentation to support the implementation their requirements, and more hands on use of tools before beginning the planning process. The group planning process improved, and the self-organisational abilities of parents and tenacity of young people involved developed. Groups expanded their activity by creating wish lists of game features, which acted as mediating tools use to coordinate between different team members and to requested facilitator support to implement them via code structures. In addition to helping directly via coding with participants, I began to create short stand-alone instruction documents if I thought the requested code  would be useful to other groups. Despite these changes which helped to address the area of contradiction outlined above, by this point so many tools and processes and had been introduced, complicating the object of activity at the group process level to such and extent that participants were disorientated and even overwhelmed (see Appendix 5.P1.feedback & Appendix 5.bee.).

On completion of P1, I reflected on the design challenge involved to address the areas of contradiction. The overall learning design should maintain positive affect towards to the object being worked on but engage in hands-on coding using authentic tools early in the process to avoid unrealistic expectations. A starting code experience should help novices build code familiarity without needing explicit instruction. Supporting documentation was needed but should not interfere with the flow of participants making experience. Finally, the overall learning design should encourage appropriate social learning, peer support and reflective practices but without overly complicating the object of activity or interrupting participant making. Three sections of this chapter describe different facets of these contradictions and interventions to address them. This, the first, tackles key transformations in use of primary tools, those used to directly achieve the task. The second addresses the area of help resources and documentation. Finally, other support process to support emerging social coding processes are examined.

<!-- As an example, when offering feedback to address her family's feeling of isolation from the coding process, the parent of the family had requested more hands on play and use of the tools of production before being called on to make creative decisions. -->
<!-- A starting toolset was needed to start this process.  It should rather than  inventing a simplified code language or inauthentic novice oriented tool,  -->

<!-- This challenge was brought sharply into focus by a particular conflict experienced by one family in particular. -->
<!-- As explored in the literature review, an extensive body of research on the design motivations and impact on learners exists for the creative coding tools Scratch.  -->


<!-- NOTE INTEGREATE HOW DESIGNING FOR AUTHENITITY IS A CHALLENGE HERE WHICH IS ALIGNED WITH PBL AND EXPERIENTIAL THEORY, FORESHADOW SHARED DIMENTIONS OF AUTHENTICITY WHICH ARE EXPLORED LATER. -->

<!-- I took care to screen participants from processes and tools that were unrealistic for novices to use. -->

<!-- In the activities of study, a high degree of authenticity made possible, in a material sense, by the digital nature of the learning resources. Beyond a general purpose computer, no prohibitive equipment is needed. -->


#### Using a starter game template within a code playground

<!-- Addressing the evolution in design and use of code and asset authoring tools, While the code playground and the code template within in it are two separate tools, from the perspective of the learner, they were experienced jointly. As such, I cover them together in this section. -->

The use of a code playground and starting template, while technically two separate tools, were experienced by participants as one experience. Code playgrounds, as described in Chapter 2, are online environments used to test, share or invite help from online users on complete or partial code projects or problems, primarily for web-based project involving the technologies of HTML, CSS and variations of JavaScript (for more detail see Appendix 5.tech). The use of code playgrounds by novices can mitigate against some of the initial challenges provided by learning computer coding stemming from  unfamiliarity with and potential complexity of code authoring tools and environments [@guzdial_programming_2004]. Tactics to mitigated against challenging elements include steps to reducing syntax errors, shielding complexity, facilitating community commenting, sharing, remixing and other forms of collaboration.

<!-- MOVE - In D1 I proactively reached out to Mozilla to ask about the future of Thimble, the code playground used in P1 and was informed that it would soon be discontinued due to end of funding. Their suggested replacement Glitch.com had a wider user base (beyond educators) and similar functionality.     -->

<!-- **Starting template** -->

In P1 I had guided participants to begin their games by using a very partial template based on an online tutorial [^]. As the process continued, it became apparent that the starting template greatly shaped the following design possibilities. Thus, in D1 I redesigned the starting code template of a game with a greater attention to pedagogical concerns. A summary of a how these concern were implemented in the design process follows (see Appendix 5.tech. for a fuller description). I made changes to make the code to reduce obscure syntax where possible to increase code readability and simplified the structure of inter-related functions to facilitate the process of adding new code structures and code snippets (see below).  The choice to pre-select a particular genre, specifically a _platformer_ game (see glossary), was a pragmatic response to reducing the tension caused by diverse help requests, by narrowing the range of game features that would be requested.

Additionally, to encourage playful, hands-on experimentation in early stages, I chose to use a working game template rather purely structural approach. I implemented a previous tactic [@chesterman_webmaking_2015]  of highlighting motivating and easily alterable code changes which had a large impact on the end project. Learners were introduced to starting template game by being asked to play it, but were unable to jump up onto the first platform. To progress, participants needed to change alter at least one of the key variables were highlighted at the very start of the game code (see Figure 5.code below). The underlying game structure limited initial user choice guiding a shared experience for all participants in a way which facilitated and encouraged peer learning. Kynigos and colleagues [-@kynigos_children_2018] explore this concept as a half-baked games where incompleteness or bugs in behaviour are a provocation to participants to correct or to further modify them. This process also aligns with the motivations and techniques of the UMC framework explored in the literature review [@lee_computational_2011], in particular the guideline to "create choices that show visible and immediate changes" [@lytle_use_2019-1, p. 6]. This rapid transition from the _use_ to _modify_ stages forced at an early stage, allowed a careful scaffolding of early coding experiences designed to help overcome negative affect towards text code. The alignment with UMC and half-baked design approaches, drove me to select other key affordances in the form of simple code changes which I explore after a summary of the structural design of the game template.

3. Css style sheet (not usually altered by participants)

Figure 5.code outlines a typical early view of the starting code project. The project consists of several interlinked files code and asset files (see glossary & appendix 5.tech). The typical view of Glitch.com project that learners interacted with had three main menus. First on the left options to change project settings, an assets link to  manage image and audio files and list of project files listing JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Second a central code window with code, comments. Thirdly, a game preview on the right where changes to the code were immediately updated in the resulting game project.


<!-- MOVE
While access to HTML and CSS files of the base project was available in the left menu as show in  by default participants would see only the JavaScript file names game.js . -->

<!-- IS IT? OR MOVE
It is of value to restate the positive impact of key design features here which align with extensive constructionist research creating simplified coding environments for novices. Immediate feedback, structured support in managing asset files, the online nature of projects allowing immediate peer testing. -->

<!-- #### Creating key affordances -->

<!-- - level design and prototyping: use of
- fluid variable editing effective movement
- The swapping of assets and more complex work with code syntax
- development of simple stories to bump personal expression and narrative -->



<!-- Returning to the creation of key starting affordances to support the half-baked / UMC approach, the placement of three key variables (changing gravity, altering the player jump height and walking speed) that impacted player movement at the very top of the game.js file accelerated and support the experimentation of users. The process here began with me imagining what would be a good feature that players would notice and be spurred to change. For example an annoying slow horizontal movement speed.  -->

Beyond the changing of movement variables, two key motivational affordance of the design were the ability to change the platformer level design and replacement of the deliberately simplistic colour block graphics with characters created by participants in the form of pixel art.

Addressing level design first, In P1 the process was relatively complex involving changing parameters of functions to change asset location, and spiralling code complexity (see Appendix 5.chapter and [^7]. Instead, to aligns with research on the value of a visual approach to coding multi-media projects for novices [@guzdial_programming_2004; @resnick_scratch:_2009],  in the P2 starting template the use of a graphical grid structure to edit level design shown in Fig 5.grid. A minimal choice of level design elements were represented specifically; platforms to be jumped on; hazards to be avoided; and rewards to be collected.

![](./Pictures/grid_editor_1.png){width=95%}
Figure 5.grid - Grid based editing of level design with a simple key for hazards, coins, and platforms.

Technically, each level is a JavaScript object consisting of a data array of 12 entries containing 17 characters which representing a matrix layout of the game. Each grid entry can be either black or one of the following: x (platform); h (hazard); o (coin). The structure of text-based array has a strong visual correlation with the resulting game layout and changes to the text based grid in the code area on the left would be immediately seen in the right hand project preview area. This solution abstracts away complexity and repetitive nature of asset placement mirroring a technique called tilemaps [@erhard-olsson_procedural_2018] used in GUI oriented game making tools (see glossary and Appendix.tech). While my design aim was in part to reduce coding syntax errors and thus reduce learner anxiety, I did not wish not to remove learner mistakes entirely. While even these small changes involved potential syntax errors, as these simple expressions were surrounded by other lines modelling the correct syntax, they could often be corrected by the participants without facilitator support. This chapter's vignette (Appendix 5.toby), where Toby designs many levels as a way of making his game distinct from others, illustrates the impact of this technical adaptation on the evolution of social coding processes a theme which is explored in more detail in a following section.


<!-- The possibility of disturbing the syntax of the  of code in the array. When participant did this it provided a good opportunity for facilitators or parents to outline the importance of correct syntax of and to explain the code structure. -->

<!-- OPTIONAL ADD AND APPENDIX ON LOAD LEVEL? -->
<!-- The possibility of disturbing the syntax of the  of code in the array. When participant did this it provided a good opportunity for facilitators or parents to outline the importance of correct syntax of and to explain the code structure. -->


<!-- ##### Design tensions in the authoring and incorporation of game assets -->

<!-- My observations supported these findings. Indeed, I observed a strong palpable a sense of achievement and satisfaction when participants succeeded in seeing and hearing their creations in their game after making the final changes in code.
For some, this sense of a achievement appeared magnified by difficulty caused by the unfamiliar environment and processes. As if they almost couldn't believe they had made an impact on the game world via interaction with such an alien language. -->

<!-- EVIDENCE? - code for this? -->
<!-- This aligns with educational research of the value of incorporating Funds of Knowledge into technical learning environments [Cole etc]. -->
<!-- While the value of this process seems clear from existing research, it presented challenges and design tensions in this learning design. -->

<!-- **Simple block graphics** -->

<!-- In P1 a template based on tutorial used stock graphics of a astronaut collecting stars on platforms resembling earth and grass. -->
<!-- The overall simplification reduced and therefore rebalanced time spent on to this activity compared to other game coding processes, thus helping resolve one of the tensions emerging in P1. -->

Turning to the use of graphical assets, the starting template was altered to facilitate and encourage the process of adding designs created by participants. Initial graphical assets consisted of colour blocks, a design choice inviting learners to develop game characters from a clean slate (see Figure 5.px). To help resolve the overly complicated use of multiple asset creation tools, I prioritised the use of the pixel art tool Piskel, as I evaluated it to be intuitive for many younger participants. In P2, participants were guided to make a game on a broadly environmental theme, participants often redesigned sprites to games involving animals. Figure 5.fish shows a whale as a player character and plastic bottles as a hazard and fish as an item to collect. The process of game art and audio creation opportunities seeding narrative and artistic creativity is explored in more detail in Chapter 5.

<!-- DROP shift to appendix? I had previously set the dimensions of the matrix above based on this size to create a resulting game size of 550, 400, in line with a retro game style.  -->

While I made several technical alignments to facilitate the swapping in of participant graphical designs (outlined in Appendix 5.tech), the process still required a series of potentially tricky operations.  While some novice code authoring tools adopt a self-contained to audio and graphical asset creation and by providing in-built authoring tools and a library of assets, the code playground Glitch provided neither, thus requiring the use of Piskel as an external asset creation tool, thus complicating the process. The forced choice to use a distributed toolset rather than black-boxing asset management and migration led to benefits in developing key digital literacy needed for web creation. Some participants became remarkably adapt at the complex process of migrating assets from Piskel into their games, transforming the chain of actions involved into fluid operations.

<!-- In line with existing research, in P1 I observed participant showing a high motivation to incorporate assets based on their hope interests.

<!-- I was concerned that in P1 the diversity of asset creation tools approaches was over complicated creating an increased burden of learning different software, reducing the shared experience helpful for peer learning and risking distracting time and attention from coding activities.

<!-- The in-tool affordances were designed to allow a quicker building of participant familiarity with the toolset via aligning with changes which were familiar from home experience of games and which were simple to change and provoking high feedback from the target game. -->


### C2 - Contradictions associated with project navigation and use of documentation


<!-- The previous section addresses changes to primary tools used to create game code and assets and response to the emerging tensions experienced by participants in P1. -->

<!-- Before outlining tensions related to technical demands on facilitator time in this section and the subsequent introduction of supporting forms of documentation, some brief observations on impact are useful.  -->

The introduction of a half-baked template and UMC approach had the unintended consequences of reducing the average working group size helped issues of some being alienated from the group process if not working on the code changes, and  also helped by introducing coding tools early thus avoiding the mismatch between participant planning and the technical limits of the novice ability. However, an additional negative consequence of the greater the number of games being worked was an increased demand on my time as a technical trouble shooter of code problems. This section addresses this tension and others related to the introduction of supporting forms of documentation.  

<!-- The in-tool scaffolding within primary tool outlined in the previous section aligns with microworld concepts  of affordances guiding learners towards the exploration of key concepts and reduced reliance on facilitator instruction [@laurillard2020significance], an alignment explored in more detail in this chapters' discussion. -->

While the in-tool scaffolding within primary tool outlined in the previous section reduced initial reliance on facilitator instruction [@laurillard2020significance], it did not aid participants wanting to implement new features or add code structures into their game (e.g. the _Create_ stage of UMC). In P1 and early in P2 my guidance and often direct help adding or altering code structures was needed at this stage, causing delays and participant frustration due to my limited time with each participant or pair. The documentation created in P1 lacked coherence in approach and any system for users to navigate the resources created.

In the development period (DA) after P1 reflection on the tension between learner agency, in particular the role of divergent participant learning paths, and the role of facilitator-led instruction and support reoccurs consistently in my notes at this time. My reflection was partly driven by two attempts in P1 of whole class instruction of key coding concepts that I judged to be relevant to the wider group. My reflection on these interventions noted that in learners engagement was low, surmising perhaps that learners viewed this instruction as not immediately relevant, as alien to their favoured hands on style of working, or as an interruption to the flow of their making activities. This observation aligns with the concept of just-in-time learning approaches within project based approaches[@riel1998education], where access of supporting documentation is provided based on learner-need. In the D1 development period, I struggled with how to resolve my desire to support this responsive approach with requests from some from parents in the feedback to P1 to also provide background concepts and explanations of coding constructs. The design and implementation of supporting resources continued to evolve at a frantic pace at the start of P2 and I finally created three main sources of documentation: quick start cards, written instructions and code snippets which are outlined in the following section.


<!-- or a nagivational , especially when combined with the disparate approach to graphical and audio asset creation, had resulted in an overly complex object. -->
<!-- DOES THE LR EXPLORE THIS TENSION? -->
<!-- PERHAPS? ILLUSTRATE THIS WITH A TRIANGLE - see notes 23.8.24 -->

<!-- REWORD
While step-by-step instruction could build up experience with tools and concepts in a carefully structured way, I wanted to preserve the choice driven approach and motivational potential of hands-on  project-based approaches employed in P1 [@holstermann_hands-activities_2010].   -->


<!-- ##### Linear and stand-alone tutorials and code snippet resources -->

<!-- Longer form step by step tutorials are common in computing education. Examples can be found in Code Academy, and in the education resources of RPi foundation. Many examples talking learners through steps to build a game can be found online with varied amount of explanation of underlying constructs and concepts. I started my journey learning JS games using some provided
by Mozilla and the Phaser developers. -->

#### The use of documentation to address contradictions

This section looks at the introduction of quick start cards, instructional documents and code snippets to address some of the contradictions of the learning design outline above. Quick start cards, supporting simple print outs drawing attention to key affordances of the template outline above, became a key resource used to get started in using the starting template game. During the development period D1, I used the revised template design in a one-off game making with computer trainee teacher computing students. I ended with a challenge to create an activity for one-off holiday activities around creative game coding for families. In response, three students created printable word documents highlighting key affordances of the design in a way which mirrored my facilitation of their game making session. Specifically, the printed resources highlighted the key lines of code and how they can be altered to impact on game behaviour (see figure 5.x below).

![](./Pictures/velocity_jscard.png){width=95%}
4.x - Example of a Quick start card

At this stage the options involved, the game mechanics of movement, jumping, level design, and final challenge to swap out the look of one or more of the characters by designing pixel art, and swapping out the line of code that adds the asset to the game. A version of the quick start cards are available online and as part of Appendix.tech [^].

These _quick start_ cards supported participants initial interaction with the code in a way strongly aligned with the _use_ and _modify_ stages of the UMC framework [@franklin_analysis_2020]. The start process addressed the tension concerning the issue of providing documentation with support for users to be able complete coding tasks but also facilitate choice over learner pathways.

##### Structuring instructional tutorial resources and code snippets

<!-- BELOW Initially I structured the book chapter participants working their way through the online resources. HOW -->

<!-- While writing self-contained tutorials added a challenge to the documentation authouring process, the documents, especially when printed became a vital resource for this community. In chapter 5 I explore the extent to which these resources can scale for use beyond this context. -->

To meet participantsâ€™ requests for foundational coding knowledge, in D1, I developed an online manual with step-by-step chapters guiding users through coding the core template structure. While this linear format did not fully align with my choice-led face-to-face sessions, I envisioned it as supplementary reinforcement for learning outside of sessions. Writing these chapters revealed a technique that helped balance structured guidance with choice-driven learning. Each chapter demonstrated a code feature or principle through a playable game project based on the core game template hosted in an online code playground. While the use of code examples or _snippets_ are a common professional practice in problem-solving [@yang_stack_2017], their use by novice learners presents challenges related to relevance, consistency, and accessibility [@treude_understanding_2017]. Initially, I had encouraged participants to use code snippets from the Phaser website, but their difficulties understanding and applying these abstracted examples prompted me to create more tailored resources.

I later extended this approach by creating standalone code snippets that illustrated requested game features as gameplay design patterns, such as _jumping on an enemy to zap it_ and _making a moving enemy_ (see Appendix.toby for an applied example). In the early stages  of P2, learners accessed these projects through a simple Google document with links and brief descriptions. I continued developing new projects and producing printable instructions to support these code snippets, ensuring that each snippet linked to a descriptive chapter and vice versa. To help learners situate the code within the correct structure, all projects used the core game template and included only the new code required for each feature.

I also experimented with ways to present these feature choices in an accessible, engaging format, which I describe in detail in Appendix 5.map. Recognising that multiple documentation formats sometimes led to confusion, I created a centralised hub to host both snippets and tutorial chapters, making navigation more intuitive and orienting documentation towards participants' gameplay experience.

<!-- My rationale was that each pattern added builds familiarity with the code structure. -->

<!-- To address this tension, in addition to self-contained chapter focused on instrumental code changes needed to implement game features, I created opening chapters of the online manual which were more traditional in format and explained underlying concepts that the starting template had initially abstracted away from the participants. -->

<!-- **Return to vignette**

Returning to the vignette of the child Toby described earlyer in this chapter we can see him use, rather than the written step-by-step help, jump into the code example, searching for the new code constructs and in-line code comments notes in the code highlighting their purpose.

Thus, while not proof of overall efficacy of the use of code snippets the pattern of behaviour of Toby in the implementation of code is promising.

Chapter 2 reviewed research on using collections of gameplay design patterns to support learning in game design [@holopainen2007teaching; @holopainen2011foundations; @eriksson_using_2019; @bjork_patterns_2005]. Thematic organisation of these patterns shows potential to foster a shared understanding of game-making concepts within a coding community [@holopainen2011foundations]. For the documentation hub described above, I grouped game design patterns into categories based on academic and professional interpretations of game elements [@salen_game_2006; @schell_art_2008; @tekinbas_rules_2003; @olsson2014conceptual], as well as participantsâ€™ evolving requests for game features. The final categorisation used in P4 is shown below in Table 5.x.

#### Resolution of C2

This section outlined two key types of secondary support tools developed in response to tensions arising after introducing the primary tools discussed in the previous section. While the code snippets, practical instructions, and chapters on core principles continued to pose some challenges (as seen in vignette 6.S with Suzanna and T), the video data analysed in the following chapter shows an increase in participantsâ€™ practical ability to implement game features, suggesting an enhancement in their instrumental agency. In addition, participants' increase in agency extends beyond just instrumental application. In both P1 and P2, participants made specific requests for new features, which, when deemed suitable by me as the facilitator, were added to the menu of game design patterns. This choice-driven approach can be seen as both relational and authorial agency within the framework discussed in Chapter 3.

### C3 - Responding to tensions and barriers in cultural aspects of the game making activity

<!-- ### Design narrative on conflict due to identity clashes and dysfunctional group work -->

<!-- **Participants stuck / demotivated : scope of ambition to high,   collaboration groups too big (transition),** -->

Some participants felt alienated when transitions shifted to coding not only due to tool use but a sense of alienation from the culture of coding, an experiences which aligns with research on cultural exclusion from coding processes explored in Chapter 2 [SEVERAL REFERENCES] [@kafai_constructionist_2015-1]. As explored in a previous section, in P1 my opening design employed several non-coding techniques to promote positive affect to form an inclusive idioculture to avoid alienation from foreign coding tools. While these were noted as positive in P1 feedback,  several tensions compounded for the family described in Appendix 5.bee to create a conflict  composed of accumulating tensions from alienation from the group coding environment and associated peer working dynamics which they resolved by choosing not to continue with the activity. The transition from the non-code creative activities to enacting them with code that spurred alienation from a perceived culture of hard core coding at that stage of the process.  While there were technical aspects to the conflict, these were compounded with more social and cultural barriers that also arose.

<!-- These activities including starter games and game playing on entry and sharing of gaming experience of let laptops with games installed on them. -->

![tensions with cultural layers](./Pictures/At_tension_2_v1.png){width=95%}

Fig 5.x - Tensions involving cultural aspects of the game making process

Members of this family had engaged in planning on paper and in particularly in creating pixel art, however tensions began to emerge when the introduced code framework  did not support the desired features of one child. The feature they wanted to add to the game was bee design roaming a 3D landscape.  

In participant feedback, the  parent of one  family described in Appendix 5.x indicated that it took too long before in the planning stage and called for more hands on play and use of the tools of production before being called on to make creative decisions. The parent likened this to an arts studio approach.

The feedback given in particular by this family  surfaced some key matters of concern for this design. Firstly, the fragility of learners ongoing positive affect towards the group game making process caused by a transition from planning, sketching phase of the design process to code enactment.  Secondly,  a danger that those more confident in coding create more involved code problems that need more facilitator time, potentially making others feel less valued. Thirdly, it highlighted the limits of what peer support from fellow participants could provide (explored in appendix).  

This reflection on this conflict motivate several changes in the learning design in the plane of cultural activity.  While Chapter 7 analyses the participant reactions to the design in this more cultural dimension, here I (try to) limit exploration to the evolution of key learning design features addressing this aspect, namely the identification and nurturing of social coding processes.

<!--
NOTE MOVE
Chapter 6 analyses the potential of activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers in more depth, in particular in relation to dimensions of participant agency. -->


#### Social coding processes

While changes in the tools, documentation use were initially designed to solve technical problems, they also impacted the culture of the coding group.
In particular the starting template/ half baked template, had particular impact on division of labour, and a knock on positive impact on general engagement.

DOES THIS GO EARLIER?
Despite relative simplicity of the highlighted affordances, complex and divergent style and feel of games emerged at these early stages and the use of collection of code examples that participants could choose prompted greater diversity still. In particular the starting template had particular impact on division of labour, allowing participants to work by themselves or with a family members, this had a knock on positive impact on general engagement.

The value of peer social experiences which emerged naturally at in P2 was such that for P3 I sought to intervene gently to encourage them.

<!-- In journal notes, I observed that the shift of process in terms of division of labour from  P1 to P2 afforded by the introduction of a _half-baked_ template. The use of a starting template and scaffolded use and modify early activities increased the number of games being made as it reduced the typical working group to individuals or pairs. -->

Starting from a playable if incomplete game and adapting it, greatly increased the amount of time participants spent playtesting their own and other games. I noted my own concern if errors compounded to make the participants game unplayable for any extended time. In video data, participants show frustration if not able to playtest game due to errors (for a clear example see Olivia and Suzanna's frustration in Appendix 5.x.)

My broad observations align with / EXTEND? the supported benefits outlined in research on the Use-Modify-Create (UMC)  [-@lytle_use_2019-1] and particularly the technique of starting with  half baked games [@grizioti_game_2018-1]. IT THIS RIGHT? OR DO THEY ADD ANYTHING?

<!-- SHIFT? - It is notable that the create stage of this model does not involve starting a totally new game from scratch as is imagined in some interpretations of that model. Due to the complexity of the code base and framework the process of creating a new GDP within the game as a suitable level of challenge. -->

In P2, while the process of peer playtesting was encouraged it was not explicitly guided. Fortuitously, complex patterns of playtesting emerged rapidly which are explored in chapter 7.

CAN THIS BE A MORE CONSISE VIA A LINK?


##### Remixing, peer learning, and choice of starting template MERGE UP

**Tension of a group remixing from one template rather than feeler community inspiration and interaction**

To address issues of a practical nature to get starting coding, a restriction in game genre and was made in the form of a starting template, thus restricting personal choice, in a way which negatively impacted some families (see appendix 5.bee). In addition no online community was promoted to motivate inspiration from the work of others,  collaboration and peer review via comments [@monroy-hernandez_cooperation_nodate; @cress_supporting_2016]. However some positive aspects inherent to this design choice.

- In practical terms, it simplified the process of supporting code errors,

- it spurred community inspiration and interaction, peer support, sharing and problem solving due to the use of similar code bases.



##### Use of side missions to encourage varied creative practices


In appendix 5.playertypes, I outline the use of a game to explore different game playing types. I then proposed different making types. I used the question "What kind of game maker are you?" as an indicator to participants that one aim of the project was to create a space where different approaches are possible and celebrated.

![Illustration 4.x - What kind of game maker are you  ](./Pictures/kindofgamemaker.png){width=95%}

To communicate this approach, as well as starting game activity, I incorporated the question into an animation of the resources home page (see illustration 4.x). In P3 the underlying ideas were incorporated into the process drama described in the next section.


One of the activities that participants carried out within the frame of the fictional scenario  was the undertaking of side-missions. The motivations of introducing this drama process and social missions were to reinforce social and cultural elements many of which emerged during semi-structured playtesting. In this section I analyse these missions within the AT concept of dual stimulation.  

These missions encouraged community-focused patterns of behaviour which I had observed in previous iterations of game making and via the game on playing and making types described above. These were activities not directly related to game making process. They were designed to encourage the exploration of the games of others, to encourage a playful approach. I had identified these behaviours as potentially helpful in maintaining the positive affect and identification with the on-going group process of game making. An extract of the table of both social and secret missions follows (a full table is available as Appendix 4.x). These mission were printed out on cards and one of each type was given to the participants in the first half of the first two sessions.

**Link to discussion**

This is an incomplete picture of the missions and drama process, for reason of space and focus of research questions, I have de-prioritised the detail of the drama process element of the intervention of P3, an aspect that I will return to in the conclusion of this thesis when outlining possible next steps of research.

<!-- The impact of social missions and playtesting are described in more detail in chapter 7. -->

## Chapter Discussion

This chapter has explored the complexity of the interacting tools and documentation in relation to their evolution in different phases of the formative intervention process. The contradictions explored have initially had a focused on technical and then more social dimensions of the learning design, a process which has surfaced some of the barriers to achieving computational fluency needed to complete the text coding of a multi-media project.
HAS IT?
REVISIT RESEARCH QUESTIONS

The next section begins a synthesises the features of the design narrative, existing research, specifically UMC, half-baked approach and constructionist design principles. To do this it employs an argumentative grammar fusing elements of DBR and CHAT concepts: specifically iterative processes, analysis of emerging tensions between systems elements, focus on affordances and secondary stimuli (particularly in relation to participant agency), and the process of rising to the concrete through exploration of a germ cell concept.

Addressing the replicability of the research process, it is of value here to recap the previous chapters characterision of its nature as as open and risky, and requiring me to rapidly generate new tools in response. Certain factors mitigated against the incomplete design, namely a tenatious group of participants in P1, and my existing relationship with some participants built in previous encounters. The input of families as a responsive testing group and as detailed above, as active inputters to the evolving pedagogical approach was significant. As such, while this aspect is not extensively explored in this study, I propose there is significant potential in the input of home educating families as a consituant part in collaborative design based approaches to  uncover exisiting, situated repetoires in a way that can shape emergent practices in new learning expereiences. Specifically potential to can inform design  to produce tools and pedagogies aims which can help other facilitators seed productive community activity in other learning settings. I return to this subject in the conclusion of this thesis.

The emergent and mutual nature of this design process align with both DBR and CHAT principles. In this and the previous chapter I have described my active role to motivate and support an emerging community in iterative phases. I have designed, introduced and revised a technology based set of tools in a process aligned with broad definitions of DBR.  In addition to the affordances of technical tools, I have introduced learning activities as pedagogy strategies which can be seen as affordances, an approach also aligned with DBR research. The term affordances has been well explored in the literature of HCI from a CHAT perspective, as 'technology affordances as possibilities for human actions mediated by cultural means' [@kaptelinin_affordances_2012, p.927]. In 3GAT terminology, the affordances of my design would be terms as a series secondary stimuli. Sannino's work draws our attention to the intersection of the use of secondary stimuli by participants and volitional action or agency of participants.

<!-- DBR and affordances explored as networked affordances align with tools not only as technical or perceptual affordances but also mediation using concepts and more social practices or repertoires in CHAT [@barab_curriculum-based_2006]. -->

The following chapters explore shifts to the overall structure of participant activity that can be said to align more closely with the concepts of relational agency supported by playtesting and social coding processes and transformative agency.
SIGNPOSTING

The evolution of these tools and practice affordances can at a foundational level as increasing instrumental agency by removing the need to understand concepts or use tools which were beyond the skill level of the participants. This more foundation level is explored in relation to other research in the following section.

**Comparing to UMC,  Microworlds & constructionist design priniciples**


<!-- MOVED INTEGRATE
While much the focus of much constructionist research  is on the design of toolsets to facilitate to personal knowledge building and expression via open project work, more recent work from researchers in this school has started to embrace the value of situated, community driven production as a lens [@kafai_theory_2020]. -->
<!-- MOVED INTEGRATE
The evolution of the starting template aligned with UMC approaches; constructionist design heuristics; and the concept of affordances understood from a socio-cultural perspective   -->


This chapter has described my responsive design process which provoked me to introduce strategies in P1, which I then identified in relevant research in D1 used to develop the design further in later stages. This process of praxis is present in the use of a starting half-baked game template where I draw on the of Kynigos et al [-@kynigos_children_2018] to focus on user feedback and motivation of incomplete game affordances,
and in the application of research on UMC literature research in:
-  the use of a working template build familiarity with the code structure and use of tools in an accelerated way.
- a  structured approach in for participants in use and modify stages where key affordances were highlighted in the code design.
-  the careful design of stages of participant interaction with code via guiding documentation terms of quick start cards and a participatory creation of a menu of gameplay design patterns.


INTEGRATE  
Small code changes resulted in potentially large changes in game behaviour, appearance and difficulty aligns with a long standing concept of HCI research that feedback is motivating for system users [@bernhaupt_introduction_2015; @malone_heuristics_1982].  

A more extensive set of design heuristics can be found in  constructionist research on design decisions made in creating a Microworld environment and the development of Scratch [@resnick_design_2005]. Techniques or concepts which are embodied in the tool set of this intervention also present in constructionism include: a simplified code authoring environment that provides live feedback of the results of code in a preview window, techniques to avoid and help correct code syntax errors via the use of the linting (see glossary) abilities of the code-playground and the technique to, and encouraging creative but scaffolded design via a GDP menu.

A greater description of these element are explored in specific detail in the conclusion of Appendix.tech.

<!-- -  supporting immediacy of creative process by providing a library of assets. -->


Of particular relevant to the process of this design is the  constructionist design principles, choose black boxes carefully.  Resnick [@resnick_reflections_2005] explains the designing of black boxes as the process of as abstracting away areas potentially problematic areas of the production process, creating a kind of border between the participants experience with the protective environment of the scaffolded learning experience and a more open ecology of learning from code in the wild. Additionally, black boxes allow the learning designer to steer participants away from those that have been hidden and thus towards features affording the exploration of certain concepts, a process well illustrated Papert's focus on powerful mathematical ideas explored via Turtle control in LOGO.


The use of black boxes is also common in professional coding practices in the use of a code libraries which abstract away complexities. In my design, The phaser game making library provides underlying code structures dealing with of aspects of gravity, and physics calculated required to handle collisions between objects, and I structured the code of the template to further simplify allowing participants to alter gravity settings of the game via simple change to one code variable.

<!-- These game-specific aspects are more complex to implement. in the broader multi-media focused Scratch tool despite its . The choice of black boxes are different.    -->

My design decision   to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and authentic tools and by abstracting away complexity and highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency,
However, the use of an authentic coding language in the form of javascript, and developer tool in glitch.com has not been simplified, thus  the barriers is more porous, like a  protective harbour still connected to the wilder sea.

The careful choice of affordances by the microworld designer, to structure user experimentation, which Laurillard notes reduces dependence on instruction or direct facilitator input.
DEVELOP THIS - DIAGRAM?

Thus I propose this design as a form of Microworld, although one with much more porous boarders between this world and other more authentic coding ecosystems.

This is relevant to my design's focus on different dimensions of agency. I proposed that increased scaffolding of learner resources and tools can increase instrumental agency for novice coders but at the potential cost of reducing access to the tools and processes of authentic creative communities. Thus authentic and therefore complex Rather than a barrier to be designed away, this can be better understood as an inherent dialectical tension, which learning designers should take into account.


<!-- **tsp**
Additionally, the concept of task specific programming language within that process is relevant as affordances in my design are chosen not only to impact on the game, but also to build familiarity with code structures. -->

**the potentially awesome impact of lifting the lid on authentic technologies**

It is of value here to re-examining factors driving choice of an authentic choice of JavaScript code and the professional, open source library, specifically the potentially awesome impact of lifting the lid on authentic technologies a factor. Lifting the lid on hidden technologies and concepts in hands-on, exploratory processes can be empowering for participants. Ratto explores this via critical making [@ratto_critical_2011], a process which playfully surfaces Latour's [@weibel_making_2005; @latour_cautious_2008] concepts of shifting matters of fact to matters of concern by exposing taken for granted artefacts as objects that have been designed (for better or worse). Conversations between participants showing an inspirational or engaging impact on previously unknown technology. For examples, exchanges among participants that communicated a sense of awe of how much effort and coding must be involved in a professional game based on the relative complexity of the code of their simple game.    

    Pearl: It just shows you what goes into these games.
    Student Helper 3: Think about how much effort goes into.
    Pearl: You just take things for granted donâ€™t you?

Conversely, a significant drawback of using a bespoke tool for novices is that attempts to progress by stepping outside of that protective area risk culture shock and alienation from the newly unfamiliar environment.


<!-- Aligned with the general principles of PBL [@hung_engaged_2006], this design has strived for authenticity in varied forms. Authenticity in terms of activity object here is multiple in dimension, e.g in audience, in tool use and in creative processes. While the impact of the authentic dimensions of the tools and process described in this chapter 7 in depth, this section outlines some of the rationale of design descriptions in relation to existing research. -->


**Rising to the concrete - the emergence of GDPs as a germ cell of activity**

The process of rising to the concrete via a germ cell concept,  while not seen as a requirement for formative interventions [Sannino etc], it is seen as powerful in potential. To seek it, the researcher engages in an exploration of complex, messy concrete processes is undertaken over time to try to discern overarching concerns which can be expressed as a prototypical abstract germ cell concept.

<!-- NOTE Blunden and Engestrom's disagreement about unit of analysis -->

For this learning design, the concept and pedagogy of working with game design patterns emerged not only as an object of activity on a more granular scope than typical, but also as guiding germ cell concept which helps participant and facilitators. In the discussion below, GDPs are noted in their use in step-wise instruction processes. Using terminology outlined by Denner et al. [@denner_does_2019], the P1 to P2 shift saw a move from a design-build-test to a stepwise approach. Step wise approaches comprises broadly of a fundamental coding approach which is introduced in simplistic, proto-typical format for learners to experience and explore, and which is then replaced by a more advanced model or more complicated instance of the task.

Thus while the initial use of GDPs in P1 was piecemeal, by P2, a more structured, step-wise approach was present for participants. This following summative narrative outlines of the use of GDPs which were introduced as part of several guiding activities. In P1 GDPs identified via playing games as part of an activity adapted from Moveable Game Jams (check this is described or linked to) and used in list of features used as a mediating planning tool. In P2 GDPs were incorporated as affordances into a starter game template  highlighted first via facilitator interaction and then as the guiding priniciple of _quick start cards_ to scaffold modification of code template.  The sructure of documentaiton  created in response to participant requests to add new GDPs to their games evolved from a piecemeal in P1 to by the end of P2 as a menu of GDPs code snippets and accompnying instructional documentation.

In line with understandings of DBR research outputs, the identification and use of these patterns as research findings would be expressed a set of "tentative generalisations" in the form of design heuristics drawn from analysis of concrete practices [@hoadley_design-based_2022, p.215]. Similarly, I propose the orienting practice of GDPs as tentative candidate for a germ cell concept. I continue analysis of this proposition in the following chapter.

<!-- NOTE - DROP - MAKE MORE DIRECT
While the scope of this study is not on the micro-level of tool use, it is useful to collate some broad observations from my journal notes and video data on how participants used the new tools introduced. This is done in relation dimensions of complexity exposed in research on educational coding tools. -->

**Synthesis effect of UMC + collection of GDPS on agency**

My observations indicated that the combination of the use of a template and a collection of GDPs via a guided approaches had an accelerated effect on a specific set of coding fluency practices. This, in turn, had subsequent impact on the increase use of social coding processes.

This instrumental proficiency was required before the rich set of  interaction based on peer learning, and other social coding processed could emerge in playtesting practices. While a simple point, Matusov's typology of agency, omits to state that instrumental agency can be seen as the base of a triangular hierarchy of agency, in other words that other dimensions of agency may needs to be built on this one.

<!-- LATER? My choices balanced the value of positive engagement of asset creating, development of digital literacy skills associated with web production, and a focus on promoting code modification.   -->

Relational agency developed via Playtesting as a process and the use of GDPs in varied ways by participants was noticed and I added more affordances designed to facilitate these aspects.
In addition, design  affordances here as a form of delegated agency.

Authorial Agency in this learning process was present via the input of participants in the overall design of the program.


**Summary and link to next chapter/s**


This chapter has dealt with the evolution of design in initial phases and responses to learner experience to resolve tensions. A key focus of this chapter has been  barriers to computer coding and use of particular software. I have explored alignment with the results research from the constructionist school.

Chapter 7 explores the delivery and start to explore the impact of the and emerging community processes on cultural dimensions of the game making activity on participants development of agency.

The next chapter explores the varied uses of a gameplay design patterns. In this study the patterns take the form of working with common game elements game design patterns.

### Perhaps reintegrate above

MOVE THIS PART TO CHAPTER 3?

Following Barab's description of nested activity systems [-@barab_using_2002], this shared system, whose objective is to make a games for an audience to play,  can be seen not only as nested within the wider systems but also as a container for  other  activity systems nested with that. While this overall approach is considered valid [FIND OTHER SUPPORT], the danger of fragmenting activity to much is to make matters confusing. The job of the researcher is to prioritise systems to describe and analyse based on the area of study and the concerns of the participants.

This prioritisation in AT is sometimes conceptualised as the process of finding a key units of analysis. In the process of research I have found two units of activity particularly illuminating, one being the shared activity system described above of making a game in a community process. The other, narrower in scope can be described as implementing individual game features.

Beyond these key systems, I draw on the concepts of actions and operations within systems to describe tensions and contradictions which emerge in the research process [-@leontiev_activity_2009].


MOVE THIS TO CHAPTER 7 -
A student helper shares a question -  "Is yours the one where level one is harder than level three?". This is indicative of some of the emerging playful approaches that younger participants in particular are taking to the overall process. This represents an example of the influence of the wider systems of play of on the shared idioculture of the game making community. The complexities of processes to create and to help resolve contradictions as this cultural domain of collective making are explored later in this chapter.





#### MOVED LINK - Applying activity theory to surface contradictions and design tensions experienced by participants and facilitator/s

NOTE - THIS WAS INTERUPTING FLOW - SO MOVED HERE

Identifying shifts in participant activity in terms of scope facilitates analysis of the complex and interwoven cultural, social and personal actions in a communities activity [@rogoff_observing_1995]. Above, Toby shifts between the wider activity of making a game and sharing it with peers and narrower actions implementing concrete code structures. This aspect is developed in chapter five.

In addition  analysis of community processes also involves transformation over time.  The next section offers a description of the evolution of tool use in different phases of the study with an aim to situate analysis of emerging tensions in the use of tools, resources and processes in the following section.

The followings sections use a process of analysis of contradictions between system elements of the activity systems outlined above. The processes is a formative intervention (explored in chapter three) in that the surfacing of tensions due to changes in the learning design over time are examined. As noted in the introduction, this chapter explores the following areas of contradictions: contradictions in the technical tool use of design, contradictions shaping the development of supporting documentation, contradictions to do with issues of identity and the cultural dimension of participation.

<!-- For example a common contradiction may be an immediate goal of children to mess around, play games and have fun while the goals of parent may be to maximise the acquisition of skills -->

<!-- I chart the detail of the evolution of resources and other responses used helps illuminate broader, systemic issues concerns in the overall activity [@barab_using_2002]. -->


#### Notes from vignette


<!-- Objectives at this level also vary between participants with some more straight-forward and others more tricky based on their making style. For example, beyond a purely utilitarian objective, a further objective in implementing a GDP, e.g. a new graphical element may be to increase a sense of personal identification with the game as an vehicle for personal expression. -->


<!-- One observation from he experimental course was that without signific
**Phase one:** In response to need, I adapted a starting code template of a platform game and created various code examples to add functionality requested by participants. This template was adapted from an online tutorial to create a game of the _platformer_ genre  (see glossary), a move which helped to limit expectations of the technical complexity of their game. At the end of this stage participants showcased their games to students in the foyer of the MMU Brooks building.

<!-- In line with the process outlined in chapter three, the following sections outline different scopes of activity to introduce tensions between system elements which are explored in this chapter. -->



<!-- The following descriptions mirror the work of AT researchers who conceptualise scope of activity as concentric circles from Broffennbrenner with "larger" scopes of cultural and societal goals and smaller, narrower, lower scopes of more personal activity [Engestrom][Cole]. -->

<!-- While the limited example above of Toby's activity illustrates fun, additional data from interviews with this child and family back the broad goals above. [develop - perhaps an appendix or quotes] -->

<!-- As previously explored this mirrors the Activity, Action and Operation hierarchy. -->

#### Notes before C1


<!-- ADD THIS FUNCTIONALITY OF ASSET AREA TO DESCRIPTIO OF CODE PLAYGROUND
A key element of game creation is the creation and management of graphical and audio assets.  -->


<!-- I began by mirroring social model of learning like CoL and CoP and their propose apprenticeship-based approaches. Specifically, introducing possible code solutions to implement the ideas of participants. However, limits to my time involvement and my technical fluency hindered this process creating stress in myself and frustration and hesitancy on participants to get direct help.

    NOTE - Examples drop?
    For example, to troubleshoot a code error might take between one minute and 10 minutes depending on the complexity of it. To work with participants to identify and then implement a new coding structure could take up to 30 minutes.

    At times I was able to identify a discreet new code construct and to implement an example of this between sessions. At times I would attempt to do this in the group setting with varying results.

    Other interventions were called for directly by parents. Two relevant and relates requests happened at the end of P1.

    One was a call for more hands on play and use of the tools of production before being called on to make creative decisions. The parent likened this to an studio approach. Another was a request for additional supporting resources which explained the coding structures used in accessible but detailed ways. A request which hinted at a more structured, instruction based approach.

    However, interview data from participants placed great value on the flexibility of the approach which allowed participants to choose what they wanted to add to their game next. -->


<!-- Based on group work with adults on creating media projects together I created an email group that all participants could post to to ask for help. However this option was hardly ever used taken up. I was given feedback from one parent that asking on for technical help via an email forum not something that they felt comfortable doing. The same family also gave useful feedback about social norms of not bothering people getting in the way of asking for help.

Thus other ways of addressing this conflict were called for. -->

<!-- The need to get started somewhere emerged - and the template was a response to that.
Just an immediate, intuitive way to bring something to the table as a starting point to develop. The template was based on a prominent tutorial on the phaser website called Making your first game.

 -->


 #### Dropped from c1

 After this shared first change, participants next choices varied greatly. While some participants engaged with extensive experimentation to find a player movement feel that seemed just right, others,  were much less concerned with this aspect of game play, despite sometime frustrating resulting player movement.

 Data explored in the next chapter supports foundational claims of constructionist computing and UMC advocates  that greater user choice over the design process contributes to participant motivational and a feeling ownership of their projects [@lytle_use_2019; @peppler_computer_2009]


#### Dropped from Discussion

<!-- This is a long-running theme of constructionist research, with roots in Papert concept of Microworlds, typically embodied by the Mathland environment, where participants control a robotic turtle with lines of simplified LOGO code language.  Because the turtle speaks only LOGO, children are drawn to speak LOGO to progress. Thus, Scratch and Mircoworlds can be seen as digital playgrounds with affordances that encourage certain types of play. -->

<!-- The next section begins by discussing how authentic tools and processes, while challenging for novices, can be addressed using existing of key design principles. -->

<!-- IS THIS USEFUL HERE? LATER? NEXT CHAPTER?
RQ2 addresses uses the term computational fluency, which as explored in chapter 2, is a better fit for the aims of this study than computational thinking, given the former's increased focus on agency and a more concrete, accessible approach.   -->



<!-- At some point in this process I realised that I wanted to encourage the growth of computational fluency.

That was not clear, the use of computational thinking also jumped out from a sense of wanting to fit into the common frameworks of this area. But this approach had always seemed too abstract as a form of repertoire to me. More hands on specific repertoires to do with the logistics of more concrete tasks suited the high impact from minimal input approach, made particularly relevant given the difficulty of using a code environment. -->

 <!-- in line with wider conceptions of PBL and UDL.

  - particpant voice and choice
  - peer learning and ongoing sharing of process via product
  - reduced class instructions
  - avoiding stuckness
  - linking to authentic practices and commuities

While computational fluency is a valid of the objectives of the game making activity goal, this chapter has (re)surfaced the many barriers to achieving this via the text coding of a multi-media project. -->

<!-- MOVE TO CH.7?
Participants are able to leave the protective harbour by accessing more authentic documentation and moving beyond existing templates. The experience may be involve choppier waters but the tools and processes remain familiar. -->



### Moved from Graphical Assets above

This technical solution had a positive impact on engagement with game coding and allowed social elements of coding processes to evolve

MOVE THIS PART SOMEWHERE ELSE
This adaptation is one example of how a technical solution had a positive impact on engagement with game coding and allowed social elements of coding processes to evolve.

Many participants spending significant time and effort undertaking many iterations of changes to the level design .  

An illustrative example of the impact of is explored via a vignette in appendix 5.toby where child participant Toby designs many levels as a way of making his game distinct from others (include BETTER SUMMARY).

Participants varied in their approach to level design, some drew on their experiences to mirrors platform game conventions, while others enjoyed working against these conventions, a theme which is explored in more detail in a following section  - SIGNPOST


MOVE
My observations in P1 aligned with research on the motivational value of the ability for young people to bring their interests into multimedia creations via choice of assets and narratives [@kajamaa_digital_2018; @resnick2014give; @peppler_supergoo_2007].

MOVE
A full table of the tools used and their purposes created to help orientate participants in P1 are outlined in 5.tech. The use of many production processes and asset creation tools in P1 complicated the object of activity in a way which I evaluated as negatively impacting the leading activity and motivation of making a game to share. Thus in P2 I reduced the number of suggested tool address this overcomplication. I now outline and discuss the use of simple block graphics, the use of pixel art authoring tool, and wider asset creation approaches.

MMOVE TO APPENDIX.TECH
with three main areas: a set of editing tools; a canvas for creation; and a set of tools to export, save and import work . The size of the colour block in the starter template were  32 x 32 to align with the default project size of Piskel to reduce technical friction when designing and swapping in new graphical resources. This standardisation also helped resolve a complications encountered in P1 due to differing sizes of sprites created using different graphical tools.

MOVED
Participants would identify the need for an asset in their game. They would then use the separate software to create that asset, and the be supported to save assets to their computer's hard drive in a compatible format. They would then need to upload assets to the code playground environment, discover the text link of the asset, and then insert that link into the main JavaScript game file at the relevant line of code.

### Removed from Docs - add to appendix .tech

<!-- My rationale was that each pattern added builds familiarity with the code structure. -->

<!-- To address this tension, in addition to self-contained chapter focused on instrumental code changes needed to implement game features, I created opening chapters of the online manual which were more traditional in format and explained underlying concepts that the starting template had initially abstracted away from the participants. -->



As introducing diverse forms of documentation and the resulting over complexity of the shared object of activity on a community level resulted in some users failing or struggling to find the right resources online, I designed and introduced a themed hub for both snippets and tutorial chapters. My aim was to mitigate potential learner alienation from unfamiliar technical documentation through accessible design which, in line with x, oriented access to documentation to participants existing gameplay experience rather than underlying coding constructs.

![Pattern Collection](./Pictures/pattern_collection_1.png){width=95%}


The use of code snippets, while a promising authentic practice, presented challenges which this careful curation of examples aimed to overcome. As explored in chapter two, while the use of code examples or snippets in code playgrounds is a common professional problem solving practice [@yang_stack_2017], their use in novice learning has limitations including lack of relevant, consistency, being removed from the domain context, and not being structured in a self explanatory way [@treude_understanding_2017]. While I initially encouraged participants to search within examples from the Phaser website, and authentic documentation and help forums, the resulting confusion and difficulties experienced by participants, prompted me to create other more bespoke documentation.
