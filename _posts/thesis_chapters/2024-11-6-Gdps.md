# The Use of Gameplay Design Patterns "It’s like a project in itself, really"

## Research Questions - March 2024

1. What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to participation in game coding processes?
2. How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?
3. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?


<!-- ## Notes to restructure

Really address  the community aspect of the RQ - and highlight that this is why personal elements are not explored in more detail

In each section if there are multiple aspects of that then put into headings  - and put this into the coding structure for data review

Examine overlap of the cultural uses of GDP, and the next chapter - hand in hand here get an overview of what needs to extracted from the data and where it sits

Also work out what to move to Lit Review - and restructure LT and Methodology based on two chapters near completion. -->


## Chapter outline

In the last chapter I outlined use of tools focusing on emerging tensions in activity on a micro-level. Guided by Rogoff's concept of guided participation, this chapter analyses this emergent activity at a scope between concrete tool use and the wider cultural context of the game making community. I focus on the implementation of individual game design patterns (GDPs) and in doing so addresses how data gathered informs thinking on the research question - _how can game design patterns support the development of coding practices by novices_?

This chapter begins with re-examining of game play design patterns as a unit of analysis for this research. Following this a vignette of parent child interaction in game making process helps contextualise findings. The chapter then undertakes a systematic analysis of varied uses of game design patterns by participants drawing on detailed observations of practice in recorded video data. A discussion section explores implications and observations from these findings in relation to existing research and concepts. As part of this discussion, I draw on the examples of use of game design patterns in practice to explore the analysis of GDPs as a mid-level construct, of use both to educational designers and researchers.

## On GDP as a germ-cell and unit of analysis recap of design patterns

<!-- In the introduction of this thesis, I outlined some of the broader challenges of sharing practice and research to practically support the learning of coding practices beyond the immediate context of the research in question. The choice of what scope of activity to examine in detail is relevant to this challenge.  -->

This chapter centres on an interpretation of the implementation of game design patterns (GDPs) as a unit of analysis or germ-cell of activity.  

### Recap on design patterns and game design patterns

In chapter two the use of design patterns in an education context were summarised. Design patterns provide a relatable contextual basis for learning complex code structures. More specifically, game design patterns they have been used in educational settings. In the work of Repenning and colleagues [@repenning_scalable_2015; @basawapatna_using_2010] GDPs are framed as science simulation concepts that aid transfer of concepts to similar setting. Eriksson and colleagues [-@eriksson_using_2019] draw on catalogue of GDPs can provide a useful basis for co-design work to help deepen the knowledge of participants and provide a shared language to help collaborative design.


  <!-- -  design patterns in learning design which exist at different scopes of activity [@mcandrew_patterns_2006].(CHECK THIS) -->
  <!-- - how design patterns interplay with design principles and how the process relates to design based research  [@linn_science_2006]. -->


<!-- While this concept of germ cell / unit of analysis a is more typically used in a larger scope of societal activity, the principles apply this smaller scope.  -For a study of this nature, too broad an analysis risks insufficient detail to allow replication, too narrow risks being overly context dependant and limiting the potential for wider application. -->

### Identifying GDPs as a germ cell/ unit of analysis

The last chapter explored the mutual evolution of the learning design, shaped by direct input, explicit requests and the implicit needs of the community and resulting feedback. The leading activity of iteratively of altering a game at the level of gameplay design pattern which emerged from this experimental process.  This chapter develops analysis of the role of GDPs as a guiding process for supporting resources and support processes in varied forms. These include a set of code examples, instruction tutorials, quick start activities which proposed micro level code modification.

While these approaches are  distinct in their pedagogical use, they stemmed from the same germ-cell activity of altering the game through the use of game design patterns via varied means. These include: use as part of meditational strategies by participants and facilitators and as shared objects between participants, facilitators and peers (as explored in chapter three and four).

<!-- In interpreting the results of this chapter it is of value to explore experiences of participant agency in a way which reflects the mutual development of this design. Thus the intersection of the participant agency and use of GDPs both as introduced and adopted processes will be examined in this chapter. -->



<!-- However, despite the value of a micro approach which includes close analysis of implementation of code structures. -->

<!-- The focus on GDP as unit of analysis is supported in the following observations;

- the frequency of GDP language referring to patterns used by pairs in particular in the process of collaborating on their games
- Through observation of GDPs as a germ-cell being used at different phases / scope of the learning design as it evolved.
-->

<!-- The previous chapter explores how I developed these requests into a set of code examples, instruction tutorials, quick start activities which proposed micro level code modification. While these approaches are  distinct in their pedagogical use, they stemmed from the same germ-cell activity of altering the game through transforming GDPs. -->


<!-- In addition the following aspects of the use of GDPs merit attention in this chapter:

NOTE CHECK THESE WITH THE DISCUSSION CONCLUSION.

- the value of completing something concrete a sense of sustaining achievement.
- the utility of the smaller unit of analysis in aiding resource creation / facilitation for facilitators
- any other value for practitioners, parents and young participants - i.e. in navigation and goal setting.
- the ability to reflect after implementing each sub project, -->




<!-- #### On GDPs as a concept to help analysis -->
<!-- MOVE TO METHODOLOGY - JUST GET ON WITH IT?
Blunden cites the process of identifying a germ cell of activity as a fruitful process for researchers [FIND]. In addition, Engestrom frames expansive learning as instructive for organisational change. While research is more sparse in the field of educational practice, the principles are frequently applied to classroom practice. -->
<!-- My decision to privilege the implementation of each GDP as the main objective  activity system mirrors choices by other researchers valuing  -->

<!-- CHECK AGAINST METHODOLOGY
tie in conceptts of
- leading activity
- repeated activity / iteration
- rising to the concrete - ie different forms of activity.  -->


<!-- MOVED EARLIER HERE - Check it fits? In the literature review and methodology chapter we examined different interpretations of agency used by researchers using activity theory [@hopwood_agency_2022].  -->



.

<!-- DROP? We can ask where does knowledge of GDPs in participant come from. Good games communicate their affordances, (in the form of GDPs) to the player without the need for extensive additional documentation [@gee_learning_2005]. This process also communicates GDPs implicitly to players, a process borne out by brainstorming sessions early in the process which say participants listing GDPs or variants of them without explicit guidance in this direction. This  goal setting and implementation using GDP as a base developed into a principle activity of P1 with varied results. -->

<!-- In addition to support their identification of the different elements that make up a game I created a sheet which drew on existing work framework (mechanics, space, goals, etc) to scaffold the process. -->

<!-- This study activity covers a wide spectrum of activity, in other chapters,  design stages involving discussion, planning, implementation and playtesting after each new game element. -->
<!-- THERE IS OVERLAP HERE WITH THE LAST CHAPTER - HOW TO REMOVE THAT AND RETAIN CLARITY ?

Thus in this study activity covers a full spectrum including close analysis of implementation of code structures. However these smaller operations are not worthy of being treated as an activity system in full. WHY MAKE THIS POINT. wHAT IS THE OVERALL MOTIVATION HERE?  -->

<!--
#### On GDPs as a germ concept to help practical development -->

<!-- NOTE - removed -  what is the germ cell of the overall game making activity. -->

<!-- around, game mechanics, game space, game polish and game challenges. -->

<!-- LATER?

AT provides a concept of rising to the concrete which invites analysis of how the construct of  GDPs can be be adapted to serve the development of a game making community at different scopes of activity. To illustrate this concept we can use Marx's concept of exchange as a germ-cell for analysis of capitalism.  -->
<!-- The previous chapter described the  key elements of the learning design that were in place by P2 ( remixing from a game template, use of distributed asset creation showcasing and social playtesting).  The shared tools and documentations began to shape goal setting around implementing new features, some where held in common with other groups. -->


## Study of Vignette 2

In this section, to give an overview of the specifics of the learning design, and participant interactions I use vignette to give a snapshot of the interactions of one family. This comprises a table of participant dialogue, screenshots and description of their interactions including gestures followed by a summary interpretation of interactions.

_Context:_ For the previous ten minutes the parent and child dyad have struggled a tutorial chapter in the text book  included as appendix 5.x. on adding the pattern of keys and doors ( players must collect a key and then navigate to a door to progress to the next level). The parent Suzanna has been making multiple changes to the code while the child Olivia has been expressing boredom. Suzanna suggests that Olivia asks the facilitator Mick for help to resolve the coding problem and after help has been given to solve the bug Suzanna cedes the keyboard to Olivia to test the working game.

The vignette including some gesture analysis. This is explore in more detail in a chapter on Methodolgy.

This was particularly valuable in the Key Door Person interchange where meaning was not clear before looking at video.
In previous chapter on methodology we (will) have examined the coding scheme used to code specifics on interactions and participant behaviour and output.

### Descriptive Commentary on Vignette 2

MOVE A LOT OF THIS TO THE APPENDIX - CREATE A SUMMARY HERE.

<!-- PERHAPS - REWRITE SOME OF THIS IN SANNINO TERMS OF AGENCY? -->

<!-- **Describing on a level of personal** -->

The key and door pattern is one of the harder ones to implement as it involves adding two new functions, which while simple enough, represent new code structures and thus this adds a new level of conceptual and practical complexity. The implementation of a new game design pattern (GDP) involve adding new code to the game. The amount of code and/ changes needed varied depending on its complexity. Larger changes typically need more careful manipulation of code and subsequent debugging. For this pair, these more involved coding activities were beyond the ability of the child. The parent Suzanna has taken on the role of solving harder code problems and in doing so has built important proficiency in coding practice. These include which include; finding and comprehending supporting documentation, fluidly navigating between undertaking more advanced coding to implement new GDPs, playtesting and preparing the coding environment for more basic coding of her child.


<!-- PERHAPS A SCREENSHOT OF THE TEXT BOOK - PERHAPS NAVIGATING THE DROP DOWN MENU OF PATTERNS.  -->

<!-- **Guided participation:**  -->

The parent takes action to involve her child in the design process when technical possible and to incorporate her child's interests.

THIS HAPPENS BEFORE THE VIGNETTE EXTRACT.
In the full vignette transcription included in the appendices as Vignette 2, the parent overcomes her own hesitancy regarding asking for facilitator help by sending out her child to ask. When the code problem has been solve, she signals clearly to her child to return to the design process. This indicates that she is aware of the greater possibility for effective child input at these moments. After a blockage caused by debugging coding is removed, the parent immediately re-engages the child prompting the child to play-test the game. The child is one of the younger participants when blockages occur she explores the room or to dwell on the periphery of other participants interactions.

<!-- This pair structured the process of implementing new GDPs through careful use of documentation, alternate use of keyboard, adult facilitating and coding process responsive to the child's lead, other individuals and pairs approached the same objectives in diverse ways.  -->

<!-- DIVISION ON LABOUR HERE - POSSIBLE DUPLICATE? -->

<!-- **Cultural:**  -->

The child Olivia also wants to add additional levels to their game. In recent sessions several young participants had added new levels to their games, including Toby who added over twenty. This activity had sparked much discourse between participants. It is likely that this Olivia's interest stems in part from observations of other participants games and this discourse. The child shows ongoing affective connection to the game making patterns. For example, one target game design pattern _Keys and Doors_ is repeated in a sing song voice by the child. She also chivvies the mother to get started on it (Key.)?.

There is also awareness of and playfulness surrounding the conventions of a platformer game as a dynamic system in way which drives their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game.  An understanding of the game as a dynamic system is seen clearly in the parent’s alarm when, shortly after this interaction, the child deletes all elements of hazard in one level. The parent cautions "it's no fun if their are no hazards". I interprete the response of the child -  "It is for me!" - to show her awareness of the conventions of game design and a desire to work against them. Later the child articulate her motivation to _surprise_ players with this level design.

<!-- This chapter now expands to represent this diversity of the coding and community practices of participants, focusing on their use of game design patterns. -->

<!--
MOVE TO DOL IF NEEDED

For this child developed a cyclical pattern of alternation between higher and lower engagement with the coding processes based on lower engagement the period of time when her parent was problem solving code and higher engagement once it was implemention of the structural element was almost complete. Completion of the code implementation of a GDP allows for new possibilities in design dynamics using the same text matrix level design tool.

## Observations and analysis of use of Game Design Patterns (GDPs) by participants

<!-- NOTE:  this addresses HOW THESE FINDING ARE STRUCTURED. MOVE TO INTRO? -->


The following sections focus on the way design patterns are used by parents, children and facilitators in this emerging game making community. To present findings from video data, I draw on the Rogoff's three planes of analysis [@rogoff_observing_1995] as explored in chapter 3. Acknowledging that these observation do not fall nearly into each of the three planes, I cover observation on the use of GDPs relating to, in turn, personal knowledge, interpersonal activity and finally cultural activities. The observation of these sections are also guided by concepts of the development of shared objects and meditational tools and strategies and their role in emerging community norms and practices.

<!-- Design stages (as explored in chapter two) are also used to guide categorisation , although the discussion of this chapter points to a more complex pattern of design that those outlined in many design cycles. -->

## Cultural Dimension

### Role of playtesting PLAYTESTING IN NEXT CHAPTER CAN SOME BE MOVED HERE? and feedback and GDPs


#### GDP concepts and language used in informal feedback for peers to influence modification of games


**GDPs aid the overall process of design for others by providing discreet and clear goals which are nested in the wider goal of making an engaging game.** - is this feedback cultural or guided participation - HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS EXPLORED IN NAVIGATION?

This process involves shifts in perspectives from participants as they engaging with objectives on different scopes of activity. For example, participants may get caught up in a particular design goal on a micro-level, engagement may drive an implementation of a quirky characteristic. When this game is self-tested or playtested, that characteristic may not withstand the shift in perspective to the wider goal of making an engaging game if it interferes with the engagement of the test suers.


**The concepts of game challenge and game feel evolved through informal feedback during playtesting and served to influence peers to modify their games to increase the enjoyment of peer players.**

In Chapter 5 norming behaviour was identified as an emerging characteristic of playtesting in this setting. This section shares evidence of how GDPs help this process.

The discussion of game challenge, specifically comment about how 'hard' participant games were as the most common interaction during playtesting.



The concept of difficulty for most of the participant's games was dependent on the interaction between the feel of the game controls and elements of game challenge associated with placement of hazards and moving enemies. In this design the jump mechanic is determined by the use of variables controlling gravity, jump velocity and movement velocity.

Parent Molly had been focused mostly on completing asset design. The only changes she had made to the deliberately frustrating initial player movement (discussed in design chapter) was to change player jump velocity. Player jump (y) velocity was set very high but left right (x) velocity was slow. This created a very frustrating game feel.

She had been made aware by her daughter Ne about the relevant game variables. In response, Molly asked for advice but Ne gave none walking away. Molly noted "She's left me to my own devices."

    Bertie: That looks nice (referring to the graphical look of the game)

    Molly invites Bertie to play as she can't progress due to the difficult game controls.

    Bertie: It jumps super high but so slow  
    Pause
    Molly: He has to go slow be  cause he's an astronaut, you see.    
    Bertie: It's hard.
    Bertie leaves.
    Molly: (to peer parent with serious tone.) It's hard. Wow.

    Ed comes to play the game.
    Ed: How much jump speed to you have?
    Ed: Your jump speed is massive.


Other children come and play the game but only for less than a minute before leaving. While their feedback is non verbal the very short length of time that some of them spend is noticeable.  After the last one leaves Molly comments "It's so frustrating." In interactions we can see a similar message coming from peers in the playtesting process. They praise the look of the game but offer feedback on the experience of the game mechanic of jumping. While the players do not tell Molly directly to change the game, these comments appear to direct direction of the design to comply with an emerging community norm of jump feel stemming from the personal experiences of the participants and from tangible feeling of lack of control over the player's character in the game.

This form of interaction can be analysed using the professional framework called MDA. The Mechanic dimension here is the jump game mechanic, D is the ?, and A is the frustration experienced by fellow testers. Further parallels with MDA are explored later.


<!-- We can see that Molly justifies the game feel of a very high fast jump with a narrative response about the character being spaceman. However, the limited amount of time anyone plays her game and her own frustration in playing it is telling. The game feel is frustrating in the wrong way here. Molly seems to initially misconstrue the feedback she is getting here equating her ability to make the game hard as a positive thing. However, towards the end she notes the frustrating nature of the game. -->


<!-- The same message is delivered in a variety of ways, above we can see feedback from Mick trying to bridge a technical and conversational approach, direct feedback of the personal challenge level and an interpretation of the cause from Bertie and then a more specifically technical explanation involving the naming of the variable _jump speed_. -->


<!-- The concept of difficulty for most of the participant's games was dependent on the interaction between the feel of the game controls and elements of game challenge associated with placement of hazards and moving enemies. The term _game feel_  has varied interpretation but is generally framed as the responsiveness and feeling of control over the main character during the core movement of the game. In this case, it effects the ability of players to move between platforms and avoid enemies. In this design the jump mechanic is determined by the use of variables controlling gravity, jump velocity and movement velocity. -->

<!-- The importance of these variables to is was behind the design decision to place these variable right at the top of the code and to rename them with player centric names rather than mathematical terms like velocity and acceleration.   -->

<!-- NOTE - BE SURE TO EXPLORE THIS IN SOME DETAIL IN DESIGN CHAPTER -->

<!-- The regular playtesting of games allowed participants to give each other feedback regularly and game feel was one of the aspects that young people in particular to gave frequent feedback on. -->

<!-- Parent Molly had been focused mostly on completing asset design. She had been made aware by her daughter Ne about the relevant game variables. -->


<!-- In response, Molly asked for advice but Ne gave none walking away. Molly noted "She's left me to my own devices."

Player jump (y) velocity was set very high but left right (x) velocity was slow. This created a very frustrating game feel. The following is a compilation of feedback comments or reactions over a 15 minute time period.   

    Molly:  (Talking to self) No! It's so hard that. (referring to a particular jump in her game.)
    Mick: How are you getting on Mi? It's looking good.
    Mick: (Noting frustrated air of Mi) Have you made it to hard.
    Molly:  I don't know. Can you jump from here to here with this.. this.. him? (point to main character)
    Mick: So it look like you bump your head and fall down.
    Mick: One bit of friendly feedback that I would give you is that it's taking a long time to move left and right. And that is something that you can change if you want to.
    Molly:  Oh right yeah.direct
    Mick: Yeah.
    Molly:  Yeah, actually that's a good idea.
    Mick: If you think about average games. Your average jump time would be about one second in the air. So that can be a bit of guide sometimes.   -->


<!-- As a facilitator, I shared feedback about the frustratingly slow movement time and an indirect feedback on the high velocity jump value. I use quite indirect language when giving feedback and while I reference Mi's frustration rather than giving direct feedback. -->


<!-- These norming behaviours some of the informal norming behaviours that are less directive seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues as explored in literature review [@rogoff_cultural_2003]. -->


#### The propagation of use of GDPs (through playtesting() IS IT PLAYTESTING THAT IS IMPORTANT HERE - OR THE ROLE AND NATURE OF GDPS TO AID PROPAGATION

**The implementation of particular GDPs by participant pairs or individuals often spread through peer activity.**

NOTE CAN THIS FOCUS ON NON TEMPLATED GDPs?

For example, the work of the child to add 21 levels to their own game served as a way to publicise this possibility. The process was also spread by that child's willingness to help others to add that feature to their game. This shifted dependence on myself as a facilitator, or on the instruction-based support documents. This excerpt shows this more experience child coder Toby, agreeing to show another child Bertie  how to add new levels.

    Bertie: Why’s that enemy in every level
    Toby: He’s not.
    Bertie: Can you show me how you add more levels on to yours?
    Toby: Yeah sure.
    Pause
    Toby: I’m just going to have one go of beating this (refering to his own game which he is playtesing). It’s 21 levels in it. So .. Yeeeeah.
    Pause
    Bertie: It’s like parkours in Minecraft but times. It’s like playing the game Wipeout. Have you ever played Wipeout?
    Toby: Er not really.
    Bertie: Or seen it?
    Bertie: That’s like my second level.
    Toby: Ah so hard (Tobyfails at a high level on his game and starts to move off)
    Toby: (To someone else  calling for attention)  No I’m helping Bertie.
    _(Toby then follows Bertie to his workstation to help him implement more levels.)_

When Toby moves to Bertie's game he playtests it and then looks at the code. He notes that Bertie has added a variable for a fourth level but then goes on to demonstrate to to add an array representing the next level, and a conditional statement to select level 4 when level 3 is completed. At Toby uses the keyboard completes this work, Bertie reads aloud the code which is being typed in by Toby.

Exchanges like this allow the propagation of GDPs. The process of playing a game of another and sharing your appreciation of it invites participants to add new patterns to their own game. In this example, the process is very direct with the one asking another to help them directly. It is very likely that Bertie has noticed Toby helping others add levels to their games and thus this may help him to feel empowered to do the same. Typical examples of propagating patterns include placing hazards in tricky places like a lava pit, the use of moving enemies and changes to jump dynamics.

The propagation in the example above is completed entirely through peer activity rather than instruction or supporting resources. A different pattern of propagation was that participants notice and comment on a game element or pattern during during playtesting, and then to use supporting resources or facilitator help to implement it. A less frequent pattern involved participants' diligent and deliberate use of supporting resources to identify and implement features without peer influence.

ADD IN FREQUENCY IF POSSIBLE - A ROUGH APPROXIMATION OF WORKING PATTERNS IN P2.
eg.

Analysis of the working patterns stream of the coding schema shows 4 working units relying on peer sharing, 4 on faciliator and resource help and 2 only mostly self-driven in both identification and implementation.



**New GDPs emerged from existing patterns through peer activity during playtesting**

In addition to the propagation of main game design patterns, sub patterns and related design concepts emerged organically from the community. The concept of safe zone in the game of Pearl and Clive arrived as a direct result of after adding a moving enemies GDP, the extensive use of that pattern dominates the game challenge to such an extent that it is essential for players to quickly identify and use 'safe zones'.
DEVELOP

These new patterns or elements of patterns sometime introduced new concepts and associated language into the community. When participants noticed the elements and used the relevant terminology, they are engaging in what Wegner terms legitimate peripheral participation.

While the use of some concepts can be seen as intentional affordance of the introduced design, some appear as a product of participants' funds of home knowledge. The concept of safe zone here has been transferred from the cultural experience of one participant in game playing into this community of game makers.

<!-- Playtesting also helped propogate emerging practices. For example, after testing Mi's game In the example above after comments on the jump speed Ed continues.

    Ed: How much jump speed to you have?
    Ed: Your jump speed is massive.
    Ed gives advice about tidying up the sprite outlines.
    Ed: for people with background like yours You can use the “cramping tool””
    Mark  and Ed then explain – SEE THEIR RECORDING
    So that the background is clearer.

While Ed has only just been introduced to the ability to "cramp". He is happy and able to share this useful tool with Mi. Theme -->



### The role of GDPs to facilitate learners to design for others

<!-- NOTE - ALSO LINKED TO IDEATION? - is this guided participation? -->


#### Referring to GDPs (especially during playtesting) can help scaffold the process of imagining the end user experiences.

As explored previously, playtesing as a regular practice can shift learners to a perspective of designing for others. This section examines how some GDPs  provoked participants to imagine the experience of end users of their game. Game design patterns focused on gameplay rather than code structure focus on recognisable behaviour. Thus in the same way that visually organised code can aid ideation, designing code framework to help participants alter on a noticeable change in game play can foreground key GDPs.

In the starting vignette of the chapter Olivia and Suzanna come into conflict over the imagined experience of future players. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. Suzanna shares _"Must be quite hard to get through that door._" when Suzanna places the exit door high above a platform. She then continues - _“It’s no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid.”_ The child seems determined to remove all hazards. _"It is for me!"_ the child counters. She may be aware of the implications for game balance but takes pleasure in this destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play (as explored in the previous chapter). This interaction shows the use of terms from GDPs to both explain and negotiate a conflict over the imagined user experience.

<!-- Later Olivia interacts with one of the student helpers and outlines her motivations in design.

    H1: Have you enjoyed making the game?
    Olivia: Yes
    H1- Has it been a lot of fun
    Olivia: Yes and I like making it frustrating. that other people find it frustrating!
    ...
    Olivia: You’ve nearly got to mine. Mine’s very hard to get to.
    H1. Is it?
    Olivia: You’ll like it when you get to it.
    H 1: How many levels do you have?
    Olivia: Four. Mine’s the last one. And it’s very fun. Do you want to guess about it?
    H1: Erghm. Is there lots of bikes?
    Olivia: Yes, guess how many there are?
    H1: Is it the whole screen?
    Olivia: YES! Laughs
    ...
    H1: I will get it to your level
    Olivia: You seem to not give up. that’s good
    Olivia turns away to get a hug from her mother.
    H1: I got to your level
    Olivia: Good! (laughs)
    Olivia: It’s a secret, special one. (...) If people tried hard they would get to my level. -->

Th comments that she wants players to be frustrated when playing the game and that this is a contrast to final level which has only rewards and no hazards. This being a "secret, special" experience which plays against the norms of platform game design, thus provoking player surprise and fun. She notes the persistence of the student helper who pushes past her frustration to complete the game. Suzanna remark "If people tried hard they would get to my level" shows her awareness of that not all players will persist in the same way.

<!-- #### Other examples and interpretation on designing for others / shifts of perspective

<!-- Shifts can be described as shifting between levels of activity if viewing activity through an AT lens that encompasses nested levels of activity systems. -->

<!-- There are different levels of designing for others
One is just to make a playable game experience which by design involves an imagined user experience in the abstract. The example above shows a more playful and direct imagining of the experience of other people in the room a more tangible motivation with a more immediate reward. -->

THIS SEEMS RELATIVELY WEAK AND PERHAPS A GOOD STRAND TO DROP
A common proposal of research on professional and participatory design processes is that that ideation is more productive when informed by a realistic sense of the end user experience. (explored in Lit Review) The examples show different forms of designing for others. One is to imagine a user experience and make a playable game in the abstract which matches the mother's approach. Th's playful imagining of the experience of a more immediate audience of fellow game makers and supporting students appears to provide a tangible motivation with rapid rewards.

### GDPs facilitate the use of wider funds of knowledge

**GDPs allow participants to share and explore their home and professional funds of knowledge and practices in the emerging learning community.**

These findings support existing research on FoI as an inclusive educational practice and offer a rich description of a concrete example which aims to align to inclusive, practice-based frameworks like UDL and PBL.

This process facilitated participants to bring their home and digital life interests into the game making process, a rich cultural source [Livingstone]. As outlined in literature [Gee / Ito & Scratch community] , graphical assets along with  via the use of the creation of game narratives), are motivating and sustain engagement.

The process has parallels in enthusiast communities. For example, in new grounds, itch.io, Scratch communities, and specialist game art sites, the sharing of graphic

In some of the examples above we saw Molly and Nadine showing identification with graphical making process and the process of bringing it the game.  
Beyond there internal family interaction, they share this artistic flair or attention to detail which is likely to be a part of their home funds of knowledge into the emerging learning community.
CAN THIS BE LINKED TO FORMING IDENTITY WITHING THE COMMUNITY VIA A SPECIALISM? THERE IS DATA FROM AN INTERVIEW TO SUPPORT THIS.



_Funds of knowledge from professional communities_

A potential similar specialism was evident from Dave's guidance of Toby to access professional documentation, and engage in debugging processes using the developer tools section of the web browser. (See appendix 5.x). As a facilitator, this aligned with my previous work with Mozilla web clubs. The enthusiastic sharing of for messing around with technical web tools for learning and fun.

This could have been picked up on and integrated into the design. While I did not do this, the confidence brought to the process to find resources from outside of teh walled garden of the provided resources prompted a change of game paradigm for another family who also made a top down / maze game in P3.

_Funds of knowledge from home game playing experience_

In the above example, Bertie comments on Toby's game which has a dominant game experience of timed jumping, noting "Bertie: "It’s like parkour in Minecraft but timed. It’s like playing the game Wipeout. Have you ever played Wipeout?". Parkour in Minecraft and Wipe out are both game experiences whose main gameplay mechanic is about judging jumps to landing accurately. Bertie makes links to his existing experience of games making comparisons between Toby's game, commercial games and his own. In doing so Bertie is able to show his knowledge and analysis of gameplay patterns to this community. While his motivation is not clear, one interpretation is that Bertie could be making this contribution not only to openly share experience but also as a offering in return for his request for help which he has just made.

## GDPs used in the process of guided participation

This section explores data on the use of GDP from the perspective of interpersonal interaction the process of being guided into planned activity or peer work which is exploratory but helps developing of interpersonal processes which serve the completion of the activity. From observations of video data, I observe how GDPs are used in diverse  meditational strategies by different participants.

### GDPs offer the potential to assist project navigation, acting as a framework for code examples and step-by-step tutorials

<!-- DRAW ON CHAPTER 4 MUTUAL EVOLUTION - AND FIND EXAMPLES . -->

**The use of a catalogue of design patterns addresses a tension of participants choice and the need for documentation to support the technical implementation of code structures. However, not all participants used provided instructions and develop diverse ways to implement patterns.**

<!-- - RECAP DOCUMENTATION TENSIONS HERE WITH FOCUS ON AGENCY
- ALSO FOCUS ON MY ROLE AS A DESIGNER INTRODUCING DOCUMENTATION AND STRATEGIES (PERHAPS MAPS TOO IN LINE WITH 5TH D) -->

The tension between of participant choice and use and providing appropriate scaffolding materials to support implementation of code was explored in the previous chapter. The decision to base supporting resources around a menu of game design patterns was an end product of a mutual evolution.

The vignette in this chapter shows the parent following the child's desire to implement a GDP using a step by step tutorial. The vignette of the chapter four showed Toby copying a code example which he chose from a graphical menu of patterns. The previous chapter also outlined the use of starting activities which selected key changes to code or simplified design processes designed to maximise personalisation and changes to the starting game template. These varied forms of scaffolding represent different approaches to supporting the process of making alterations to the code inline with a use-modify-create (UMC) approach.

NOTE ARE DIFFERENT APPROACHES BEST EXPLORED HERE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE?


NOTE -
While GDPs emerged as a natural response fr the participants when requesting onding help, it is important to note that from P2 onwards, because the learning resources I created were themed on GDPs, it follows that many request for help would be oriented around this framework.
Thus the following observations bear this caveat but still show potential.

DATA CALL HERE - Examples from the data of participants using GDPs as a framework for organisation and project navigations.





dOES THIS FIT HERE? In addition to use of printed or online resources, this chapter will explore how varied forms of help between peer participants also became important process of the game making community from early stages.  Later sections explore varied strategies used to implement GDPs including, informal propagation of GDPs as a result of playtesting, the development of specialists division of labour and

However, despite this variety, this chapter will explore how the evolving collection of GDPs acted as a base for the variety of approaches that emerged from it. To do this, the following sections explore different uses of game design patterns.


Key characteristics of structuring support around quick start activities and a subsequent menu of GDPs which align with existing research include:

- supporting the value of informal approaches to learning technology [ITO etc] whilst avoiding the lack of support in P1 where participants called out for more support with technical and organisational processes.
- providing shorter, just-in-time tutorials
to reduce barriers associated with more extensive instruction-based approaches including barriers of literacy [@dietz_design_2021; @resnick_coding_2020].


<!--
At this phase of research documentation included; comment help within the game template; a step-by-step tutorial which build up the code of the starting template and explore the computing concepts, a menu of self-contained code examples of game elements game elements or game design patterns (GDPs); supporting tutorials briefly explaining how to add the new code needed to implement the patterns. -->



<!-- In addition, Direct help between peer participants, as outlined other section, was a key process of the game making community from early stages.
However, to overcome scarcity of facilitator support, direct help processes were seeded by other forms of support resources and written documentation. -->


<!-- #### Use of simple code examples which demonstrate the pattern in isolation -->
<!--NOTE DEVELOP THIS EXAMPLE - RELATE TO PRACTICE OF CODE PATCHING (EXPLORED IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER) -->
<!-- Code examples were initially the starting resource. The idea being it was quick to see the behaviour in context. The, use of code examples by Toby in 2019-05-08 shows the effectiveness of the use of code examples by participants.  -->


<!-- The timings of the process of patching the code show that the learner is hesitant in the process. He checks the code and then checks the game output to test that the code creates the desired behaviour. Once this is verified he progresses to copy and paste the code from the create function of the sample code to the create function of his own source code. -->


<!-- NOTE - PERHAPS INTEGRATE PART OF THE CODE PATCHING PROCESS FOR THIS SECTION -->

<!-- Towards the end of phase 1 I began to create code examples to illustrate of how particular commonly requested game features were implemented. These barebone game projects were hosted on a code playground. An online document in our shared google drive working space linked to these examples. I would help participants access this when they requested a certain feature. This list of game features began to grow. For phase one these code example were not particularly successful at increasing learner independence. There were differences in the code structure of their games and the examples and translation was not intuitive. -->



<!-- NOTE REMOVED
This section prioritises describing the code patching process using examples and guided instructions rather than the first principles.   -->


### GDPs used to scaffold ideation processes

**GDPs are used in a variety of ways to guide the ideation process via restriction of choice in pattern collection, starting template includes core dynamics, visual code structures of GDPs suit rapid prototyping.**

The design chapter explored the tension between reduced choice of genre of game. In my journal notes and observations of the games created, I note that the provision of a graphical menu of GDPs significantly decreased in time spend in ideation phase by providing scaffolding and a restriction of choice. Analysis of participant use of the menu as detailed in the documentation section above Toby supports this analysis. Other techniques that leveraged the characteristics of game design patterns to support the ideation process emerged in community design activities.

<!-- The reduction on the length of the course was welcome show by Ma's comment. "It did go on for too long." -->


#### Knowledge of game design patterns used to stimulate and communicate new ideas

In the following example home-base knowledge is utilised to help shape new design ideas and problem solving practices. Dave and Toby are working closely as a pair.  The following interaction shows a rich interchange where the parent is trying to draw on the game playing experiences to promote innovation in the design of the existing template.


<!-- THIS IS STRONGLY LINKED WITH IDEATION - PERHAPS MOVE THERE. -->

    Dave: Have you thought about pushing it a bit further and have a different style of game?
    Toby: What do you mean?
    Dave: Well the previous style of game was a platform (makes shape with hands) game wasn’t it? You went along and there was gravity pushing down (points down). There are other types of games aren’t there?
    Toby: Pause. I don’t know what to do thought.
    Dave: Well quite but what other games are there? again

Dave invites thinking outside of the constraints of the suggested design early in this first session. In this example the family bring their knowledge of game play patterns and genre conventions and more broadly experience and a perspective of coding as a creative challenge to the activity.

<!--
The following exchange shows how the use of GDPs help participants navigate the professional practice of forking a codebase and the exploration of developer resources. Technically, he has the courage to divert from the existing game paradigm from platform to maze. Practically it brings up issues as many of the dominant game design patterns are different. Thus the first one they identify that of enemy following is not present in the current menu of choices.

THIS IS  LINKED WITH discuSSION - PERHAPS MOVE THERE.



Toby adopts with this suggestion readily once he understands Da's suggestion. He then approaches Mick with a suggestion.

    Toby: You could have a game where every 15 seconds 10 seconds you could add and enemy to such and such a random number between such and such (holds up hands to indicate parameters). You could block it somewhere.
    Dave: So instead of.. instead of the world… the world being sideways. We could have the world being looked down on. (reindicates the change of perspective)
    Toby: Hmm. How should I do this then?
    Dave: That’s a good question. Shall we ask Mick to see if that would mess things up or not?
    Toby: Mick
    Mick: Hi ya.
    Toby: Erm. Thinking about what game to do . I was thinking can we make like a Pac-man game kind of thing (indicates movement of character with hands)
    Dave: If we had an on the top game rather than a platform game
    Mick: I think it could work. You could kind of adapt that game by, kind of, removing gravity.
    Dave: and see what happens?
    Mick: and see what happens.


LOA FROM COMPUTING PEDAGOGY RELEVANT HERE - WHERE ELSE ARE THEY EXPLORED?

Dave  expresses his desire to for the pair to try something new by implementing a pattern not in the menu of GDPs provided. Their new choice is a change of perspective which involves a new game pattern of a new movement game mechanic. The specific proposal is to remove a jumping game mechanic and using a 2D top down movement mechanic used in maze and adventure games (e.g. Pac-man and Zelda games).

Toby takes on the role of checking these change of direction with me. He uses a concrete example of a game to indicate the shift of genre and games space structure implied, saying "I was thinking can we make like a pacman game kind of thing". Dave  is more explicit naming the shift of perspective and genre. Mick takes this to a concrete code level by making reference to a key change of code that would be involved.

The decision to divert from the existing meny of GDPs and genre can be triangulated with interview data from Dave  on the motivation behind his involvement in volunteering at Coder Dojos.

PERHAPS DROP THIS QUOTE OR WORK OUT HOW TO BETTER INTEGRATE IT?

    Honestly, it's just it's just my hobby and I love it is the main reason. In fact, it's probably the only reason. If I can, if I can persuade / cajole / trick my kids into being involved at the same time, then that's even better. Personally, I think that's about it. I've always been interested in computers. I love, I love, I love programming. I'm no good at pencils and pens drawing or anything like that. But writing software is the closest I get to a creative outlet. So I just love doing that.

Given this additional perspective, I interpret Da's influence to divert as a way of embracing a creative challenge and bringing his child along for the ride. However, Dave  is also aware of potential challenges of straying too far from the template. He does not want to "mess things up".

A BIT ON FORKING ISSUES - TO EXPLORE LATER MOVE BELOW TO DISCUSSION?

This tension has a parallel to a professional practice of "forking" code-bases in open-source code communities. The practice of forking can involve taking a code base in a new direction and the benefits of adaption may be out-weighed by disadvantages including the friction involved in splitting an existing community and duplication of effort. The parent checking with a Mick a guiding community member about the advantages and disadvantages of a major fork in the code structure mirrors this professional tension.

This example shows that while the use of GDP can help support choices within a frame, there is also the ability to break out of that restriction and keep some of the benefits of the shared code base.

My own positive response to their suggestion was driven partly from knowledge of Da's cultural background a both a professional coding and a volunteer supporting children's coding programmes. While simultaneously checking with other groups that they use the starting template as a base, to avoid overload as previously discussed in design decisions, I encourage this pair to see what happens as a potential learning opportunity. I am conscious that the change of movement may open up different possibilities for new game patterns that this pair may be able to solve. This outweighs the possibility that the pair will get bogged down in complex code problems or structures which may be beyond the capacity of the young person. After all even if they encounter father must solve, the apprentice does not need to understand everything in order to benefit from observing the master at work.

#### The use of GDPs to encourage intuitive and visual prototyping

<!-- NOTE - PERHAPS MOVE THIS TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER / METHODS? NOT GDP SPECIFIC? OR PART OF STARTING DESIGN -->

**Some GDPs allow the spacial exploration of design in a visual way that suits being mapped onto paper, or onto graphical software which allows for a similarly intuitive and rapid prototyping.**

The use of paper prototypes was one technique used by several parents to support their children to form and develop their design ideas. In our starting vignette the matrix helped the child design with little coding or literacy ability.

Later in their interactions the parent notices the child's difficulty in using cursor and delete/backspace keys to edit a matrix allowing level design. The parent provides a book with grid paper to allow the child to replicate the matrix. The parent is then able to transcribe the design to the code example while engaging the child by checking she has interpreted the design correctly.

![](./Pictures/vign_a_1.png)
![Graphical representation of code]({{ site.baseurl }}/Pictures/vign_a_1.png)

The way the code is structured has been chosen to allow a graphical analogue between the lines of code in the form of a comma separated array and the appearance of the resulting game output on the screen. The parent uses the graphical representation of design in the code template as a jumping off point to make a connection to home practice of sketching things out in paper. The process of turn the sketched into reality on the screen and sharing with others appears to be transformative in terms of the engagement level of the child.



<!-- NOTE - RETURN TO THIS IN ANALYSIS OF TADS - -->
<!-- - in planning stages the parent provides scaffolding to help the child.
When GDP was completed and participant or pair move to a new phase there is evidence of a reenergising effect.
More on role of parent and child to negotiate approaches which maximise engagement / progress / keep flow .
Somethinkg about more direct link between code and output. - as with block coding - this is an intermediate step.
-->

<!-- There are other examples of the use of paper prototyping of GDPs being used by parents to provide scaffolding for their children. When invited to share about their design process in a post session interview, Ed and Mark  also discuss the use of paper to clarify initial GDP ideas in interview data. When asked if they were able to Mark  prompts

    Mick: Tell me a  bit  how you came up with those aims in your game, in terms of coming up with a plan.
    Mark: What for the things that we need to do to it to finish it?
    Mick: Yeah. Oh, just even from the beginning point. How did you plan together as well?
    Mark: Well we started off on paper didn’t we. That's the first thing we did. I think it was a benefit actually. We, we did a lot of sketching didn’t we and a lot of brainstorming ideas and seeing and trying to test out whether it would work.

Later in the interaction, the parent outlines a different use of prototyping, that of sketching directly into software. For this pair, the child appears to prefer sketching directly into software. The father also appreciates potential problems of translating ideas from paper into a digital format.

    Mark: I was very excited by seeing Ed playing with this because it's interesting that everything doesn't have to be a paper and pen.
    It's nice to just for the kids to feel that they can sketch on Piskel straight off the bat without taking a tutorial or being told by an adult.  It's really intuitive and you just go straight into it.
    Mick: That's an interesting thing because in some ways it started off with people working on paper because I thought that would be really accessible. Yeah. And maybe it was through observations of people just going “Do you know what I’m just happy sketching on Piskel”.
    Mark: (Animatedly) The kids, all the kids I saw not just Ed.
    Mick: Digital sketching.
    Mark: Yeah.
    Mick: It seemed to have value in that you were just doing it in the same format that you would use for the game.

    Mark:   Yeah. I think it's really important. I think the pencil and pen thing just didn't work did it. We sketched... It's got its place. But it's, the kids weren't that interested in using the graph paper to block out Piskel. It didn't translate. It was just easier to block it out straight in software. -->

One pair's ideation helped by the use of a GDPs is the following example which shows Toby and Dave  are creating a new tilemap for a maze game. Toby is able to map existing knowledge of tools and home knowledge of the kid of game he is imagining to rapidly make revisions.

    Toby: Oo. Shall we try to make it (unintelligible). Cos in pac man you can go off the edge.
    Dave: and you wrap round the other way?
    Dave: Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Save that for version 1.1
    Toby continues making changes to the code design.
    Dave: What’s the theme? What are you drawing?
    Toby: What? I’m trying to make like a pac-man type thing.
    Dave: Alright. What if you sketched it on paper first? Or have you got it in your head?
    Toby: I’m just kinda going for it it. (laughs)
    Dave: Ok go for it, see what you get up to.
    Toby: I’ll leave a hole there.

As aligned with the learning design principle of rapid feedback, changes in the code which Toby is altering to impact on the new design pattern of a top down game, are immediately apparent in the preview window. As such, Toby does not feel the need to prototype on paper.

NOTE - ADD IN A SUMMARY OF THE POST INTERVIEW DATA from Mark and Ed TO UNDERLINE THIS POINT.



**Other examples of GPDs helping the ideation process**

NOTE - TO DEVELOP AFTER MORE ANALYSIS OF VIDEO DATA.

The use of GDPs to scaffold the ideation process was a common pattern used by X of the Y sessions analysed.



#### GDPs as used by participants in their prioritisation in the ideation process

**GDPs are mentioned by name and via verbal and physical descriptions as a lingua franca and as shortcuts by participants when prioritising work**

<!-- informal task division -->
The following exchange between participants Ed and Mark  shows GDPs being used to try to organise future activity.
<!-- Online version as table - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLx8j9djYqJdZHwKJ09mmIDMYO7YqlMDhuHx2hiqpJI/edit -->

At this stage of their process, some of these patterns have been discussed and sketched out some started but only partially completed. For example, the child has designed different frames of animation but this has not been exported to the right format or implemented in code form. This interchange shows a tension between a more chaotic style of working jumping from one goal to another and a parental motivation to prioritise one work to be done. This tension is outlined when a parent Mark gives an update on progress. "So, we’ve made quite a lot of progress this week. I think the issue we’re having is that Fi’s super excited so we’re kind of jumping from one thing to another and that’s kinda overwhelming me a bit." An earlier interaction illustrates this dynamic clearly.

    Mark: I’ve brought the music, and also we could just concentrate on one thing and just change that. You know, keep working through.
    Ed: Yeah. I think I want to get an enemy in - oh no - my person animated.
    Mark: So you want to get your person animated that’s the main thing.
    Mark: Shall we concentrate on that and changing the platforms into something different?
<!-- Ed: Yeah.
Mark: Yeah?
Ed: I also want to make a theme tune.
Mark: Yeah. It’s, that’s what I mean, you can’t just skip around like that.
Ed: Hmmm.
Mark: Just cos it gets really overwhelming.
Mark: Yeah..? So…?
Long pause.
Mark: Well I’ll have a look at the code and see if I can make sense of that. -->

The child's initial listing of features is a brainstorming technique. Such techniques are used to aid a creative process. This example shows the use of the approximate names of a number of game design patterns by the child adult. These are _get the person animated_, _get an enemy in_, _changing the platforms into something different_, _make a theme tune_. However while this use of terms shows the promise of the use use of GDPs as conceptual short cuts to aid planning and  prioritisation, the process is still not unproblematic. The parent seems to lack a process to map these out and then to work together to prioritise them.  Instead he appears to be keen to quickly pick one.  His suggested process is to then work through the documentation on that pattern. Ed appears reluctant to both work on adapt a the working process suggested by his father. Hence, the next section continues to explore this interaction in an exploration of the division of labour between participants.


<!-- Patterns and the multiple actions and operations they entail are referred to briefly using short cut names.   -->


<!-- Discussion later or before??? Maps -
GDP are already being used as a way to set goals, track progress and prioritise but the process seems stressful or unsatisfactory. Some kind of support help scaffold this process would be potentially productive. Changes to the emerging 3M design to provide such support are explored in the following chapter. -->


<!--
We can compare this drawn out process with a more rapid prioritisation guided by a parent with more experience in software development. Toby and Dave  are discussing possible features early in the process if ideation.

They thinking of a feature – wrap around like Pac-man
Dave  – Yeah we can do that. Save that for version 1.1
-->

<!-- This pattern completion is mirrored in the work of other pairs. Thus replicating is a kind of participation in an emerging community.
There is also a link made by the parent to previous working practices. Using a paper book to make a sketch of the work to be completed. -->
<!-- These kinds of shifts of activity and cultural practices brought by the participants also feed into the ongoing culture of the game making community. For example the use of paper designs and paper prototyping that for some of the home ed families was a familiar practice was something that I adopted more broadly after observing the families involved. -->

<!--
NOTE - IS THIS ALREADY COVERED IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER - COMPLEX DESIGN PROCESSES? ()

- Well suited to build a repeated design practice.
- Especially with starting documents,
- Small changes had big effects.
- Variable changes needed immediate testing.

While the design suits repeated design practice as illustrated by the example above, not all pairs or individuals interacted with GDP in such a neat way.

A later discussion section in this chapter illustrates a more complex interaction with design stages. -->



### GDPs aiding the process of division of labour

<!-- NOTE - DIVISION OF LABOUR IS IN THE NEXT CHAPTER TOO - REWRITE BASED ON GDP ONLY CONTENT
CHECK FOR OVERLAP-->

**Participants worked mostly as pairs or individuals, alternating between community playtesting and pair/individual design work. Participants split work between them and resolve problems. GDPs feature in processes of division of labour in a variety of ways.**


#### Working knowledge of different types of GDPs can help participants to divide project elements by pattern

The implementation of some GDP involved the use of different tools and activities. As learners build the familiarity with the component actions needed to implement design patterns, some start to specialise as they divide labour between pairs or peers.

In the last section, Mark and Ed used GDPs to attempt to prioritise work. However, following this Mark is engaged puzzling over documentation on how to add animation to a character for some time. This results in Ed being blocked from progressing. In the next exchange, they progress to more successfully divide their labour informally.

    Mark: Quite complicated. But we can do it. But it would mean a lot of mucking around
    Ed: Ah Er
    Mark: Which is difficult to do while we’re here. But it’s doable.
    Mark: It’s like a project in itself really.
    Ed: Project in itself?
    Mark: Yeah! (laughing). I just want to know like. We can get him in. So if I ask about the sizing.
    Ed: Hmmn
    Mark: I think you can edit the size here.
    Ed: Why don’t you go here for a computer and you can do that?
    Mark: Why. What. While you’re doing what?
    Ed: Um making a sound track or something. I could do something like that.
    Mark: Ok. Yeah. I’ll see if there’s any more computers in the cupboard.

<!--
THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT
Or perhaps the parent steers the child into graphical areas as they are able to continue without stressing out the parent. Thus the child's
compliance may be a kind or pragmatic decision to allow smoother progress. -->

The father describes previous behaviour which showed issues involving
prioritisation as 'skipping around like that' or 'jumping all over the place' as 'overwhelming'. The child does not respond to this suggestion to focus on one GDP, suggests a different option. He suggests splitting and using one laptop each. He names one of the other pattern. The child continues to work on parallel patterns or component actions of pattern using tools and processes which he is more familiar with. This child also begins researching other toolsets, in this session, research to identify an online tool to create an short audio soundtrack. This serves the child as it allows them to avoid waiting for their father and moving different parts of the overall project forward.

The familiarity with GDPs facilitates  the young person to direct an informal division on labour. (HOW EXACTLY?)
The child appears to make a tactical decision allowing the father to specialise in GDPs that involve deciphering technical instructions, whilst he engages with a pattern that involves creating assets in non-code / GUI environments.

#### Structuring work processes through implementing modular sub-projects in the form of GDPs can aid division of labour

Structuring code implementation on relatively small code stages of GDP implementation steers the production process towards relatively frequent iterations of design cycle. Specifically the design stages here typically involve; ideation, planning, implementation, testing and modification and sharing via playtesting.

Sh and Olivia relied on the parent to do the majority of code implementation and shared one computer. The opening vignette shows the child use the name of a GDP as a way to communicate about the shared work of making a game.

     Olivia: Go on then. Key - Door - Person.
     Suzanna: Person?
     Olivia: Key Door Person.
     Olivia gestures with her hands to indicate that her mother is the person she is referring to.

The utterance by the child "Key Door Person"  work on the game design pattern called Keys and Doors to the adult. The child appears to consider the level of complexity needed to add a new pattern into the code to be beyond her ability and thus directly delegate the task to her mother. Feedback from the parent indicated that this division of labour was partly due to reading ability.

    "Olivia got on better during the coding once the student who was hovering initially left us alone. Because every time Olivia hesitated, she jumped in to do it for her. Whereas I know her better so can judge how to facilitate more minimally, and I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles.  Plus she can't read yet, so she was recognising the relevant bits of code by matching the individual letters, which takes longer."

The parent outlines her strategies used to address lack of reading ability as a barrier to participation. The design choice of a grid of letters representing different elements of the platform game appears appropriate in the case of a novice learning to code and read at the same time.  After the child has delegated a coding task to her mother she undertakes other activities. At times her activities directly contribute to the main goal of game making. At times the parent asked the child to seek help from facilitator. On another occasion when the child appeared bored of waiting for parent to solve a code problem, she approached the facilitator to ask for help on behalf of the adult without prompting. At other times she engages more peripheral activities such as watching older children playtest each others games, or observing community activity from under the table.


Analysis of video data uncovered flexible way in which the participant divided the process of game making. While these processes were emergent in that they were not in by the facilitator, they show traces of home collaboration practices. For example, Suzanna and Olivia alternated between use of keyboard and mouse to give the child hands on experience when possible. In interview data the parent note "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." The parent driving seat to overcome code blockages then allowed the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.


#### Other notable observations concerning division of labour in the video data

While these following observations are more generally inked to the overall design process rather than the specific note they are of value to RQ2 on developing agency.

While Olivia's activity away from the screen and the main objective of coding and creating assets for their game could in a conventional educational model be seen an non-productive, in a community model of learning this can be interpreted differently. For example as legitimate peripheral activity [@lave_situating_1991], or as an observation stage of LOPI model [@rogoff_learning_2014].  The possibility for children to not engage in community activities is seen by Rogoff [-@rogoff_cultural_2003; -@rogoff_organization_2016] as an important characteristics in participation based models of learning.

These examples illustrate the varied strategies to  divisions of labour that parents and children adopt. While  seem beneficial for many participants however complex tensions in activity emerge. For example  Molly and Nadine reversed traditional helping relationship, and the child would reluctantly implement the parent's requested technical elements of GDPS but would pointedly not explain the changes made, seemingly taking pride in knowing something that her mother didn't.

<!-- NOTE - COVERT TO TABLE?

Molly continues to do solo design using the Piskel graphical too. She encounters a design problem. When erasing a part of the design she gets rid of background colour. Molly asks for help from partner but receives misleading advice which does not help her progress.
Molly:  Oh no it’s not done that has it?

Molly calls the name of her child across room with theatrical gesture and loud whisper voice
Molly: “Nadine !”
Molly then makes face, wiggles head and shrugs at parent peer. The other parent laughs.
Nadine arrives to help. -->


    Molly: I’m trying to delete them but they turn light grey.
    Nadine : So you want to get rid of them?
    Molly: What are you doing? You have to tell me what you are doing so I can do it myself.
    Molly: laughs
    Nadine : laughs.
    Molly: I’ll just have to keep shouting at you if you don’t tell me.
    Molly - How did you do that so quickly? I’ve got to like, carefully... (makes hand gestures to show a sense of hesitant keyboard use)
    Parent peer laughs
    Nadine bounces up in place and smiles broadly.

<!-- Nadine uses the mouse to select the grey background colour with the colour picker tool, then the pen tool to fill in gaps in the design. She then swaps the active colour back from grey to black by clicking the option to swap foreground and background colours.
Molly - How did you do that so quickly? I’ve got to like, carefully... (makes hand gestures to show a sense of hesitant keyboard use)
Parent peer laughs
Nadine bounces up in place and smiles broadly.
Molly: Thanks
Molly: So am I like back with the black now?
Nadine : Yeah but if you want to delete it just press X (which switches between foreground and background colours) and then do it.
Molly: Oh X. Alright Bubs. Thanks. -->


    <!-- NOTE - this is a secondary examples - where GDPs as a concept are not vital. -->

Here the child has a powerful position and seems to enjoy this. In contrast the parent explains her frustration but does this light heartedly.

In terms of division of labour, the interaction here is complex.
Both the parent and child here takes great pride in the graphical work of game making. The parent shows this after being complemented by a fellow parent on graphical design saying "Thank you I'm very proud".

This allows them a level of participation which is helpful without being stuck on more tricky technical or code related problems.

The child also specialises in this aspect spending much time on this aspect. This interaction show her demonstrating to her mother on request proficiency in tool use, another example shows this in asset migration.


This example shows  a practical division of labour based on the building of emerging skills and technical processes. The learning design which prioritises choice of different GDPs facilitates this. The process here illuminate the process of  building an identity as an individual or a family is. The next section develops this theme.


Toby and Dan's pair process of accessing professional documentation also illustrated an aspect of their family learning culture. The pair's process is more guided and focused than many other participants. In several interchanges the father starts as a facilitator taking a lead from the direction of the child. As the child reaches the limits of their ability he begins to be more directive, by asking leading questions and testing existing knowledge. Finally, in order to complete the programming or research tasks beyond of the child's knowledge, the father is more direct in instruction, directing the research and proposing a coding solution for their new game design pattern.

This approach appears to be influenced by Dan's experience as a software engineer and volunteer at Coder Dojo (Glossary). Interview extracts (included as appendices) show a direction to support the novices direction as a facilitator where possible.

    I try never to touch the keyboard of who's there. If they are stuck on something I always tell them what to do. Even if it's then taken me five minutes to explain what a semicolon is. And point. It's that key. Because it was just, I could do it so effortlessly. I think I'm sure I put people off very quickly by "Dave did something really quickly. I don't know what it was.".

This extract from interview data indicates a priority to support the learner to develop independently but to still be very present in the support process.

**Leveraging the possibilities of emerging divisions of labour:**  While the context of the participants as families involved in home education makes any general claims difficult, these observations support  exist in other research in this domain. For example, research shows that children have the potential to help parents as technology brokers [@correa_brokering_2015]. In joint technology work parents can fulfil several,reciprocal roles including, collaborator, resource provider, learner, non-technical consultant and emotional support [@barron_parents_2009].

Thus, in response to the creative support that parents and siblings provide, facilitators should design learning environments to facilitate these possibilities. The work of Roque provides guidance for helpers in the process to support parents to value and feel confident these roles [@roque_im_2016] in a way which mirrors the use of helpers this phase of my study.





<!-- NOTE - DIVISION OF LABOUR IS IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER TOO - REWRITE BASED ON GDP ONLY CONThTENT -->


<!-- The parent cedes the keyboard and mouse and sometimes swaps chairs to allow child to play test the game created.  -->




<!-- At one point the testing process Suzanna shows frustration as gravity value is very low making any movement very slow with little control. While the child has previously rejected increasing the value, the parent's initial acceptance of this decision is later questioned.

<!--
NOTE - MOVE TO LATER CHAPTER AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF FLEXIBLE DESIGN?

 While the father was keen to prioritise and then complete one pattern, the child takes a more piecemeal approach. Later in the session the father then gets drawn into creating audio assets after observing his son searching for suitable tools. The father becomes distracted from his stated task as he is responsive to help the child when they get stuck on an alternative pathway they have chosen to avoid waiting on the parent. While this may be stressful for the parent, lots of progress in the overall game project can be observed in any particular session and the child seems to be developing useful skills managing the parent. -->
 <!-- both with the familiar graphical asset tool Piskel and exploring new territory by researching an seeking a new tool for creating audio assets, specifically a background theme tune . -->

 <!-- While there was no formal organising of groups in phase 2 and 3, the family bonds between parents and children created similar patterns of seeking validation, sharing planning. Although this was more the case for dyads working side-by-side on the same game, similar patterns existed for other configurations. -->

<!-- MORE EXAMPLES  ? -->
<!--
NOTE - check if this fits
Once the code for the new game mechanic has been added, the child is guided to take on challenge of making smaller changes that give rapid feedback.  To aid the process the parent navigates to a particular part of the code for child to alter design. The changes the child makes have a large impact on the end users experience.
 -->

### The role of GDP used in emerging technical processes

<!-- tool use, technical processes and specialist language -->

The emergence, use and propagation of new technical processes motivated by a drive to implement or complete a GDP often happen informally between peers.

The processes are not static but are modified by the community as they are adopted and passed on. Some processes are introduced in a basic form through scaffolded activities like those provoked by the quick start cards. For some groups, they were introduced explicitly as a parent explains, facilitates or guides a process or at times technical processes are passed on informally in more casual help interactions as illustrated in the previous example.


<!-- Taking a more focused view of the activity here would be implementing a game design pattern - e.g. adding keys and doors pattern in this case. On the level of action, creating a graphical asset of a key and adding this to the level design. The operation would be the exporting the graphical asset as a suitable file format from graphical design tool and uploading it to the code authoring tool. -->

#### Use of GDPs to facilitate use of tools

In this interaction above which was used to illustrate Molly and Nadine's division of labour, the parent is focused on completing the action of creating a graphical asset of a hazard as part of the activity of adding the GDP of including a hazard into the game. Nadine appears reluctant to help at first and when she does she is mostly non-verbal and makes changes quickly in a way that her mother cannot initially follow or replicate. The process of explaining this to her parent would be more time consuming. There may also be a power dynamic happening as well with the child enjoying showing proficiency without sharing the process perhaps as a performative
demonstration agency or growing status within this community.

THERE IS CROSS OVER HERE WITH CHAPTER 4 - ACTION TO OPERATION - WHAT DOES THIS ADD? HOW TO COMPRESS IT?

We can see that the process of changing pen colours on the graphical tool is one which the child has been able to translate into a effortless process whereas the parent is still consciously building her competency. Nadine has operationalised the process and it becomes part of the toolset of practices that she can draw on [CITE]. Molly also benefits, the expertise of her child to undertake that process is added to her distributed toolset. However, she is also keen to develop her own competency as indicated by her asking child to explain the process.

#### Diverse use of technical processes driven by GDPs
MOVED SO EDIT DOWN  
References to such emerging practices driven by GDPs were present in many exchanges during directed playtesting and pair interactions.

Other examples of processes being adopted by participants through the implementation of GDPs including the fluidity of navigation between playing and coding window shown by all younger participants and many adults and the development of keyboard and mouse coordination to facilitate navigation within the code environment and external support resources to facilitate the code patching process.

In describing this research it is important to avoid overreach when describing the possible utility of GDPs by making a distinction between primary and secondary involvement of GDPS in technical processes.

Some examples contain processes that are linked to the language and the concepts and player experience of GDPs, for example the use of GDP language of hazards and rewards (see extract).

Other examples are more secondary where the emerging processes and adoption of language concern more to do with more general digital design,  which are needed due to the process of implementing game features - which are in this case structured via GDPs.

Thus while the concepts of GDPs are some times useful to explain a technical concepts directly, especially where direct / immediate feedback involving concrete example of experience are relevant, at times the process in more indirect.

After giving feedback on the jump speed Molly's game Ed sharing a process to redundant space at the edges of design sprite characters.

The following example for the most part covers a the technical process of removing redundant space from around art in graphical editors. However the process becomes much clearer to Molly when linked directly to here experience of a game design pattern of altering the sprites hit box.

<!-- NOTE - COVERT TO TABLE? -->

    Ed: for people with background like yours You can use the cramping tool.
    Ed leads Molly to his workstation and involves his father in the process.
    ...
    Mark: In Piskel. You can crop it to the sprite  - cause it take that area too. (gestures – draws a large square with hands – then gestures to the edges). You approach an enemy if you’re close to it, it’ll trigger it.
    Molly: ‘cause, sometimes you think how am I just sitting on this ledge here?
    Mark: And you’re floating?
    Molly: Yeah. Yeah that’s what’s happening. So..
    Mark: So you can put your sprite back in again and you can crop it down.

<!-- Mark: Show what? What are we doing?
Ed: On this one it’s like this.
Molly: Oh that’s good how did you do that?
Ed: The cramping tool. (laughs nervously)
Mark: The what?
Ed: What… Is it cramping? (gestures with hands as scrunching / clutching motion)
Mark: For doing what? What did we do? I don’t know what we’ve done.
Ed: People have used the whole block.
Mark: Oh yeah. We’ve just cropped it. So it’s got no border around it. So you don’t set things off when you get really close to them.
Molly: Aaaah. I see yes. Cos the corners actually could have. (makes a small square gesture with fingers)
 -->




#### Use of GDPs in the development of shared language

**Language which has been introduced facilitator interventions is then modified and used organically through community interaction.**

The following example shows a patchy but evolving use of some of the terminology that has been introduced partly by facilitator interventions and partly emerging organically through community interaction. As the community adopt the practices the become community norms.

As background information on this pair, the mother's focus has been on creating graphics and has expressed pride in this her growing expertise in this area.

The mother wants to export an image from the graphical editing tool and to import this into the game.

    Molly: Right so I don't want this rocket here. I want the rocket to be the yellow thingie.
    Nadine – Gold coins.
    Molly - Right so, What are you doing? Do you know what you are doing?
    I want the aliens to be the hazard, the rockets to be the gold coins and the spaceman to be the character.
    Molly: Poop Ping? (alarmed) What are you doing? What's poop ping.
    Where's my spaceman?
    Nadine : Wait! What do you want the aliens as?
    Molly: The hazards.
    Molly: Yaaay!
    Molly: And now the rocket thing as the like you know the good thing - the reward.
    Nadine : Who wants a rocket for their reward?
    Molly: Because if a spaceman gets to a rocket he can get home. But if he doesn't then the aliens get him.
    Nadine : It's a very violent game.
    Molly: What?
    Nadine : It's a very violent game.

The mother develops her proficiency of expressing GDP related concepts and language as this interaction develops. This may be to show her increased level of understanding and participation on overall process after being challenged by daughter about her use of technical language. "Do you even know what export means?". Nadine also appears to enjoy using the language and norms of game culture to tease her mother. "Who wants a rocket for their reward?" Here the daughter recognises the GDP of reward after used by her mother but questions the aesthetic choice and its appeal to game players.


<!-- While the final an operation for some participants it would be a more conscious process, for others it has become second nature. -->
<!-- This is seen in a similar example. As a common example the process of "getting it in the game".

    Molly - Nadine !, Nadine ! Nadine .

    Molly: Do you know how to get it in the game?
    Nadine : Oh my god!
    Molly: Well . First of all save it to the gallery. How do you save it? Ah there you are. Save it. Is it saved?   Right now export it.
    Nadine : Do you even know what export means?
    Molly: I know what export means!
    Nadine - Ok then smartie pants.

the interaction also shows positive affect of child.

#### Code Patching as a guided process

While the process of copying and pasting fixes into on-going projects is not technically equivalent to modern software patching processes, it contains many appropriate conotations. A patch is a quick fix to repair or to add new features to already existing code, supplied  to avoid a complete rewrite or more extensive process, and designed to easy for the end user to apply via a guided process. I also like the real world connotations of craft and physical repair of materials in a relatable way.  

During this process of careful documentation I became concerned that over facilitation in this instructional way would remove the possibility for errors and thus reduce the opportunities for learning from resolving failure. However, while each stage of the process of adding game pattern was documented in as complete a fashion as possible, in practice mistakes were still made and additional customisations were made. Thus while the process did reduce dependency on my input as a facilitator there were still opportunities for me to support and resolve coding errors in person.


Code patching is a processes which is suggested by the UMC process, not explicitly perhaps, but it is a logical adaptations. This is an under explored area in research and the use of code patching raises some interesting questions.  

- Question - do more useful / less de-motivating errors result from remixing and game patching?
- Question - what impact does the process of being driven by GDPs have on how users deal with errors?
- For example does the closely paired code structure and game output help with motivation?
- How do you develop a more granular sense of the kinds of blocks, errors and how to overcome them.



#### GDPs used to nurture tactical responses to coding errors

This section highlights different possible errors and notes that responses are helped by the high level of context present in the use of GDP as a structural design framework.

In analysis of journal notes and recorded screens I began to identify different kinds of coding problems that blocked participants from progressing.


In critique of online tutorials researchers note  few provide common errors[@kim_pedagogical_2017]. This lack of problem solving techniques communicated in online tutorials may addressed through use of GDPs.

Professionals build up this sense through experience. While some practices are taught many others become ad-hoc rules of thumb that are difficult to communicate in abstract ways.

More research would be welcome on how to help learners pick up these understandings.
Further analysis of the different kinds of errors that are likely to arrive and testing different strategies for dealing with them that take into account the zone or proximal development of the participants may provide not only useful input for the participants, but also opportunities to check understandings of processes and game patterns and computational patterns in use.

For example,  on into the detail and types or errors.  These include:

  -   **Syntax and Program Errors** are errors in your code which stop the game from functioning at all, often resulting in a blank screen.
  -   **No Behaviour Bugs** are errors which in your code which don't stop the game from functioning but your intended effect is not present when it should be.
  -   **Glitches** don't stop your game from running but as you play you see that there is an unintended effect. The game does something different from what we want it to do.


NOTE - Perhaps explore glitch examples.

Not fully understanding every line of code can create a fun, unpredictable environment. We can infer from these examples that wrong behaviour may be easier to investigate and to correct than no-behaviour errors. Aspects of the design encourage this kinds of error. Certainly the process of code patching does.

In a similar way that the initial provisions of a broken games are valuable to engage initial participation, the becoming of a broken GDP state, has similar potential. EXPLAIN?

This area show potential but is under explored. However, just surfacing the issue feels valid in terms of useful stream of facilitator practice to explore.


<!-- #### Examples of Glitch types of errors
Short examples of different types and the affect implications.
Glitch errors can be productive.
**Productive in exploring code / creating new game opportunites**
An interesting one where the x / y axis mix up for Te 2019-03-18 leads to a new challenge in the game.

**Productive in in**
- Glitch - 2019-05-08 - Te and Da  - create moving enemy but it totally leaves the screen. This caused amusement and participants knew how they thought they would follow that up.

 The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful. -->

#### Concluding remarks on debugging and revision

Many participants spent significant periods of time improving, testing and fixing coding errors in their games. Analysis of the coding of video data showed that revision and debugging was often a solo effort. In a way that mirrors the spread of other creative technical processes, certain revision and debugging practices that were transmitted through interaction with the facilitator that were adopted and used by the community. Some practices were straight-forward, for example the swift navigation between the source code window and a preview window of the live game. Others were more specialist like the use of the developer console of the internet browser to debug JavaScript errors or the process of hovering over red dots in the code playground to explore error messages.

<!-- PERHAPS PULL UP DETAILS OF DEBUGGING. -->

The experience of debugging appears to be a particular practice evoking certain feelings. Feelings of frustration alternate with elation at solving a tricky bug. As I built proficiency as a facilitator I began to identify different kinds of errors. The use of code patching often provoked glitch bugs which where actually behaviour did not match intended behaviour. In analysis of interactions with participants when trying to solve coding blockages, I note different strategies in responding to such errors. For some participants I quickly solve them with short explanation to allow them to continue. For other participants who I judge to be receptive I may celebrate the glitch and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that allowed the exploration of more abstract concepts using a concrete example afforded by the mechanics of the game design pattern. The following section provides an example of this kind of interaction and examines the surfacing of computational thinking concepts in particular.

<!-- While the use of debugging tools and processes are often introduced to solve a particular problem in implementing one GDP. The same process is uses to solve issues that crop up while implementing other patterns. Throughout the recordings, some individuals show an evolution of problem solving knowledge and processes in relation to coding through their independent work.

## The role of GDPs in the personal appropriation of concepts and processes

**computational, design and systems concepts**


<!-- While the contextual factors involved in this learning environment did not require alignment with a particular curriculum or external examination, computing, design and systems concepts have the potential to arise as part of the game making process. -->

<!-- In particular, the facilitator has the ability to surface and to explore more abstract concepts present in the concrete application of code that have emerged organically from the participants drives to implement particular patterns.    -->

After update and test iterations they change this to up and down key input to update y-axis velocity.

<!--

Facilitators can use a prepared collection of GDPs to facilitate participants to surface chosen computational, design and systems concepts embedded in games. In the previous chapter, the use of a map of learning dimension in the studies design was examined in relation to contextual tensions relating to the motivations surrounding of curriculum concepts.

Table 1.1. Learning Dimensions of the 3M Game Making Model


While there is a lot of potential, building testable progress in  CT and other personal dimensions are not explored significantly in this study, but are explored extensively in other research as explored in the literature review.

This can help justify activities in formal contexts as per Bevan and Petrich's work on tinkering. However, in this learning context the motivations of the learners both children and adults differ from  formal schooling setting and its requirements of teaching to a curriculum and potential exam content. Thus as there was no external imposition, and no organic desire to explore more abstract concepts.

<!-- , I could trust my instincts as a facilitator to not detract attention from participants following an organic and flexible pattern of implementation, self-testing, improvement and playtesting. -->

I also noted my own caution about overloading learners with shifting and competing goals. My concern hinged on the potential disorientation of the learner that imposed shifts of focus may provoke. As learners shift between different stages of creation the object of their activity shifts from the larger goal of making an engaging game to a narrower goal of implementing a game design pattern to narrower stoill of completing one of several actions to complete the implementation of a GDP.

<!-- In the language of activity theory the change of objective denotes is a shift in scope of the activity system. -->


**Participants appropriate such concepts and feed them back into the community.**

This dimension is not fully explored in the thesis which has a greater focus on community and social aspects of use of GDPs.

However, following Rogoff's interpretation the personal appropriation of concepts is demonstrated in community activity through evolving peer practices. As one-to-one instruction from facilitators was limited which encouraged the community to teach each other.

The process of reusing and modify code to create a computer game can surface both abstract and concrete computing concepts present in the concrete application of code that have emerged organically at different stages of the creative process.
The repeated, solo, incremental changes of the details of implementation of game design patterns indicate a personal appropriation of concepts like game feel and challenge and broad concepts of CT based on Resnick and Brennan's framework.

The following section outlines some examples:  

EXAMPLE/S:

BRIEF EXAMPLES FROM DATA FOLLOW

Following Papert and subsequent research on Microworlds, learning designers shape what they want learners to encounter and explore [research on Microworlds]. While, this thesis focuses on community aspects in line with my own interests, I have written a chapter which explores There are significant possibilities to alter this design to suit more exploration of systems concepts and computational thinking.
NOTE - INCLUDE REFERENCE TO CHAPTER



<!-- Here learner agency is transformative not only of personal dimensions of learning but also the cultural setting, practices and tools available to learners. The process of playtesting other games allowed participants to share their on emerging interpretations of game making concepts like game feel and challenge without being directly taught. Further, the community sense of what is appropriate of fun evolves as mutually and therefore cannot be taught explicitly. -->

<!-- Even, taking Wing's more abstract definition of CT, many examples arise in recorded interactions without being explicitly taught.

_Decomposition_: example of parents helping children break a larger problems into more manageable steps e.g one parent suggests to his child "Save that for version 1.1".  
_Generalisation / pattern recognition_ is present in the majority of participants as patterns are readily available to participants in starting code and the extra patches that are added. The process is repeated.
_Sequencing / algorithms_ are frequently explored in the resolution of errors with participants. In one interaction with Sh, exploring how a bracket placed in the wrong place can effectively break the game yielded a productive discussion on the importance of correct code sequencing (PERHAPS INCLUDE AS APPENDIX?). _Abstraction_, identified by Wing as the most vital CT concept, merits a deeper examination and is covered in a later section of this chapter. -->



<!-- Beyond this broad mapping of systems and computing concepts to aid facilitators to highlight I also sketched out metacognitive activities to explore these concepts on completion of each GDP. As explored in the design chapter, later revisions of the design of supporting materials for each GDP included links to online descriptions of design, systems and computational concepts. Thus, beginning with experience and progressing to analysis in a sway that mirrors reflective professional practice. However analysis of my journal entries show an ongoing reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge. -->



<!-- My intuitive reluctance to impose shifts in the scope of activity systems, can be interpreted through the lens of TADS. For me to prompt a shift to a  activities to reinforce recognitions and connection of learner generated code to computing and systems concepts, would impose a objective (first stimulus) and expose a new set of secondary stimuli for learners to draw on.
THIS SECTION NEEDS DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLEXIFICATION IN RELATION TO EXISTING RESEARCH. -->

## Discussion

The majority of this chapter has focused on interpretation of observations of participant interactions with different dimensions of use of GDPS.  

In this discussion section, I propose that GDPs provide learners with a suitable vehicle to engage with coding practices partly due to their position between abstract computational concepts and concrete implementations of code structures. I explore potential implications for facilitators and researchers on use of GDP collection as an  intermediate pedagogical construct.

I also explore GDPS as a mediational strategy using AT concepts.

### Concrete and relatable levels of abstraction - linking this communities experiences with existing literature



The process of identifying and working with GDPs in this research process can be mapped as a dialectical process of moving (rising) to the concrete [@sannino_activity_2011].

In this study, experience of the features and behaviour of game are concrete. The concept of design pattern that can be applied to more than one game is more abstract. And more abstract still are computing concepts like abstraction and pattern recognition which are present in the game code and problem solving processes.

TO ADD - The MDA framework , and related work on game design frameworks bring a focus to levels of abstraction. The utility LOA is promoted by Waite and Sentence in a focus of computing education [INSERT HOW AND WHY]. While, I chose not to explore this explicitly in my teaching, one potential avenue to explore is the question, is the design helping participants to make their concrete knowledge potentially transferable to other problems?

Around this abstract different behaviour patterns form
And the concept can be embodied on design artefacts
And can be observed an designed for.

In terms of a research process, this maps in part to the inductive process of thematic analysis.
<!-- See - https://atlasti.com/research-hub/in-vivo-coding -->

From the perspective of participants and facilitators, the process can be transferred to other design projects

    There are two types of abstractions: empirical and theoretical. Empirical abstraction
    is a classification of superficial features of phenomena. Theoretical abstraction refers to the identification of the genetic origins of phenomena that may externally be not alike at all. A theoretical abstraction is based on a functional relationship, also called a germ cell.  While observation and categorization are actions at the root of empirical abstraction, practical transformation, change, and experimentation are actions at the root of theoretical abstraction. Theoretical abstraction allows one to generate and project complex, theoretically mastered concrete manifestations and developmental forms of the reality under scrutinyTitle: Activity theory as an activist and interventionist theory, Author: Sannino, Date: 10/2011




<!-- A deeper exploration of other concepts may suit another chapter looking at synthesing observations in relation to broader research.  -->


### Design patterns as a mid-level pedagogical framework

<!-- NOTE - PARTS OF THIS WERE MOVED TO THE LIT REVIEW. -->

In chapter two I described the characteristic and limits of computational thinking as a pedagogical framework, specifically concepts include: varied interpretations; the role of levels of abstraction for teachers and learners; and the value of epistemological pluralism as a way to value concrete approaches.

---

DROP THIS PARAGRAPH? OR COMPRESS AND TACK ON TO LAST ONE?
This conception of levels abstraction can be applied in this learning design to the different scopes game making activity systems. Through this lens the most abstract activity system is the larger one who's objective, to make an engaging game that tells an environmental story, aligns with the problem level of LOA. The level between abstract and concrete is that of choosing, implementing and testing game design patterns, which aligns with design. The most concrete in this interpretation is then the implementation of different lines of code or creation and migration of digital assets.

<!--
SHIFT LATER?

As previously explored I had a reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge. My concern hinged on the potential disorientation of imposed shifts of focus between different stages of creation the object of their activity shifts from the larger goal of making an engaging game to a narrower goal of implementing a game design pattern and the technical actions and operations needed to complete it. -->

RECAP OTHER WORK ON GDP AND THEIR USES - REINTERPRETE IT VIA AT CONCEPTS - MEDIATION

In professional coding environment and training programmes design patterns are seen as a middle ground between abstract CT concepts and more concrete techniques. In chapter two I outlined the work of Eriksson and colleagues using gameplay design patterns with young people [-@eriksson_using_2019] which drew inspiration from the value of design patterns as a form of "intermediate-level concept" as advocated by fellow researchers as a way of sharing results of research [@barendregt_intermediate-level_2018]. In addition, when choosing design patterns, choosing a suitable the level of abstraction is recommended.  

    In order to be useful, patterns must present an abstraction of good practice at a meaningful level of granularity. Formulations that are too abstract will be impractical in real design use; those that are too specific will be difficult to re-use in new scenarios.[@dearden_pattern_2006, p. 20]

Similarly, here the implementation of GDPs as a key unit of activity and analysis for this study, the justification being that it was at this level that richest use and development of tools and processes by the emerging community took place.

The observations of this chapter show the advantages of GDP as an intermediate design concept, hovering in the space between too concrete to be repeated and too abstract to be grasped by novice game makers. GDPs create a tangible link between concrete player experience and the affordances of a guided creative process. Learners use of GDP as relatable and flexible constructs that facilitate  communication, sustaining engagement, planning and division of labour. The creation of designed objects using GDPS aid the personal appropriation and the propagation of technical and social processes game making practices.  



Previously abstract concepts or processes become concrete through familiarisation via direct use and indirect observations through community participation. In many of the outlined uses of GDPs in chapter we can see processes at play that help bridge shifts in design perspective (MDA here?).

Both the GDPs and the sub-actions of the wider activity design become short-cuts which stand in for previously tricky to complete set of actions. Rather than promising the transfer abstract concepts to other domains, we see learners build competency in participation in replicable processes. These processes which aid future iterations of the GDP implementation design cycle. The process of operationalisation of these sets of actions contributes to the creation of an informal, complex networked resource of operations which complement the more visible curated catalogue of GDPs.

Game design patterns or their fragments are used as a form of design short cuts. Examples from the above include, _get an enemy in_ , _animate player_ or _get it in the game_ (when referring to transferring an graphical asset from authoring tool to the coding environment). The advantages of such shortcuts are, as discussed, to help with the prioritisation and ideation processes, to facilitate peer propagation of ideas, and potentially to inform debugging and improvements to increase game playability.


There are challenges of the use of these short cuts and at a more general the design choice to lead with a menu of intermediate-level constructs in the form of a menu of GDPs. There may be confusion over use of terms to new comers and these GPD related terms may hide more complex patterns within the name. For example, the shortcuts in Mark and Ed's interaction hides a large amount of problems solving which seems "overwhelming". GDPs can limit the ideation process through an accelerated approach. Also as the menus themselves are not all used by students, and while GDPs do propagate from student to student, which risk further constraints on the process of asking questions about user experience and exploring ideas before committing to implementation.



### Implications and beginnings of suggestions for practitioners


NOTE - SUPPORT NEEDED FOR SOME OF THE BELOW - AND MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED ON CHALLENGE IN GENERAL

PRESENT IN A TABLE OR VIA SOME EASY TO PARSE HEADINGS.


The process of creating a learning design where students were able to choose from a curated set of game design patterns is covered in the design chapter of this thesis. This chapter has begun a process of exploration of the nature and evolution of agency in the practices of the participants through the varied use of GDPs.

<!-- NOTE -  REFRAMING WITH A FOCUS ON AGENCY - IDEALLY THE LATER -->
<!-- Using a choice of patterns when compared to instructional tutorials (previously explored in methods chapter)  -->

**GDPs can be used as meditational strategies within the AT framework and thus conceptual understanding of participant agency**

GDPs are frequently used as mediational strategies [@lecusay_telementoring_2015].

This can be understood in relation to relevant socio cultural theory in the following way, affordences, mutual tool development, FoI, etc.

We can frame how these process contribute to the development of agency on the part of participants in the following way.

BEGIN INTRODUCTION TO ANALYSIS OF AGENCY.

These concepts and this framing is explore in the next chapter with examples that extend beyond the use of GDPs to other cultural processes.

**The concept of a restricted activity helps us understand the value a GDP collection for participants**

The positive impact of restricted choice of activities are outlined in varied educational concepts including Bruner's reducing degrees of freedom [@wood_role_1976]. In the 3M design the process of offering a choice of games patterns emerged to counter a previous open design process of which many learners found too challenging. The patterns emerged chiefly in response to requests from learners and partly from facilitator decision making which broadly matched the criteria of the other study. However, in Eriksson's study the authors selected from an extensive, pre-existing pattern collections [@bjork_patterns_2005].


<!-- For exa In the language of double stimulation, a tension of relative inactivity at times is overcome by invitations to playtest and resulting interaction. -->


<!-- ### Link Paragraph to next chapter

A theme to follow up in the Maps / personal learning chapter is that of picking up on some of the behaviour of participants, especially that of experienced parents, experience either in coding practices of supporting their children. Once identified, how could beneficial interactions be encouraged in the next iteration of design.

Examples include;
- supporting reflection on design and coding concepts / skills.
- navigation / organisational support - use of a physical map.

For example, the use of CT concepts in a framework, listed as part of the initial design pattern card, which could then be discussed, ticked off or otherwise reflected on. -->

<!-- #### Re-examining the problem of PBL approaches considering the role of the potential of GDP collections -->

**Design Pattern collections can help structure a learning design into an inclusive pedagogy**

As explored in the literature review a key challenge to project based learning is finding appropriate conceptual and practical frameworks to scaffold domain specific working practices [@barron_doing_1998]. Different types of scaffolding are available to support PBL and the authors highlight trade-offs between engagement via tinkering and pushing "principled understanding" [@barron_doing_1998, p.63].
Design patterns have been explored as a form of scaffolding [@ertmer_scaffolding_2019] for project based learning experiences. Research on design online experiences shows value in interrelated scenarios, features and underlying patterns and principles [@mor_assessing_2014; @kali_collaborative_2006].

In computing eduction pattern based instruction has benefits of making complex problems more modular and concrete [@muller_almost_2004-1; @waite_teaching_2021].

The processes described above align with PBL and UDL in a way that merits further investigation in different settings.

<!-- NOTE - Lots of work on pedagogy of e learning done - but now seems quite dated? How did it stand up to time?  -->



#### Tensions between facilitating agency and norming practices - MOVE  up OR COMPRESS INTO THIS CHAPTER

Participants are able to use the affordances of the existing learning design and add their own evolving practice to them as a way of expressing and building agency.

However, as a seeming counterpoint to this growing agency is the norming effects of concepts that gain community currency in playtesting. The repeated attempts by participants to make the jumping mechanic of Molly less frustrating can be seen as a potential drag on the agency or autonomy of Molly as a designer. However this may be a false dichotomy. Such norming practices can be seen from a different perspective. The following chapter begins with a deeper exploration of learner agency in relation to existing research in this domain.

<!-- Examples of this dynamic agency include the use of graphical code structures, asking for peer or facilitator support etc. -->


<!-- While the process of direction may be less totally learner-driven approach than the first iteration of the learning design P1, working with a starting menu of game patterns with support still provides challenges to learners and complexity of working processes. Design blockages still occur, and participants have to work with facilitators in depth to overcome issues. There is the possibility to adapt existing patterns, to add new patterns from outside the curated collection or to shift to new game paradigm requiring a different set of patterns altogether. -->

### Summary of the pedagogical opportunities of Game Design Patterns

While their results on the advantages and challenges of patterns use focus principally on the perspective of designers (as a way to frame analysis of the activity and shifting interpretations of pattern interpretations), the participant is also shared. I explore some of the opportunities and challenges they surface addressing learner perspective.

The use of GDPs by participants has been outlined in this chapter. A summary is included in Table 6.x

GDPs served both researchers and participants by _providing a common language_ to clarify first learner expression and researcher's analysis of gameplay experience. Gdps functioned as an _inspirational structured design tool_ Eriksson's study outlines the utility notes teacher observations that GDPs served to stimulate learner imagination and ideation stages. The use of a patterns and their collection as a form _intermediate-level knowledge_ by both researchers and participants is under-explored in this study but builds on related work by two of the authors and is explored in the next part of this chapter.


### Transition to next chapter

This chapter focused on GDPs which while mostly interpersonal, guided participation also touched on emerging cultural elements of the learning community. Despite these challenges, research of data overwhelmingly indicates the positive affect of participants in implementation of GDPs. This is shown particularly in a growing sense of mastery towards technical processes becoming second nature and the resulting ability to share them with family and other peer groups. This complements previous observations on the development and nature of agency in this learning design.  The next chapter explores cultural aspects in greater detail continuing to explore emergent agency in this design by primarily focusing on a drama process as a lens for analysis.

 **Discussing Game design patterns as a tool to expose and give participants a language to discuss and resolve tensions (Practitioner focus)**

 This section;
 - synthesises examples which highlight the value of developing share language and short cuts
 - explores possible drawbacks
 - looks at restricted

 Examples of short cuts include, "get an enemy in", animate player from Ed and Ma's exerpts.

 The advantages of such shortcuts are, as discussed to help with the prioritisation and ideation processes, to facilitate peer propagation of ideas, and potentially to inform debugging and improvements to increase game playability.

 However, there are challenges of the use of such short cuts including;
 - hiding more complex patterns within the name.
 - confusion over use of terms to new comers

 For example the shortcut of a name for a pattern in Ed and Ma's interaction hides a large amount of problems solving which seems "overwhelming" -->

<!-- ### Call back to design practices
As per last chapter but develop in relation to GDPs -->
<!-- However from the novice designers' perspective, there are elements of patterns involved. -->
<!--
**Exploring the grokkable nature of GDPs**

 GDPs if well designed can be accessible in this grokkable way.
The term grok is used here to indicate an embodied, intuitive understanding that mirrors the concept of deep learning. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok

Repeated practice is an important part of this process.
Other examples of grokking concepts? -->

## Disregarded or Next Steps Data

We can also compare the patterns and also the frequency of these interactions with a future session later in the year. COULD DO BUT SIDELINE FOR NOW - ADD TO NEXT STAGES? -->
