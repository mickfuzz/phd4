## Exploring issues and context from practitioner interviews and existing research

While the literature on game making and other forms of digital making is extensive, much has a focus on curricula driven, personal knowledge. Research in the domain of informal learning and the resulting characteristics and emerging tensions is less prevalent. In addition the process of writing interview questions and the conversational process of semi-structured interviews helped expose new streams of thought, that which while present in existing researched helped bring them into clearer focus.

**Summary of background of interviewees**

Saskia Leggett is a researcher who was active in the in Creative Family Learning program under direction of Ricarosa Roque. She took a leading role in creating the programme's support resources. Matt Curinga is an academic at Columbia and teaches in educational technology and computer science. He is also active in a non-profit organisation, Zero Day Camp, promoting learning coding and engineering through engaging projects. Dave  Potts is a professional programmer and a parent and volunteer at Coder Dojo which is a volunteer run teaching technology monthly event. James Clegg is PGCE Computing student/teacher and volunteer student helper for the game making programme.

**Summary of themes emerging**

In my analysis, I have proritised data which in forms the first research question and specifically addressing barriers and tensions for both practitioners and participants which exist in this domain of activity.

**Additional short commentary**

The themes that emerged above.

One key issue is the clash of cultures. EDIT DOWN AND COMMENT


    There's this idea of a clash of cultures where to learn like the dominant school culture, you have to release some of your self-identity or you need to learn to bridge these worlds. ... (in) the literature, that there's this resistance of seeing yourself as someone who does STEM, as someone who does computer science. It's like we're not people that do that. And I think by doing it with their family, like there's no better way to kind of mitigate that effect and that hesitation, that barrier, because they're all becoming your whole family, like your, your closest identity is becoming people that write code or people that make robots.

This interview references research already explored in the literature review concerning identity and alienation from STEM contexts.  






## Discussion section


### Discussion on Authenticity of Tools and Resources - SHIFT OR REVISE SOMEHOW TO REALLY REDUCE IMPACT? TO METHODS AGAIN?

This chapter has exposed the tensions that developed in the activity systems and subsequent evolution the tools used. The term tools here is used broadly in line with AT's definition to include code authoring environment, supporting resources of printed and digital format, etc. This section begins to explore the value and implications of my choice to privilege authenticity of tool choice in this design.

<!-- NOTE- This chapter's coverage of tool use is incomplete and the use of physical arcade consoles is explored in chapter six.  -->

#### Empowerment implications of lifting the hood to expose underlying technology

An inspirational aspect of _lifting the hood_ (see LR) on previously unknown technology was reflected in a conversation among adult participants. They communicated a sense of awe of how much effort and coding must be involved in a professional game based on the relative complexity of the code of their simple game.  

    Pearl: It just shows you what goes into these games.
    Student Helper3: Think about how much effort goes into.
    Pearl: You just take things for granted donâ€™t you?
    [FIND IN 2019-03-18-ch_pa_TOCODE].

Such finding support the motivations of many youth programs which advocate exploration of the technologies which are normally hidden from view as an tactic for empowerment.

<!-- There are similarities and differences between the use of code playgrounds and templates by novices and professionals. A possible interpretation of the use of a template as scaffolding provided in an educational context is that that support is inconsistent with a work place setting environment. However, the use of starter templates is also a common work place tactic.

The motivations for creating starter templates are similar. Both educators and professional template creators want to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying web-technology and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency. For the learners of this study, agency is expressed via inclusion of home interests, play with dynamics and game layout. The motivations of the professional would include experimentation to check if the framework will support desired end user features. This work helps analysis if it is worth allocating time learning the details of the framework in question.   -->

#### Authenticity of processes and documentation

From early stages in this design, I stopped encouraging participants to search within authentic documentation and help forum for the professional and amateur users of the Phaser javascript library. Instead, in response to participant need, I created  bespoke code examples in an online collection. Thus creating a pragmatic replica of authentic process of finding and incorporating code snippets. The careful alignment between tools code documentation and the starting template was designed to address barriers to the development skills used in authentic code based game making and professional coding. The impact of this is explored chapter five.

An illustrative design tension emerged surrounding which kind of documentation to prioritise. After initially  steering participants directly to code snippets, I subsequently directed them instead to step by step tutorials which also included a link to the code snippets. In retrospect, my interpretation is that I prioritised the traditional form of instruction over more authentic, bricolage-like (see LR) developer practices. I propose it would be best to rectify this value judgement, in future iterations of the design giving each equal weight.  

<!-- Research on other toolsets is instructive when exploring learning design tensions involving issues of authenticity and agency. -->
<!-- MOVE TO LR
Existing research on computing projects in the work of Papert [-@papert_mindstorms_1980] on Mircoworlds and subsequent research on programming tools in the constructionist tradition were explored in brief in the literature review. [@kafai_constructionism_1996-1; @kafai_mindstorms_2014]. While, examples of a Microworlds are diverse [@rieber_microworlds_2004], a Turtle drawing world using  LOGO can be used here as an example. In the Mathland of the turtle which speaks only LOGO, children are drawn to speak LOGO to progress. The affordances of the physical turtle provide visible motivation.  -->

#### Analysing the use of code playground and templated approach through the lens of authenticity

REFRAME ANALYSIS VIA HCI / AFFORDENCES / HEURISTICS? SIGNPOST AS A MID LEVEL PEDAGOGY POTENTIALY REPLICABLE


The affordances of the physical turtle provide visible motivation and the embedded concepts of algebra are experienced by children directly rather than through instruction. A similar process happens in this design. The map of learning dimensions outlined above details some of embedded concepts brought to the fore for students to bump against in their play and experimentation. An additional set of embedded concepts are GDPs which are explore in more details in chapter five.


#### Linking authenticity and agency - SHIFT TO CHAPTER 6 OR 7



DUPLICATION - MOVE HERE?

<!-- In chapters two and three the concepts of agency in learning settings uncovered varied forms of agency. The forms most related to this study was instrumental agency and authorial agency.   -->





Analysis of the video data of participants using the more fragmented tool set used, which involve one online tool for coding and others for asset authoring, reveals a large number of broader digital literacy skills.

For example, the processes of replacing a block image with a bespoke pixel sprite which comprised: file downloading; file migration using the browser and file manager; browser tab navigation; graphics tool use in Piskel (a simplified Photoshop including - crop, fill and export tools); copying and paste text code; and selecting more than one lines of text code with mouse or keyboard shortcuts. Undertaking the full process involved learning a complex chain of  these individual actions.

<!-- IS THERE DUPLICATION HERE - OPERATION ALSO ANALYSE VIA AT? -->
Some participants became remarkably adapt at this, thus transforming this chain of actions into a fluid operation. Learners who had mastered the skills were asked by others for help. The rapid adoption and transfer of these processes between community members indicated a high motivational factor for participants of incorporating self-created graphical elements, a topick which is also addressed in the following section.  

<!-- **Future work** MakeCode Arcade shows promise as an easier to use microworld geared to the use of design patterns. While this is beyond the remit of this study I did gather data. However, I would regather to allow for better focus of research questions.   -->

#### Summary / Link

While the use of authentic tools and processes, while challenging for novices, can be facilitated by careful alignment of key design principles and other pedagogies. For example, while the complexity of authentic text code languages and authentic developer focused documentation can be intimidating, a following chapter explores the potential for drama processes to address learner anxiety in this domain.

<!-- There is a connection in this process to foundational theories in the area of HCI and computing education.
In particular the term and theory surrounding the design in in affordances to support and guide participant progress  is instructive and is explored in more details in chapter five and six. -->

My own reluctance to simplify for the sake of authenticity was mitigated by the influence of participants and other collaborators in the design process. For example, the input of trainee teachers whose recent experience of supporting learners creative intitial scaffolding of task in much more detail than I would have.
