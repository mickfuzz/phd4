## Exploring issues and context from practitioner interviews and existing research

While the literature on game making and other forms of digital making is extensive, much has a focus on curricula driven, personal knowledge. Research in the domain of informal learning and the resulting characteristics and emerging tensions is less prevalent. In addition the process of writing interview questions and the conversational process of semi-structured interviews helped expose new streams of thought, that which while present in existing researched helped bring them into clearer focus.

**Summary of background of interviewees**

Saskia Leggett is a researcher who was active in the in Creative Family Learning program under direction of Ricarosa Roque. She took a leading role in creating the programme's support resources. Matt Curinga is an academic at Columbia and teaches in educational technology and computer science. He is also active in a non-profit organisation, Zero Day Camp, promoting learning coding and engineering through engaging projects. Dave  Potts is a professional programmer and a parent and volunteer at Coder Dojo which is a volunteer run teaching technology monthly event. James Clegg is PGCE Computing student/teacher and volunteer student helper for the game making programme.

**Summary of themes emerging**

In my analysis, I have proritised data which in forms the first research question and specifically addressing barriers and tensions for both practitioners and participants which exist in this domain of activity.

|Issue                    | Instances |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Barrier: Isolation during problems solving increases frustration and inhibits learning                                                      | 3         |
| Tension: the goal for students to be self-directed vs. the advantages of providing a shared collaborative foundation for production         | 4         |
| Tactic: Non-coding activities amd games to increase group connections as a good preparation for coding related challenges and frustrations. | 5         |
| Barrier: students not considering them selves as STEM / coding types of people                                                              |           |
| Barrier: logistical issues of time and equipment in school settings                                                                         |           |

**Additional short commentary**

The themes that emerged above.

One key issue is the clash of cultures. EDIT DOWN AND COMMENT


    There's this idea of a clash of cultures where to learn like the dominant school culture, you have to release some of your self-identity or you need to learn to bridge these worlds. ... (in) the literature, that there's this resistance of seeing yourself as someone who does STEM, as someone who does computer science. It's like we're not people that do that. And I think by doing it with their family, like there's no better way to kind of mitigate that effect and that hesitation, that barrier, because they're all becoming your whole family, like your, your closest identity is becoming people that write code or people that make robots.

This interview references research already explored in the literature review concerning identity and alienation from STEM contexts.
