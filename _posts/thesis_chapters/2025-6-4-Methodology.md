# Methodology

## Introduction

This chapter sets out the methodological approach underpinning this study, building directly from the theoretical commitments explored in Chapter 3. Drawing on the principles of activity theory  and design-based research (DBR), this research was designed as an iterative, situated process embedded in a real-world, non-formal learning environment. Rather than applying a fixed method to a controlled setting, the study developed responsively, shaped by the complex interplay of context, participant input, and pedagogical experimentation.

Chapter 3 introduced the conceptual foundations shaping this approach: learning as socially and historically situated, agency as emergent and distributed, and design as a driver of transformation. These principles are here translated into methodological commitments, especially a focus on mutuality with participants, flexibility in design, and responsiveness to the evolving dynamics of the setting. The chapter begins by establishing the scope of the research as qualitative, general, and exploratory. It then discusses the authenticity of the context, the significance of my dual role as researcher-facilitator, and the rationale for a method that privileges a rich approach to detail. Following this, the chapter details how the project was delivered in practice, including the recruitment process, session formats, and the diverse forms of data collected such as journal entries, artefacts, video and screen recordings.

The analytical process developed over three broad stages. In the early phase, journal reflections, interviews and preliminary video reviews helped surface initial patterns and contradictions. This was followed by a deeper exploratory phase of theme clustering and iterative coding, including attempts at both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The final stage involved selecting key vignettes for closer analysis, integrating participant voices and triangulating across data sources to refine conceptual insights into learner agency, tool use, and learning processes. The chapter concludes with reflections on ethical considerations, validity  of the data analysis, returning to the methodological frameworks of activity theory and DBR, considering how this study both draws from and contributes to those evolving traditions. At this stage the limitations of the thesis are also examined.


<!-- As previously explored, the research questions invite a broad spectrum of analysis - cultural and social factors. -->
<!-- The depth justifies smaller data size and depth of analysis. -->
### Defining Scope and Approach

This chapter outlines a methodological approach grounded in the general principles of formative interventions and design-based research (DBR). To do this it will  draw on techniques from those disciplines including specifically social design-based experiments (SDBE) and design-based implementation research (DBIR) [@penuel_design-based_2021].

While the previous chapters have established the theoretical framework and research questions, this chapter connects those questions more directly to methods. To provide a an overview to ground the reader, an outline how the research questions informed data collection, analysis, and theoretical framing follows:

**RQ1**: *What contradictions emerged during participation in CGD&P activities, and how were they addressed via an innovative pedagogy?*  
Data were drawn from video observations, participant and practitioner interviews, facilitator reflections, and gameplay interactions. These were analysed through systemic tension mapping and activity system analysis, using cultural-historical activity theory to frame contradictions as drivers of expansive transformation.

**RQ2**: *How can a collection of game design patterns support CGD&P, particularly regarding abstract and concrete dimensions of existing pedagogies?*  
Data included gameplay documentation, screen capture analysis, and participant reflections on pattern use. Thematic analysis focused on mediation through design patterns and how these related to shifts in learning activity. Framing drew on the mediational lens of CHAT and the pedagogical scaffolding emphasis of DBR.

**RQ3**: *How do learner agency and game-maker identity develop within CGD&P communities of practice, and what pedagogical strategies best support this evolution across diverse learning contexts?*  
A longitudinal dataset spanning phases of community interactions and design development, interviews, and field notes was analysed through thematic clustering, relational mapping, and narrative analysis. This was informed by DBR’s emphasis on iterative refinement and 3GAT’s view of expansive learning in situated activity.

### A Qualitative, General, and Exploratory Approach

This study is qualitative, general, and exploratory in nature, shaped by DBR and CHAT. It adopts an iterative, context-sensitive approach to understanding learning environments in CGD&P, avoiding rigid experimental constraints. In terms of educational objectives, the goal is to generate situated knowledge that can inform responsive educational practices rather than to produce more universally generalisable outcomes [@cobb_design_2003]. However, the methodology of this research also seeks to reveal pedagogical tensions, contradictions, and shifts in learner agency and develop understandings which have potential for a broader application.

Rather than starting with fixed aims, the inquiry evolved through mutual engagement with participants and an openness to emergent goals. This orientation is justified both by the nature of the setting (non-formal, collaborative, and often resistant to conventional evaluation [CITAION]) and by the desire to avoid prematurely deciding on what kinds of pedagogical or methodological innovations might arise. While certain features remained consistent throughout, the process was fundamentally shaped by what unfolded during iterative cycles of engagement.

<!-- ### Iterative Development with Participant Input -->

Pedagogical elements of the research design were  co-developed through collaboration with young learners, their families, and undergraduate student helpers. Over time, iterative design phases were informed by participant feedback, emergent needs, and reflection on practice. This collaborative shaping of both tools and pedagogy reflects established principles in participatory research [@iversen_computational_2018-1; @iivari_critical_2017], DBR [@barab_design-based_2004], and formative interventions [@cole_fifth_2006; @blunden_formative_2023].

Participant input took multiple forms: direct feedback in interviews and structured activities, observations of gameplay and design behaviour, and artefacts produced in workshops. The ongoing trialling and adjustment of software environments, templates, and resources took place over an extended period and, involved undergraduate trainees, colleagues, and parent volunteers. These iterative changes are documented throughout the study and explored further in Chapters 5 to 7.

Bakker offers guidance in the formulation of research questions in DBR studies which are relevant to this thesis [@bakker_design_2018]. He promotes HOW and WHAT CONSIDERATIONS formulation of question to be represent the exploratory nature of DBR approaches and to increase the possibility of possible generalisation without over promising in terms of projecting beyond the embedded nature of the findings as embedded in the context of the study.

### Utility, Holistic Data and  Rich Descriptions  

This study provide _thick_, descriptive accounts of learning in CGD&P across multiple levels of activity [@maxwell_qualitative_2013]. Informed by Rogoff’s [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of analysis in communities of learners, data collection included both individual and group-level video capture, journal notes, screen recordings, and design artefacts. These layered sources enabled analysis of how learning processes unfolded across time, tools, and interactions. This approach also brought challenges, particularly in managing and interpreting complex video data, which are discussed later in this chapter.

The commitment to rich description is not just analytical rigour but also driven by the purpose of sharing of pedagogical practice to fellow practitioners. Following Ann Brown’s original call for design experiments to align with the needs of real-world learning contexts [@brown_design_1992], and later work by Bakker and Penuel, for utility to be at the heart of the DBR process, this research prioritises design decisions that allow for replicability in both academic and diverse educational contexts.

Applied to software, tools should be replicable within the target audience of informal settings which may have restricted budget.  FLOSS or freely available tools were used wherever feasible, following software sustainability principles [@crouch_software_2013], and ensuring that both the pedagogical design and research methodology can be adopted or adapted by others [@bonneel_code_2020].

### Authentic and Ecological Orientation

To produce findings are contextually valid and socially relevant, pedagogical interventions too place within a real-world CGD&P learning programme in a non-formal educational context shaped by home education practices, local community logistics, and varied participant demographics. This ecological embeddedness shaped recruitment, session scheduling, and the kinds of learning interactions that were possible (covered in a following section). These factors also brought an authenticity that aligns with ecosystem models of learning design [@barnett_ecosystem_2019]  where value is created through contextually relevant pedagogical engagement.

### Researcher–Facilitator Dual Role

My role as both researcher and facilitator was central to the methodological design. Each data collection session was also a workshop, planned and adapted to meet the varied needs of participants. While this dual role introduced challenges such as balancing intervention with observation and recognising positionality, it also provided opportunities for sustained engagement, flexible design, and a clearer view of pedagogical evolution in action.

As explored in Fifth Dimension work by Cole and others, this researcher-practitioner stance invites critical reflection on the ethics, logistics, and value of practice-based inquiry. Throughout the process, I aimed to recognise and support emergent participant practices, using tools and scaffolds that could adapt dynamically. These choices are revisited across the following findings chapters, which trace how participants responded to, reshaped, and extended the learning environment.



## Data collection within project delivery phases

This section addresses both the phases of delivery of the game making programme to families and the data collection that occurred at each phase.

As the next chapter outlines the evolution of the learning intervention as a design narrative, discussion of learning design will be brief here and concerned with overall methodology of collection and analysis.

A summary of the delivery phases and one key development period are outlined in a graphical representation below in Fig 4.x. to help situate the following descriptions and discussion.

### Recruitment and data on participants

<!-- Home education groups operate in varied ways, and in my experience are characterised by loose ties rather than strong formal bonds. -->

In early 2016 I had carried out an exploratory workshop with home educators to explore future partnerships with the enrichment programme of the Faculty of Education [^el]. The process of recruiting was facilitated by the running of on going one off workshops which were similar in scope via the EdLab funologists strand of playful technology project. Specifically, half term events at Manchester Libraries and in the University and at Coder Dojo week end events.

This work meant I was in regular contact with some home educators and posting opportunities on their forum contributed to an ongoing relationship within the three existing home education communications networks used to share information and experiences [he]. To recruit participant I circulated a simple text to participants asking them to get in touch via email. When participants got in touch I emailed adults the relevant participation sheet and asked them to confirm their interest.

This process is covered in the ethics later in this chapter below.

<!-- WHAT IS THE FOUNDATION FOR ANALYSIS ?

#### On mutuality of design and practicalities of  collection during phases

APPENDIX LINK OUT

The process of creating resources also occurred in phases which had input from participants.

**Types of input by Participants**



This an iterative approach is evident in the evolution of the learning design and resources. For example, the trialling of the coding environment and starting templated occurred over and extended period and with input and concrete additions from parent volunteers, graduate trainee-teacher students, undergraduate students helpers University colleagues and with more indirect ongoing feedback from participating young people and their guardians. Input took varied forms.

Direct input was through help requests made by participants and feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.


Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews.

Indirect input was also at play in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants.


<!-- D1 and D2:

D1 Before engaging with families in P1 I followed tutorials on Mozilla's developer community website on writing games in javascript. I had used Mozilla's Thimble code playground tool in earlier work teaching javascript, a snapshot of which is available as PGCE dissertation [@chesterman_webmaking_2015].

D2 - One-off workshops at Mozilla, Feral Vector and Manchester libraries events and to PGCE computer students helped focus and the creation of a game template and supporting resources. -->


<!--
P2, A game making course of 6 weeks. The template and resources created D2 were used as a starting point but still under rapid development based on informal participant feedback and my journal reflections.

Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.

P3 used the same toolset as P2 however in addition, drew on my previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department [@caldwell_drama_2019] to create a simple drama process to give an external motivation and narrative to the creation of games using for a fictional audience of visiting aliens. The participant activity of these stages and tensions between system elements are discussed in detail in the remainder of this chapter and in following chapters.


The last iterations of the learning design adopted the MakeCode Arcade tool as a new game authoring tool [mc].
I adapted and advanced resources with an aim that they could be used within secondary classrooms to support computing curriculum.
The facilitation techniques and approach were adapted from those of P2 to facilitate the use of the block coding language . Tool use at this stage is also explored in a chapter in a collection on K-12 computing education [@chesterman_game_2023]. -->

### Data collection of journal notes and facilitation artefacts

Auto-ethnographic data collection

I used journal notes extensively in a notebook format and in electronic format within chronologically categorised word processing documents. These notes involved a mix of session planning, resource planning, immediate reflections on sessions, and notes on links with existing literature.

In addition, I also carefully collected the session resources themselves in terms of the tools used and supporting documentation and activities.

The games and artefacts themselves also are data of a sort.

**Rationale**


Principle of double stimulation, and adoption of tools for different purposes than originally intended.

Allowing movement, and mutuality,

link to 5thD and other studies guided by

Also introduce the process of Chapter 5 design narrative

**Practicalities and Challenges**

_Journal data formats_

- Book Journal pages
- Digital journal entries directly in response to teaching sessions
- Other subject specific journal notes.



**A challenge of data collection of artefacts**

In terms of the sustainability of the data collected. This was tested in the final stages of writing when the site on which the games and images were stored glitch.com announced it would stop hosting in July 2025. The data was migrated by downloading html, javascript, css and image files as a bulk download and reuploading to a git repository [gm].

Projects created in piskel were lost, but exported data remains.

_game data_

The process of keeping game data created within  online and available is tricky.
However, as files were HTML, js and css. Offline archives were created for later use. Helpful in case of Thimble as the project was discontinued.

WRONG!
As of the time of writing Glitch.com, the replacement remains. A selection of games created remain here [gg].



### Video data collection via 360 and screen capture

**Summary**

Screen capture is a process which allows the recording of data of what is happening on the screen of computers. It optionally allows the audio being played

I chose the software flashback pro primarily as it was installed on and available at low cost on home computers. No FLOSS equivalent was available. Flashback saves data in a format. This include audio, video screen capture, learner keystrokes, mouse movements and optionally one or more webcams. I decided not to record on webcams for the following reasons:

- intrusive feel - having the webcam on and the resulting red light on the screen, I felt was less conducive to feeling comfortable than one 360 camera in the middle of the room.
- less resources - recording webcam on the laptop
- reduced video file size of final data file
- less complexity when processing data -

It not possible to code the natively created files directly. Thus need to be converted to mp4 to import into coding software like Nvivo. In this process the keyboard and mouse data is lost.

**Rationale**

Video "rich" data collections

Environmental - i.e. in situ - and as a form of activity that fit within the pattern of home ed families existing activities.

### Practicalities of data collection and processing

While the rich set of data invites the cross referencing of the many sources, it also presents challenge on how to deal effectively with the large amounts of data being gathered. The use of a 360 camera reduces the amount of live video footage of interactions needed. Instead of multiple cameras pointed in different directions to capture participant interaction, participants are arranged in a square pointing inwards towards a central 360 degree camera.

Check viability of data at each stage of processing and movement.

#### 360 Video Processing


The processing of video and audio data of both captured screens and 360 video data and high quality audio data involved several stages yielding advantages in capturing the gestures and facial expressions of potentially all participants in one recording. It does however present challenges. While this merits further exploration a brief summary of challenges is presented here.

The process involves large video files that are easily corrupted in transfer. While the files are split into 8 minute segments  but also can be confusing
- time navigation - also confusing - sometimes put up on the screen - but inconsistently
- moving and keeping a track of data from week to week and over years is complex.
- processing data requires special software - from samsung
- viewing data on a normal vlc player - needs extra processing using spatial media

<!-- Thus original files have been retained in order to cross reference that data if it is useful. It also presents other options for analysis which are similar to much more in depth analysis of HCI research of professional set ups. While this is beyond the remit of this study, certain uses do present themselves strongly for future investigation. Particularly the study of such data to identify common mistakes or frustrations when interacting with the user interface.

## Data analysis process

The analysis was structured in three stages to reflect the evolving relationship between the data and the research questions. This staged approach allowed for an iterative process: beginning with exploratory review, progressing through thematic refinement and methodological adjustment, and concluding with interpretive consolidation. Each stage responded to new insights and practical constraints, and together they represent a strategy for understanding how learning, agency, and contradiction played out within the CGD&P interventions.

Due to the exploratory nature of the research and the openness to emergent directions, the analysis process evolved iteratively across multiple stages. For the purposes of clarity, this process is presented in three simplified stages that reflect broad shifts in focus and method. Each stage marks a move toward greater granularity, using different analytical strategies suited to the emerging needs of the study. This structure also proved particularly useful in managing the large volume of video and screen capture data generated during the CGD&P sessions.

### Stage 1 - Exploratory analysis

Stage 1 served as a exploratory review of the dataset to assess data quality, relevance, and initial themes. This included reviewing researcher journals, practitioner interviews, and preliminary video footage to develop a sense of the emerging pedagogical and methodological issues. The goal was to understand the types of contradictions and learning behaviours present, and to inform the next steps for more focused analysis. This phase aimed to determine which datasets merited deeper analysis and refine the methodological processes for subsequent analytical stages, aligning with approaches of iterative refinement in DBR [@bikner-ahsbahs_introduction_2015-1].

The process was initially driven by the need to produce a summary of the facilitation process and to surface contextual tensions for a book chapter [@chesterman_game_2023], as well as to contribute to a mapping of learning dimensions developed during the D3 phase for online resource design [lm]. Journal analysis provided a foundational perspective on facilitation and early thematic tensions. Given the breadth of journal data, a comprehensive thematic analysis and exhaustive coding was impractical; instead, insights were triangulated with findings from the literature review to expose key themes and contradictions in the evolving pedagogy. Rogoff’s [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of sociocultural activity were particularly useful here, allowing reflections on facilitation to be categorised across personal, interpersonal, and institutional dimensions, a technique further refined by Morcom [-@morcom_scaffolding_2014]. Alongside journal entries, evolving teaching resources, participant-created games, and assets  were examined to provide insight into how learners engaged with design elements, navigated  constraints, and appropriated resources for their own purposes. The use of these materials  informed subsequent iterations of facilitation and resource development, and contributed to  the emergent facilitation strategy.

Practitioner interviews were used alongside journal reflections to identify key pedagogical concerns, barriers to participation, and evolving priorities within the learning design. Four extended interviews (averaging 90 minutes each) were conducted with professionals and collaborators from overlapping fields. The semi-structured format allowed for responsive dialogue, helping to surface themes such as learner identity, creative constraint, scaffolding strategies, and the design tensions in non-formal learning contexts. Themes included: agency as a focus, which emerged from Dave Potts’ reflections on the value of surfacing and supporting participants’ own interests in digital making; the value and tensions surrounding competition in non-formal settings, raised by Matt Curringa; the helping roles played by parents in young people's engagement with technology, highlighted by Saskia Leggett; and the affordances of online toolkits and game mechanics as mediational strategies, discussed by James Clegg. These interviews also helped focus subsequent cycles of video analysis by informing early coding directions and refinement of the research questions.

Finally, video data was explored through a broad review of selected screen capture and 360-degree recordings from P2, P3, and P4. This initial dip into the video archive was used to assess both the quality and analytic potential of the recordings. Observations were recorded using a spreadsheet format and structured around Rogoff’s [@rogoff_observing_1995] three-plane framework. This approach provided an initial sense of the rhythms of sessions, the emergence of roles, and the unfolding of mediational practices. At this stage, full transcription was not attempted; instead, time-stamped observations helped determine which sessions might warrant deeper analysis in subsequent stages.

This first stage set the foundation for the later interpretive work by clarifying the practical constraints of the data, surfacing early thematic directions, and testing the viability of a multi-source, iterative approach.



### Stage 2 – Thematic Refinement

The second stage of analysis began with the intention of developing a structured coding schema that could support both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Inspired by a desire to systematically compare themes across video data, interviews, and journals, the original plan involved using NVivo (a qualitative-first data analysis software that also supports mixed-methods queries) to apply a consistent thematic structure, combining insights from the literature, practitioner interviews, and preliminary analysis. NVivo allows researchers to apply codes across datasets and run queries, for example to examine how much time participants spent on specific tasks or how often particular behaviours occurred.

However, as the coding process began, a number of challenges arose. Technically, NVivo struggled to handle the extended screen and 360-degree video files smoothly. Syncing multiple video streams, switching between screen capture and wide-view footage, and viewing timestamps simultaneously became cumbersome. At one point, a workaround using VLC Player allowed for dual playback, and time-coded observations were trialled using five-minute transcription segments imported into Word and then into NVivo. But even this solution remained resource-intensive and prone to breakdown. The complexity of comparing behaviours across screen and 360 recordings also made queries and coding comparisons inconsistent or difficult to manage.

These frustrations coincided with more conceptual questions. It became clear that applying a fixed coding frame would risk obscuring key features of the learning environment, particularly the emergent, improvisational, and tool-mediated aspects of learner agency. Some candidate codes, such as computational thinking, were deprioritised due to either their conceptual overlap with existing literature or a lack of richness in the CGD&P data. Other categories, such as game design stages, became harder to apply consistently across groups and sessions. A rigid schema, in this case, risked flattening what was most interesting: the improvised use of resources, peer scaffolding, and negotiation of meaning in action.

The shift from planned coding to a more interpretive, emergent strategy was not abrupt; it evolved through repeated attempts to organise, code, and revisit earlier transcripts. The use of Rogoff’s three planes of analysis (personal, interpersonal, and cultural) became increasingly helpful as a scaffolding framework. Instead of developing a strict taxonomy, the process moved towards memoing, sketching, and thematically clustering insights using Word documents. These techniques allowed a more flexible and responsive mode of interpretation that could adjust to the complexity of participant behaviour, tool use, and social interaction.

To manage the scope of analysis, ten sessions were selected for deeper review. Criteria included clarity of audio and visuals, richness of peer and facilitator interaction, and representation of different phases of the intervention. In practice, most of the analysis focused on data from phases P2 and P3, as these contained the richest examples of interaction. One session from the end of P2, in particular, stood out due to the complexity of collaboration and the variety of participant roles observed. Transcripts were created in five-minute intervals, pairing 360-degree footage with screen recordings. These were not fully coded line-by-line, but were annotated descriptively with researcher memos noting tensions, tool use, gestures, and participant roles. In some cases, episodes were flagged for deeper treatment in later vignette analysis.

A sample spreadsheet of analysis structured using Rogoff’s three planes is included in the appendix, along with a word-processed document representing one screen capture recording. In this context, the term refers to a segment of recorded participant activity captured via screen recording, typically involving one learner or a pair working at a laptop during a broader workshop session.

While NVivo was initially used to trial some of this coding process, its limitations ultimately led to the adoption of Word-based transcription and thematic logging. This shift reflected a broader methodological commitment: staying close to the activity as it unfolded, rather than forcing it into predefined analytic categories. The process of trying, adapting, and discarding coding strategies also mirrored the study’s broader design ethos, where tools and structures evolved in response to emergent practice instead of being imposed from above.

As new patterns emerged, such as the significance of game design patterns in shaping learner trajectories or the role of peers and parents in scaffolding complex actions, the original research questions were refined. This phase helped surface key areas for Stage 3, including clusters of agency, mediational strategies, and participant repertoires. It also clarified which transcripts and artefacts were most generative for deep, vignette-style interpretation. By the end of this stage, the goal had shifted decisively away from quantifying learning behaviours and toward richly describing how learners appropriated tools and reshaped their participation. What began as a trial of software and schema evolved into a process of conceptual grounding through situated observation and practical compromise.


### Stage 3 – Interpretive Consolidation

The third and final stage of analysis focused on consolidating insights through detailed, interpretive work. Building on the broad mapping of Stage 1 and the thematic refinement of Stage 2, this phase returned to key segments of data selected for their richness, complexity, and relevance to the evolving research questions. The goal was to generate grounded, contextualised understandings of learner agency, design mediation, and pedagogical interaction through the construction of vignettes.

This stage centred on four key vignettes drawn from screen capture and 360-degree video recordings. These were chosen for their representation of diverse learner roles, visible design decision-making, and interactional dynamics. Full transcriptions were produced for these segments, integrating verbal dialogue, on-screen activity, and embodied communication such as gestures and movement within the learning space. Viewing the 360 footage alongside the screen capture recordings proved essential in several cases, especially where participants referenced their physical environment or used gesture to support peer explanation.

These vignettes were not designed to be representative in a statistical sense, but to offer textured accounts of how specific learners or pairs navigated their tools, peers, and task structures. Each vignette was treated as a situated episode that could illuminate broader pedagogical questions, including how learners asserted agency, interpreted guidance, or adapted resources. Where possible, these micro-analyses were triangulated with post-session interview data, artefacts (such as games or design notes), and reflective journal entries made immediately after facilitation.

One focus during this stage was to examine the ways game design patterns (GDPs) operated as mediational tools. A coding spreadsheet, developed during Stage 2, was extended to cluster GDP use across planes of activity (individual, interpersonal, and cultural). Patterns of adaptation and reinterpretation were particularly salient, as learners often modified a pattern’s purpose or linked it to emergent gameplay goals. These shifts were interpreted through a CHAT lens as evidence of agency enacted through tool transformation and appropriation.

In parallel, the concept of learner agency was refined through a return to participant action across different learning contexts. This included recognition of how agency was distributed over time, scaffolded by peers and parents, and shaped by opportunities to explore, remix, and perform learning in varied modes. Gestural and embodied data played a key role here, with several vignettes including analysis of how learners moved around the room, negotiated turn-taking, or used physical props alongside digital tools. One vignette in particular was prompted by feedback from Ricardo Nemirovsky, who encouraged a more deliberate integration of gesture analysis.

This interpretive work aimed to clarify not only how the learning environment supported certain forms of agency and design fluency, but also what constraints remained. In some vignettes, learners struggled to access tools or articulate their ideas, prompting reflections on equity, inclusion, and the role of facilitation. These observations informed both the final conceptual model (developed in Chapter 7) and ongoing questions about how pedagogical environments can be designed to support participation across multiple modes and identities.

By the end of this stage, the analysis had shifted from mapping general trends to closely engaging with specific examples that embodied tensions and possibilities within the CGD&P project. These vignettes became the foundation for articulating the study’s contributions to both theory and practice.

### Ethical Considerations

Ethical approval for this study was obtained through the ESRI ethics process using the ETHOS system. Participants were recruited via outreach to home education networks, coding events and community meet-ups. Consent and assent processes were tailored to suit different participant groups, including home-educating families, children and university students. For children, assent was negotiated through informal discussion followed by a simple written agreement, and parents remained nearby or directly involved throughout.

While data collection involved video and screen recordings that could not be fully anonymised at source, all analytic materials and outputs used pseudonyms, removed or obscured identifying visuals, and were stored on encrypted drives with limited access. DBS-checked adult facilitators and volunteers supported sessions, and alternative activities were always available so that children could opt out at any time. These steps aimed to protect participant autonomy while recognising the relational dynamics of informal learning settings.

### Interpretive Validity

This study adopted a critical stance on objectivist notions of validity, drawing on DBR and CHAT traditions that position the researcher as an active participant in meaning-making. Validity was approached through triangulation across modalities such as video, interviews, journals and artefacts, and supported by ongoing reflection and iterative analysis. Rather than seeking detachment, the research acknowledges the embedded and situated nature of knowledge construction, aligning with a Transformative Activist Stance [@stetsenko_collective_2020].

Autoethnographic reflections played a supporting role in the methodological process. While not directly analysed alongside participant data, these notes informed the design of resources and facilitation strategies. Selected entries are included in Appendix 4.x as evidence of the evolving researcher-practitioner role.

### Generalisability and Replication

This study does not aim to generalise in a statistical sense. Instead, it supports transferability of insights and replication of tools and design elements. Project artefacts, including template resources, facilitation guides and open-source tools, are included in the appendices and online repositories. These were created with adaptability in mind, particularly for informal learning contexts or community-led education.

Chapter 5 extends the idea of replication through a design narrative, outlining how tools, materials and pedagogical structures evolved in response to emerging contradictions. This narrative reflects the ethos of DBR by documenting iterative and context-responsive design decisions that may be useful to others working in similar settings.

### Methodological and Practical Limitations

Several limitations shaped the scope of this research. Interview data was limited in number and timing due to logistical constraints and the emphasis on supporting live sessions. More regular or follow-up interviews might have added further depth. Similarly, while significant video data was collected, only a subset was transcribed or coded in detail, reflecting a balance between depth and breadth in analysis.

Demographic information was not formally collected, which limited opportunities to analyse learning in relation to categories such as class, neurodiversity or ethnicity. This reflected a deliberate effort to avoid over-formalising informal learning contexts, but it also constrained the interpretation of inclusion and representation.

Plans for comprehensive coding using NVivo were revised (see Stage 2). Several predefined categories were collapsed or removed, and the process became increasingly interpretive and inductive. This was in line with the study’s broader DBR orientation, where analytical strategies were refined in response to the needs and limitations of the data and context.

The methodological approach combined principles from the Helsinki School’s interpretation of formative intervention with naturalistic methods of observing practice in situ. While not all research decisions can be justified as systematic, they reflect an evolving effort to understand learning as a complex, socially situated process. The design and delivery of the learning intervention itself served as both a context and a method for exploring agency, contradiction and tool use.

The role of the researcher as facilitator, designer and analyst brought both opportunities and risks. Some decisions were intuitive, shaped by prior experience in digital learning facilitation. While this raises questions of objectivity, the Transformative Activist Stance frames such positioning not as bias but as part of a legitimate epistemological commitment. Autoethnographic materials trace the development of the intervention and the researcher’s own evolving perspective. These are included to support transparency rather than as direct data sources.

### Closing Note

This chapter has outlined the methodological framework that underpins the study, combining a staged analytical process with reflexive and design-based strategies. Emphasis has been placed on the evolving nature of the research design, and on the relationships between analysis, tool development and facilitation practice.

The next chapter builds on this foundation by tracing the co-development of the CGD&P programme over time. Using a design narrative approach [@hoadley_method_2002], Chapter 5 explores how emerging contradictions within the learning environment shaped key shifts in goals, resources and the collaborative object of the game-making intervention.

#### Why not use constructivism / constructionism

COMPRESS THIS - ALMOST DROP TOTALLY - NOTE THE GENERAL ALIGNMENT OF CONSTRUCTIONISM WITH DBR METHODS


Hay describes DBR thus "learning occurs within a context of use, learning is frequently collaborative, learning as authentic, learning as inquiry-based not transmission-based" [@hay_constructivism_2001] p. 3. Thus the broad claims are in alignment with wider socio cultural approaches.


Cobb [-@cobb_where_1994] identifies two broad schools of constructivism, one focusing more on individual cognitive processes which follows the work of Piaget and the other drawing on the academic lineage of Vygotsky which locates knowledge formation as a cultural activity.

NOTE - THERE IS IMPORTANT WORK HERE ON AUTENTICITY- and the potential tensions with agency - ie if authenticity is working a the elbows of professionals, students have less ownership over the process.  [@hay_constructivism_2001, p. 34]


**Constructionism as applied learning and design  theory**

Much of the foundational literature on game making names constructionism as a guiding theory  (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996).

Constructionism as a movement has done important work in creating design guidelines but much weaker as either an underlying theoretical or analytical framework.

Some PhD studies, many from MIT,  use it as a guiding theory [Roque]

It can be viewed as a design technique based on constructivist roots [@kynigos_constructionism]

Constructionism is also described as  a theory of learning by Noss [@noss2015reconstructing] rather than a methodology. -->



### How Research Questions Evolved - JUSTIFICATION FOR CHANING FOCUS.



was driven by

Possible themes that had potential but which were disguarded included;

- Computation thinking & systems thinking
- Aligning with Project based learning

Themes emerging include the alternation of abstract and concrete as a suggested learning journey, explored in my journal. However this seems to be explored in research on semantic waves with studies of more breadth so it did not seem a good idea to follow that thread in my thesis.

There was something about the formalisation of this process into graph form which put me off. I also realised that the frameworks that I spent a while trying to make accessible and gameful in the design, grouping and theming of their presentation, had strong similarities to concepts of abstract curriculum if explored through a semantic waves lens. Curriculum seemed too well a well trod path for a PhD thesis.  

Instead the community elements of the learning experience regained focus during the process of coding. There were particularly interesting elements of the learning environment which contributed to notable behaviours.

The area of in-depth study of learning and wider behaviours in the development of coding. Work on roles by Barron  and developed by Roque showed promise identifying helpful roles and reflecting them back to participants. Such reflection sessions were not always replicable with a general home education group or other non-formal setting.  Could this implemented in the design, in the way reflective techniques were implemented in to games. Thus making it more playful/ gameful.
