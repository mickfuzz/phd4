# Methodology

## Introduction

This chapter sets out the methodological approach underpinning this study, building directly from the theoretical commitments explored in Chapter 3. Drawing on the principles of activity theory  and design-based research (DBR), this research was designed as an iterative, situated process embedded in a real-world, non-formal learning environment. Rather than applying a fixed method to a controlled setting, the study developed responsively, shaped by the complex interplay of context, participant input, and pedagogical experimentation.

Chapter 3 introduced the conceptual foundations shaping this approach: learning as socially and historically situated, agency as emergent and distributed, and design as a driver of transformation. These principles are here translated into methodological commitments, especially a focus on mutuality with participants, flexibility in design, and responsiveness to the evolving dynamics of the setting. The chapter begins by establishing the scope of the research as qualitative, general, and exploratory. It then discusses the authenticity of the context, the significance of my dual role as researcher-facilitator, and the rationale for a method that privileges a rich approach to detail. Following this, the chapter details how the project was delivered in practice, including the recruitment process, session formats, and the diverse forms of data collected such as journal entries, artefacts, video and screen recordings.

The analytical process developed over three broad stages. In the early phase, journal reflections, interviews and preliminary video reviews helped surface initial patterns and contradictions. This was followed by a deeper exploratory phase of theme clustering and iterative coding, including attempts at both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The final stage involved selecting key vignettes for closer analysis, integrating participant voices and triangulating across data sources to refine conceptual insights into learner agency, tool use, and learning processes. The chapter concludes with reflections on ethical considerations, validity  of the data analysis, returning to the methodological frameworks of activity theory and DBR, considering how this study both draws from and contributes to those evolving traditions. At this stage the limitations of the thesis are also examined.


<!-- As previously explored, the research questions invite a broad spectrum of analysis - cultural and social factors. -->
<!-- The depth justifies smaller data size and depth of analysis. -->
### Defining Scope and Approach

This chapter outlines a methodological approach grounded in the general principles of formative interventions and design-based research (DBR). To do this it will  draw on techniques from those disciplines including specifically social design-based experiments (SDBE) and design-based implementation research (DBIR) [@penuel_design-based_2021].

While the previous chapters have established the theoretical framework and research questions, this chapter connects those questions more directly to methods. To provide a an overview to ground the reader, an outline how the research questions informed data collection, analysis, and theoretical framing follows:

**RQ1**: *What contradictions emerged during participation in CGD&P activities, and how were they addressed via an innovative pedagogy?*  
Data were drawn from video observations, participant and practitioner interviews, facilitator reflections, and gameplay interactions. These were analysed through systemic tension mapping and activity system analysis, using cultural-historical activity theory to frame contradictions as drivers of expansive transformation.

**RQ2**: *How can a collection of game design patterns support CGD&P, particularly regarding abstract and concrete dimensions of existing pedagogies?*  
Data included gameplay documentation, screen capture analysis, and participant reflections on pattern use. Thematic analysis focused on mediation through design patterns and how these related to shifts in learning activity. Framing drew on the mediational lens of CHAT and the pedagogical scaffolding emphasis of DBR.

**RQ3**: *How do learner agency and game-maker identity develop within CGD&P communities of practice, and what pedagogical strategies best support this evolution across diverse learning contexts?*  
A longitudinal dataset spanning phases of community interactions and design development, interviews, and field notes was analysed through thematic clustering, relational mapping, and narrative analysis. This was informed by DBRâs emphasis on iterative refinement and 3GATâs view of expansive learning in situated activity.

### A Qualitative, General, and Exploratory Approach

This study is qualitative, general, and exploratory in nature, shaped by DBR and CHAT. It adopts an iterative, context-sensitive approach to understanding learning environments in CGD&P, avoiding rigid experimental constraints. In terms of educational objectives, the goal is to generate situated knowledge that can inform responsive educational practices rather than to produce more universally generalisable outcomes [@cobb_design_2003]. However, the methodology of this research also seeks to reveal pedagogical tensions, contradictions, and shifts in learner agency and develop understandings which have potential for a broader application.

Rather than starting with fixed aims, the inquiry evolved through mutual engagement with participants and an openness to emergent goals. This orientation is justified both by the nature of the setting (non-formal, collaborative, and often resistant to conventional evaluation [CITAION]) and by the desire to avoid prematurely deciding on what kinds of pedagogical or methodological innovations might arise. While certain features remained consistent throughout, the process was fundamentally shaped by what unfolded during iterative cycles of engagement.

<!-- ### Iterative Development with Participant Input -->

Pedagogical elements of the research design were  co-developed through collaboration with young learners, their families, and undergraduate student helpers. Over time, iterative design phases were informed by participant feedback, emergent needs, and reflection on practice. This collaborative shaping of both tools and pedagogy reflects established principles in participatory research [@iversen_computational_2018-1; @iivari_critical_2017], DBR [@barab_design-based_2004], and formative interventions [@cole_fifth_2006; @blunden_formative_2023].

Participant input took multiple forms: direct feedback in interviews and structured activities, observations of gameplay and design behaviour, and artefacts produced in workshops. The ongoing trialling and adjustment of software environments, templates, and resources took place over an extended period and, involved undergraduate trainees, colleagues, and parent volunteers. These iterative changes are documented throughout the study and explored further in Chapters 5 to 7.

Bakker offers guidance in the formulation of research questions in DBR studies which are relevant to this thesis [@bakker_design_2018]. He promotes HOW and WHAT CONSIDERATIONS formulation of question to be represent the exploratory nature of DBR approaches and to increase the possibility of possible generalisation without over promising in terms of projecting beyond the embedded nature of the findings as embedded in the context of the study.

### Utility, Holistic Data and  Rich Descriptions  

This study provide _thick_, descriptive accounts of learning in CGD&P across multiple levels of activity [@maxwell_qualitative_2013]. Informed by Rogoffâs [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of analysis in communities of learners, data collection included both individual and group-level video capture, journal notes, screen recordings, and design artefacts. These layered sources enabled analysis of how learning processes unfolded across time, tools, and interactions. This approach also brought challenges, particularly in managing and interpreting complex video data, which are discussed later in this chapter.

The commitment to rich description is not just analytical rigour but also driven by the purpose of sharing of pedagogical practice to fellow practitioners. Following Ann Brownâs original call for design experiments to align with the needs of real-world learning contexts [@brown_design_1992], and later work by Bakker and Penuel, for utility to be at the heart of the DBR process, this research prioritises design decisions that allow for replicability in both academic and diverse educational contexts.

Applied to software, tools should be replicable within the target audience of informal settings which may have restricted budget.  FLOSS or freely available tools were used wherever feasible, following software sustainability principles [@crouch_software_2013], and ensuring that both the pedagogical design and research methodology can be adopted or adapted by others [@bonneel_code_2020].

### Authentic and Ecological Orientation

To produce findings are contextually valid and socially relevant, pedagogical interventions too place within a real-world CGD&P learning programme in a non-formal educational context shaped by home education practices, local community logistics, and varied participant demographics. This ecological embeddedness shaped recruitment, session scheduling, and the kinds of learning interactions that were possible (covered in a following section). These factors also brought an authenticity that aligns with ecosystem models of learning design [@barnett_ecosystem_2019]  where value is created through contextually relevant pedagogical engagement.

### ResearcherâFacilitator Dual Role

My role as both researcher and facilitator was central to the methodological design. Each data collection session was also a workshop, planned and adapted to meet the varied needs of participants. While this dual role introduced challenges such as balancing intervention with observation and recognising positionality, it also provided opportunities for sustained engagement, flexible design, and a clearer view of pedagogical evolution in action.

As explored in Fifth Dimension work by Cole and others, this researcher-practitioner stance invites critical reflection on the ethics, logistics, and value of practice-based inquiry. Throughout the process, I aimed to recognise and support emergent participant practices, using tools and scaffolds that could adapt dynamically. These choices are revisited across the following findings chapters, which trace how participants responded to, reshaped, and extended the learning environment.


## previous bits

This study is qualitative, general, and exploratory in nature, guided by design based research (DBR) and cultural historical activity theory (CHAT). By prioritising iterative, context-sensitive inquiry, it investigates learning environments in CGD&P without imposing rigid experimental constraints. The methodology is designed to capture contradictions, pedagogical tensions, and learner agency, using qualitative analysis to develop inclusive and adaptive pedagogies. Findings aim to enhance educational practices, rather than produce universally generalisable conclusions.

I worked with young learners, local families and undergraduate student helpers to co-create a game making design via iterative phases of rapidly evolving interventions. The value of participant input to intervention-based research in the domain of technology use is well explored via participatory research  [@iversen_computational_2018-1; @iivari_critical_2017], design-based approaches [@papavlasopoulou_exploring_2019; @barab_design-based_2004] and formative interventions [@cole_fifth_2006; @blunden_formative_2023]. In line with these research perspectives, the development of the tools and processes used by participants in this study emerged in response to my analysis of participant experience and their direct feedback.

**Guiding technical rationale guiding software use**

A guiding principle here is to use an ideally FLOSS toolset or if not practical to use non-specialist software available within or outside the university and free or low cost. This in line with the principle of software sustainability principles [@crouch_software_2013] in general, and in particular to allow the replicability of research not only by fellow researchers but by practitioners [@bonneel_code_2020]. Thus applying to two dimensions of replication of research methodology here, that of research and facilitation of project sessions.

### pb - Authentic and ecological nature of research

The importance of context, historicity and cultural factors are particularly relevant for this intervention in a non-formal educational context with diverse stakeholder.

This study, guided by DBR and CHAT frameworks,  embraces an authentic and ecological approach to research.





### pb - Dual Role research and facilitator and resulting challenges and opportunities

Driven by my dual role as a researcher and learning facilitator the process described here incorporates both research methodology and an overall structure of the evolving learning design.

My role as a facilitator included recognising and supporting the emergence of a repertoire of varied emergent practices in the responses of participants, and then to support these practices with suitable tools and resources. In this way, I support participants to build agency in their transformation of learning process. The following three chapters of research findings in part describe these transformations and emerging repetoires in more detail.

While my dual role presented challenges, such as balancing intervention with observation and mitigating positionality biases, it also created opportunities for deep engagement and pedagogical innovation. This dual role enables the exploration of tensions and contradictions in CGD&P while ensuring that pedagogical interventions evolve dynamically alongside participant needs.

Work on bias, or needs of the research process, addressed particularly by Cole in 5thD work.

TAS relevant, activist stance.

Each data gathering session was also a 2 hour workshop with varied participants with diverse learning needs requiring planning and delivery.


## Data collection within project delivery phases

This section addresses both the phases of delivery of the game making programme to families and the data collection that occurred at each phase.

As the next chapter outlines the evolution of the learning intervention as a design narrative, discussion of learning design will be brief here and concerned with overall methodology of collection and analysis.

A summary of the delivery phases and one key development period are outlined in a graphical representation below in Fig 4.x. to help situate the following descriptions and discussion.

### Recruitment and data on participants

<!-- Home education groups operate in varied ways, and in my experience are characterised by loose ties rather than strong formal bonds. -->

In early 2016 I had carried out an exploratory workshop with home educators to explore future partnerships with the enrichment programme of the Faculty of Education [^el]. The process of recruiting was facilitated by the running of on going one off workshops which were similar in scope via the EdLab funologists strand of playful technology project. Specifically, half term events at Manchester Libraries and in the University and at Coder Dojo week end events.

This work meant I was in regular contact with some home educators and posting opportunities on their forum contributed to an ongoing relationship within the three existing home education communications networks used to share information and experiences [he]. To recruit participant I circulated a simple text to participants asking them to get in touch via email. When participants got in touch I emailed adults the relevant participation sheet and asked them to confirm their interest.

This process is covered in the ethics later in this chapter below.

#### On mutuality of design and practicalities of  collection during phases

APPENDIX LINK OUT

The process of creating resources also occurred in phases which had input from participants.

**Types of input by Participants**



This an iterative approach is evident in the evolution of the learning design and resources. For example, the trialling of the coding environment and starting templated occurred over and extended period and with input and concrete additions from parent volunteers, graduate trainee-teacher students, undergraduate students helpers University colleagues and with more indirect ongoing feedback from participating young people and their guardians. Input took varied forms.

Direct input was through help requests made by participants and feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.


Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews.

Indirect input was also at play in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants.

I had used Mozilla's Thimble code playground tool in earlier work teaching javascript, a snapshot of which is available as PGCE dissertation [@chesterman_webmaking_2015].

D2 - One-off workshops at Mozilla, Feral Vector and Manchester libraries events and to PGCE computer students helped focus and the creation of a game template and supporting resources. -->


<!--
P2, A game making course of 6 weeks. The template and resources created D2 were used as a starting point but still under rapid development based on informal participant feedback and my journal reflections.

Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.

P3 used the same toolset as P2 however in addition, drew on my previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department [@caldwell_drama_2019] to create a simple drama process to give an external motivation and narrative to the creation of games using for a fictional audience of visiting aliens. The participant activity of these stages and tensions between system elements are discussed in detail in the remainder of this chapter and in following chapters.


The last iterations of the learning design adopted the MakeCode Arcade tool as a new game authoring tool [mc].
I adapted and advanced resources with an aim that they could be used within secondary classrooms to support computing curriculum.
The facilitation techniques and approach were adapted from those of P2 to facilitate the use of the block coding language . Tool use at this stage is also explored in a chapter in a collection on K-12 computing education [@chesterman_game_2023]. -->

### Data collection of journal notes and facilitation artefacts

Auto-ethnographic data collection

I used journal notes extensively in a notebook format and in electronic format within chronologically categorised word processing documents. These notes involved a mix of session planning, resource planning, immediate reflections on sessions, and notes on links with existing literature.

In addition, I also carefully collected the session resources themselves in terms of the tools used and supporting documentation and activities.

The games and artefacts themselves also are data of a sort.

**Rationale**


Principle of double stimulation, and adoption of tools for different purposes than originally intended.

Allowing movement, and mutuality,

link to 5thD and other studies guided by

Also introduce the process of Chapter 5 design narrative

**Practicalities and Challenges**

_Journal data formats_

- Book Journal pages
- Digital journal entries directly in response to teaching sessions
- Other subject specific journal notes.



**A challenge of data collection of artefacts**

In terms of the sustainability of the data collected. This was tested in the final stages of writing when the site on which the games and images were stored glitch.com announced it would stop hosting in July 2025. The data was migrated by downloading html, javascript, css and image files as a bulk download and reuploading to a git repository [gm].

Projects created in piskel were lost, but exported data remains.

_game data_

The process of keeping game data created within  online and available is tricky.
However, as files were HTML, js and css. Offline archives were created for later use. Helpful in case of Thimble as the project was discontinued.

WRONG!
As of the time of writing Glitch.com, the replacement remains. A selection of games created remain here [gg].



### Video data collection via 360 and screen capture

**Summary**

Screen capture is a process which allows the recording of data of what is happening on the screen of computers. It optionally allows the audio being played

I chose the software flashback pro primarily as it was installed on and available at low cost on home computers. No FLOSS equivalent was available. Flashback saves data in a format. This include audio, video screen capture, learner keystrokes, mouse movements and optionally one or more webcams. I decided not to record on webcams for the following reasons:

- intrusive feel - having the webcam on and the resulting red light on the screen, I felt was less conducive to feeling comfortable than one 360 camera in the middle of the room.
- less resources - recording webcam on the laptop
- reduced video file size of final data file
- less complexity when processing data -

It not possible to code the natively created files directly. Thus need to be converted to mp4 to import into coding software like Nvivo. In this process the keyboard and mouse data is lost.

**Rationale**

Video "rich" data collections

Environmental - i.e. in situ - and as a form of activity that fit within the pattern of home ed families existing activities.

### Practicalities of data collection and processing

While the rich set of data invites the cross referencing of the many sources, it also presents challenge on how to deal effectively with the large amounts of data being gathered. The use of a 360 camera reduces the amount of live video footage of interactions needed. Instead of multiple cameras pointed in different directions to capture participant interaction, participants are arranged in a square pointing inwards towards a central 360 degree camera.

Check viability of data at each stage of processing and movement.

<!-- I use a software sustainability approach also influenced by a personal modification of permaculture computing ideas and ideas of free software and open document approaches. The very nature of working with video is time consuming. -->

- Is batch processing of files possible?
- It it a cross platform approach - in particular can I use it on debian based linux systems?

I also take a more practical approach which takes into account working with peers and that such advocacy is not a core part of my job or this research.

#### 360 Video Processing


The processing of video and audio data of both captured screens and 360 video data and high quality audio data involved several stages yielding advantages in capturing the gestures and facial expressions of potentially all participants in one recording. It does however present challenges. While this merits further exploration a brief summary of challenges is presented here.

The process involves large video files that are easily corrupted in transfer. While the files are split into 8 minute segments  but also can be confusing
- time navigation - also confusing - sometimes put up on the screen - but inconsistently
- moving and keeping a track of data from week to week and over years is complex.
- processing data requires special software - from samsung
- viewing data on a normal vlc player - needs extra processing using spatial media

<!-- Tech details are logged here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6m20wehYkTeevj9QucpzKCR4NioELndg2rZeLWFK-c/edit# -->


This whole process is so demanding in terms of careful file management. Making me create a linux command line toolbox which is included as a technical appendix.

<!-- Thus original files have been retained in order to cross reference that data if it is useful. It also presents other options for analysis which are similar to much more in depth analysis of HCI research of professional set ups. While this is beyond the remit of this study, certain uses do present themselves strongly for future investigation. Particularly the study of such data to identify common mistakes or frustrations when interacting with the user interface. Such misconceptions could be addressed in direct teaching at the start of the next session. -->

## Data analysis process

The analysis was structured in three stages to reflect the evolving relationship between the data and the research questions. This staged approach allowed for an iterative process: beginning with exploratory review, progressing through thematic refinement and methodological adjustment, and concluding with interpretive consolidation. Each stage responded to new insights and practical constraints, and together they represent a strategy for understanding how learning, agency, and contradiction played out within the CGD&P interventions.

Due to the exploratory nature of the research and the openness to emergent directions, the analysis process evolved iteratively across multiple stages. For the purposes of clarity, this process is presented in three simplified stages that reflect broad shifts in focus and method. Each stage marks a move toward greater granularity, using different analytical strategies suited to the emerging needs of the study. This structure also proved particularly useful in managing the large volume of video and screen capture data generated during the CGD&P sessions.

### Stage 1 - Exploratory analysis

Stage 1 served as a exploratory review of the dataset to assess data quality, relevance, and initial themes. This included reviewing researcher journals, practitioner interviews, and preliminary video footage to develop a sense of the emerging pedagogical and methodological issues. The goal was to understand the types of contradictions and learning behaviours present, and to inform the next steps for more focused analysis. This phase aimed to determine which datasets merited deeper analysis and refine the methodological processes for subsequent analytical stages, aligning with approaches of iterative refinement in DBR [@bikner-ahsbahs_introduction_2015-1].

The process was initially driven by the need to produce a summary of the facilitation process and to surface contextual tensions for a book chapter [@chesterman_game_2023], as well as to contribute to a mapping of learning dimensions developed during the D3 phase for online resource design [lm]. Journal analysis provided a foundational perspective on facilitation and early thematic tensions. Given the breadth of journal data, a comprehensive thematic analysis and exhaustive coding was impractical; instead, insights were triangulated with findings from the literature review to expose key themes and contradictions in the evolving pedagogy. Rogoffâs [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of sociocultural activity were particularly useful here, allowing reflections on facilitation to be categorised across personal, interpersonal, and institutional dimensions, a technique further refined by Morcom [-@morcom_scaffolding_2014]. Alongside journal entries, evolving teaching resources, participant-created games, and assets  were examined to provide insight into how learners engaged with design elements, navigated  constraints, and appropriated resources for their own purposes. The use of these materials  informed subsequent iterations of facilitation and resource development, and contributed to  the emergent facilitation strategy.

Practitioner interviews were used alongside journal reflections to identify key pedagogical concerns, barriers to participation, and evolving priorities within the learning design. Four extended interviews (averaging 90 minutes each) were conducted with professionals and collaborators from overlapping fields. The semi-structured format allowed for responsive dialogue, helping to surface themes such as learner identity, creative constraint, scaffolding strategies, and the design tensions in non-formal learning contexts. Themes included: agency as a focus, which emerged from Dave Pottsâ reflections on the value of surfacing and supporting participantsâ own interests in digital making; the value and tensions surrounding competition in non-formal settings, raised by Matt Curringa; the helping roles played by parents in young people's engagement with technology, highlighted by Saskia Leggett; and the affordances of online toolkits and game mechanics as mediational strategies, discussed by James Clegg. These interviews also helped focus subsequent cycles of video analysis by informing early coding directions and refinement of the research questions.

Finally, video data was explored through a broad review of selected screen capture and 360-degree recordings from P2, P3, and P4. This initial dip into the video archive was used to assess both the quality and analytic potential of the recordings. Observations were recorded using a spreadsheet format and structured around Rogoffâs [@rogoff_observing_1995] three-plane framework. This approach provided an initial sense of the rhythms of sessions, the emergence of roles, and the unfolding of mediational practices. At this stage, full transcription was not attempted; instead, time-stamped observations helped determine which sessions might warrant deeper analysis in subsequent stages.

This first stage set the foundation for the later interpretive work by clarifying the practical constraints of the data, surfacing early thematic directions, and testing the viability of a multi-source, iterative approach.



### Stage 2 â Thematic Refinement

The second stage of analysis began with the intention of developing a structured coding schema that could support both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Inspired by a desire to systematically compare themes across video data, interviews, and journals, the original plan involved using NVivo (a qualitative-first data analysis software that also supports mixed-methods queries) to apply a consistent thematic structure, combining insights from the literature, practitioner interviews, and preliminary analysis. NVivo allows researchers to apply codes across datasets and run queries, for example to examine how much time participants spent on specific tasks or how often particular behaviours occurred.

However, as the coding process began, a number of challenges arose. Technically, NVivo struggled to handle the extended screen and 360-degree video files smoothly. Syncing multiple video streams, switching between screen capture and wide-view footage, and viewing timestamps simultaneously became cumbersome. At one point, a workaround using VLC Player allowed for dual playback, and time-coded observations were trialled using five-minute transcription segments imported into Word and then into NVivo. But even this solution remained resource-intensive and prone to breakdown. The complexity of comparing behaviours across screen and 360 recordings also made queries and coding comparisons inconsistent or difficult to manage.

These frustrations coincided with more conceptual questions. It became clear that applying a fixed coding frame would risk obscuring key features of the learning environment, particularly the emergent, improvisational, and tool-mediated aspects of learner agency. Some candidate codes, such as computational thinking, were deprioritised due to either their conceptual overlap with existing literature or a lack of richness in the CGD&P data. Other categories, such as game design stages, became harder to apply consistently across groups and sessions. A rigid schema, in this case, risked flattening what was most interesting: the improvised use of resources, peer scaffolding, and negotiation of meaning in action.

The shift from planned coding to a more interpretive, emergent strategy was not abrupt; it evolved through repeated attempts to organise, code, and revisit earlier transcripts. The use of Rogoffâs three planes of analysis (personal, interpersonal, and cultural) became increasingly helpful as a scaffolding framework. Instead of developing a strict taxonomy, the process moved towards memoing, sketching, and thematically clustering insights using Word documents. These techniques allowed a more flexible and responsive mode of interpretation that could adjust to the complexity of participant behaviour, tool use, and social interaction.

To manage the scope of analysis, ten sessions were selected for deeper review. Criteria included clarity of audio and visuals, richness of peer and facilitator interaction, and representation of different phases of the intervention. In practice, most of the analysis focused on data from phases P2 and P3, as these contained the richest examples of interaction. One session from the end of P2, in particular, stood out due to the complexity of collaboration and the variety of participant roles observed. Transcripts were created in five-minute intervals, pairing 360-degree footage with screen recordings. These were not fully coded line-by-line, but were annotated descriptively with researcher memos noting tensions, tool use, gestures, and participant roles. In some cases, episodes were flagged for deeper treatment in later vignette analysis.

A sample spreadsheet of analysis structured using Rogoffâs three planes is included in the appendix, along with a word-processed document representing one screen capture recording. In this context, the term refers to a segment of recorded participant activity captured via screen recording, typically involving one learner or a pair working at a laptop during a broader workshop session.

While NVivo was initially used to trial some of this coding process, its limitations ultimately led to the adoption of Word-based transcription and thematic logging. This shift reflected a broader methodological commitment: staying close to the activity as it unfolded, rather than forcing it into predefined analytic categories. The process of trying, adapting, and discarding coding strategies also mirrored the studyâs broader design ethos, where tools and structures evolved in response to emergent practice instead of being imposed from above.

As new patterns emerged, such as the significance of game design patterns in shaping learner trajectories or the role of peers and parents in scaffolding complex actions, the original research questions were refined. This phase helped surface key areas for Stage 3, including clusters of agency, mediational strategies, and participant repertoires. It also clarified which transcripts and artefacts were most generative for deep, vignette-style interpretation. By the end of this stage, the goal had shifted decisively away from quantifying learning behaviours and toward richly describing how learners appropriated tools and reshaped their participation. What began as a trial of software and schema evolved into a process of conceptual grounding through situated observation and practical compromise.


### Stage 3 â Interpretive Consolidation

The third and final stage of analysis focused on consolidating insights through detailed, interpretive work. Building on the broad mapping of Stage 1 and the thematic refinement of Stage 2, this phase returned to key segments of data selected for their richness, complexity, and relevance to the evolving research questions. The goal was to generate grounded, contextualised understandings of learner agency, design mediation, and pedagogical interaction through the construction of vignettes.

This stage centred on four key vignettes drawn from screen capture and 360-degree video recordings. These were chosen for their representation of diverse learner roles, visible design decision-making, and interactional dynamics. Full transcriptions were produced for these segments, integrating verbal dialogue, on-screen activity, and embodied communication such as gestures and movement within the learning space. Viewing the 360 footage alongside the screen capture recordings proved essential in several cases, especially where participants referenced their physical environment or used gesture to support peer explanation.

These vignettes were not designed to be representative in a statistical sense, but to offer textured accounts of how specific learners or pairs navigated their tools, peers, and task structures. Each vignette was treated as a situated episode that could illuminate broader pedagogical questions, including how learners asserted agency, interpreted guidance, or adapted resources. Where possible, these micro-analyses were triangulated with post-session interview data, artefacts (such as games or design notes), and reflective journal entries made immediately after facilitation.

One focus during this stage was to examine the ways game design patterns (GDPs) operated as mediational tools. A coding spreadsheet, developed during Stage 2, was extended to cluster GDP use across planes of activity (individual, interpersonal, and cultural). Patterns of adaptation and reinterpretation were particularly salient, as learners often modified a patternâs purpose or linked it to emergent gameplay goals. These shifts were interpreted through a CHAT lens as evidence of agency enacted through tool transformation and appropriation.

In parallel, the concept of learner agency was refined through a return to participant action across different learning contexts. This included recognition of how agency was distributed over time, scaffolded by peers and parents, and shaped by opportunities to explore, remix, and perform learning in varied modes. Gestural and embodied data played a key role here, with several vignettes including analysis of how learners moved around the room, negotiated turn-taking, or used physical props alongside digital tools. One vignette in particular was prompted by feedback from Ricardo Nemirovsky, who encouraged a more deliberate integration of gesture analysis.

This interpretive work aimed to clarify not only how the learning environment supported certain forms of agency and design fluency, but also what constraints remained. In some vignettes, learners struggled to access tools or articulate their ideas, prompting reflections on equity, inclusion, and the role of facilitation. These observations informed both the final conceptual model (developed in Chapter 7) and ongoing questions about how pedagogical environments can be designed to support participation across multiple modes and identities.

By the end of this stage, the analysis had shifted from mapping general trends to closely engaging with specific examples that embodied tensions and possibilities within the CGD&P project. These vignettes became the foundation for articulating the studyâs contributions to both theory and practice.

In practice all applicants were accommodated as the gender and ethnicity balance was broadly representative of the home education groups in the local area.

Given the involvement of three different participant groups of university students, parents, and children, I adapted assent forms, participant information sheets and processes to requirements of each group. For parents, a detailed assent form explained the studyâs purpose, how data from children would be collected and managed, and the rights of parents, including their ability to withdraw themselves and their child at any time. For children, a simplified assent form was created using age-appropriate language. This form explained the study in simple terms, emphasising that participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw at any time without negative consequences. Written assent from the children was obtained as part of an informal discussion involving both children and parents. University students were also provided with a assent form explaining the studyâs purpose, their rights (including voluntary participation and the right to withdraw without consequence), and data usage. They were given the opportunity to review the form and ask questions before providing written consent.

To ensure respect for the autonomy of all participants, particularly children, alternative activities were offered as part of the recruitment process for those who did not wish to participate in the study. This was important in settings where families may have felt a pressure to take part in research in order to benefit from the social or educational opportunities.  

It was not possible to anonymise video, audio recordings at the point of collection, however is has been anonymised in the process of data analysis through the use of pseudonyms.  The raw video data and additional data from the project has been stored on a password protected external computer drive, separate from the research data. Only the lead researcher had direct access although the ethics approval process gave project supervisors may be given access on request. I took care to not allow any personal data into the public realm as part of the research on analysis process.

As the study involved children additional safeguards were in place. All university students assisting with the study, as well as myself as the primary facilitator, had undergone Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks as part of the EdLab studies programme. Activities involving children were conducted under the supervision of a parent or guardian, who could withdraw the child from the study at any time. Children were reminded, in terms they could understand, that they could opt out at any time.

#### Data validity, reliability

<!-- **and decisions of what to not analyse** -->

The issues addressed in this section relate not only to the guidance methodology receives from the theoretical underpinnings explored in the last chapter but also the concerns of the driving researcher questions.

Issues of reliability and validity in research are significantly complicated when viewed through a post-objectivist critical stance, as exemplified in the previous chapter by Stetsenko's transformative activist stance, which challenges positivist paradigms of research as a neutral endeavour in terms of values of those undertaking it [@stetsenko2014transfromative]. While, a full investigation of the Stetsenko and other's rejection of an objectivist research approach is beyond the remit of this chapter, it supports the inclusion of my own auto-ethnographic journal as a valid source of data.


In general terms data validity refers to match between the findings of the study and what is happening in in practice.  Turning to a more established exploration of data validity,  Bakker's [-@bakker_design_2018, p.88] exploration of the issues of data validity in DBR is well suited to the diverse data gathering methods of this study.

<!-- While Bakker notes need for different approaches for qualitative approaches  [@lincoln1985naturalistic] - he uses conventional terms of validity and reliability -= rather than specialist terms of Lincoln and Grub  -->


The strategies in this study are broadly, data triangulation, the use of rich descriptions, and a process of checking your interpretations of activities with participants (member checking)


**Use of rich descriptions**

Hoadley calls for rich descriptions of the learning design, a process which is applied in this thesis as a design narrative in Chapter 5.

Similarly, rich descriptions of the interactions of participants with the learning design, their own project creations and each other are included in the data results in small extracts, or where appropriate more extended vignettes. These allow for a fuller exploration of the learning processes in a richer context. Some details of interaction are needed to give other scholars and practitioners a full picture of interactions. The descriptions of facial reactions or body language in the vignette descriptions serve this end.


**Data triangulation**
<!-- Draw on other chapters to represent overcoming of weaknesses of design-based approach. -->

Having a wide based on data allowed data triangulation at the analysis stage. When

One form of triangulation is member checking where participants are asked to confirm and share information which supplement video data.

As an example, in interview data a participant who expressed frustration in the moment about a form of disruptive practice of another participant, was able to place that frustration in context.


### Generalisation of Research


#### Data Replicability

The elements of the design are online and included in appendices.

This study faces an issue of being culturally embodies, thus think descriptions of context are needed here [@hoadley_creating_2002].

The final chapter addresses the need to replicate this study in different contexts and the challenges involved in replicating the spontaneous emergent elements of specifics of this study.

As such chapter four can be conceptualised as a design narrative (see [@hoadley_creating_2002]) to address the common deficit of detail of the designed product and process. "the usual study presents a technology fully formed as if it had risen from the oceans like Venus herself"

" Would that all interventional research included this kind of rich description of the âtreatmentâ so that one might infer whether the results were applicable elsewhere."

#### Generalisation of Research


Generalisation is one of the guiding principles of DBR. While results are intertwined with context, designs should be assessed for generalisation to other settings.

Explore this in more detail - draw out a debate on how situated learning in this context - and wider debate is.

- More than one iteration.
- In different settings
- Using different with different software

This is potentially complex to describe but worth it if wanting to talk about generalisation.

NOTE - This could be dropped or picked up again in the limitations section

The process of exploring this guided the development of the research questions.

### Limitations of interview and video data

The choice of the videos to code more fully is rather skewed towards finding interesting data. Thus it may not be fully representative of the experience of all participants.

Choosing in a different way - around less interaction - would expose more barriers to participation to game making using the 3M model.

<!-- For example in
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQf0OvKs07tY-VKDnB7K94F_kHVW7M1Vz0NlLm1t1WE/edit
Imagining a constructionist game-based pedagogical model: Using tabletop role-playing game creation to enhance literature education in high school English classes -->

Only suitable pairs were chosen. This removes a lot of validity from any generalisation of claims that could be made.

Breaking of data into 5 min sections is practical but does not allow for some of the finer interactions and changes of behaviour to be accurately coded.  There may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granular detail.

<!-- The game elements / design patterns categories which are presented are created as a design guide rather than on exact principles.
It is possible to code drilling down into another level. This might yield more results. -->

In summary, the coding process is more valuable as a tool to allow more qualitative reflection and analysis rather than a quantitative process as attempted above.

To make a quantitative approach work better X,Y and Z would need to be in place which was not suitable for this study because of A and B.


<!-- How much emphasis to place on the Thematic Analysis is questionable. The process served to help answer the research questions in general way as an additional interpretive tools to aid researcher reflection and to help get close to the data. -->

<!-- I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies [@derry_conducting_2010]. I use a variant of discourse analysis to explore interactions of participants captured on video recordings. Mercer and colleagues identify discourse analysis as a loose associations of methods to support linguistic analysis of interactions to identify emergent patterns [@mercer_methods_2004]. While a common pattern in classroom interactions is that of IRF, initiation (teacher), response (student) and follow up (teacher) [@sinclair_towards_1975] , the inherent assumption that a teacher will be leading an activity will not consistently be appropriate for my study; although at times a parent may take this role. Other discourse analysis frameworks that take a sociocultural approach [@lyle_investigation_1993; @phillips_beyond_1985], and specifically those from project focused studies [@hmelo-silver_facilitating_2008; @moje_maestro_2001] allow more detailed treatment of the incorporation of tools and cultural artefacts into a collective discourse. -->

<!-- To avoid distraction from AT as my principle analytical framework I am in agreement with Wells (1999, p. 172) who proposes the use of AT's concepts to situate 'spoken discourse \... as one, but only one, of the semiotic tools that participants use to achieve the goals of action'. Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals. -->

#### Limits of interview data_

The chief limit is the lack of repeated and regular interview data.

The reason are mostly practical, fitting in additional interviews with families withing a busy schedule.

It was depriorisited and less interviews were conducted than anticipated, and not as regularly.

This reduces factors of reliability as it reduces possibilities for

And prioritising more hands on work which was perceived as more benefitial and welcome by myself.




## Discussion and limitations



### How does this methodology relate to existing models of Change Laboratory & DBR and what does that add potentially

Keep this brief.

The smaller time frame of iterations, and more direct intervention in the ongoing / leading activity distiguishes this approach from a Change Laboratory. However, the analysis of tensions, and thus double stimulation to provoke evolutions of agency are alike.



### Potential of this approach

NOTE - WHAT KIND OF DISCUSSION WOULD BE NEEDED HERE?
A RETURN TO POSSIBLE BARRIERS THAT THE METHODOLOGY AIMS TO OVER COME



#### Recap on the emergent and mutual nature of the design and research process


The experimental team consisted of home educating partents, young people families, students. All inputted into subsequent iterations of the game making program both directly and indirectly.

The presence of parents in particulary, adds significant opportunities. I propose that this informal and exploratory setting with the participation of engaged parents, young people and their access to family learning dynamics and wider expertise provides potentially fertile ground in the generation of resources and domain practices. I explore the potential of this theme in more detail in the conclusion of this thesis.  

## Limitations of overall methodology

Address limitations of methodology and RQs here so that I don't have to in the conclusion.

- Ethnicity


Denner et al. [-@denner_does_2019]  identified several general points of limitation in studies within their review of CGD&P specifically.
FIND LIST -  demographics, pedagogy, etc  

This study does not aim to address all of these limitations. Indeed it shares many of them.

Thus while limitation are acknowledged, they are justified by the exploratory nature of this study. Possibilities for follow up research to address these limitations are discussed in the concluding Chapter 8.

**Limitation of space to describe technical decisions**
Fuller technical descriptions of the tools and supporting resources used at each stage are beyond the scope of those questions and the limits of the structure of this thesis, fuller technical descriptions to and links to the online resources created are available as appendix 4.x.

#### Limitation of demographics of participants.

In gathering data, I adapted a process from partnership work with more experiences professors.

This did not gather details of demographics. Thus no data was gathered on the age of participants, any details of specific learning difficulties.
- Details of neuro-diversity

While this was an oversight, but it also aligns with the aims of this study which are exploratory and investigate potential rather than making claims of efficacy and generalisability. This is explored in a later section.


## Chapter conclusion and link

The next chapter focuses in more depth of the mutual evolution of the learning design in a way which aligns with the design narative technique of DBR (hoadley? - find others!)

In line the ethos of formative interventions and DBR this chapter has outlined a methodology which aknowledges the roles of my own input as a scholar/activist and that of participants. The process of working with participant input to the design of the learning intervention served several functions including: access to novel technical approaches proposed by parents and university volunteers; the surfacing of systemic conflicts hidden from my initial perception stemming from my pre-conceptions; observation of participant conflicts spurred the introduction of new tools to support development; and parental proficiency in adapting the learning environment to supporting their children leading to community-wide innovations in practice.

This chapter has described a hybrid approach based on the principles of the Helsinki school's interpretation of  formative intervention, supplemented by naturalistic research methods involving gathering data in-situ to find and describe emerging patterns of behaviour via thick decriptions and the more rapid iterations into the working practices common in DBR in the learning sciences and HCI approaches.


My role as a participant facilitator, designer and researcher presents some challenges which this chapter has addressed. While some decisions were to an extent intuative or reflexive based on my past experiences as a facilation of group productive processes involving technology, and for some this would present issues of validity, the process is in line with a TAS approach.  While my auto-ethnographic notes are too extensive to effectively bring into the data analysis process, they chart the complex and iterative process of refining this reflection into learning and teaching resources. Several samples of journal entries are offered as evidence of this process in Appendix. 4.x

LINK

While the phases and overall structure of the learning design have been presented here, the following chapter, using the a technique of design narrative, explores the evolving areas of contradictions that drive these changes to the evolvling and expanding object of the group game making process.




<!-- Barab and Squire [-@barab_design-based_2004] describe the messiness of design-based research and that this creates a challenge to the researcher of how to present results in a coherent way which is of use to other practitioners. There is a tension between sticking closely to the context of the research and the concrete specifics or stepping back to generalise and being lost in abstraction. Here, I try to strike a balance which stays concrete but which also pulls from my observations a framework which may translate in to other game-making and creative project based approaches.

Another guiding principle of design-based research - which is present in the techniques of design experiments, mutual appropriation and participatory action research - is that research participants also influence the ongoing design of the research [@barab_critical_2004; @cobb_design_2003; @downing-wilson_design_2011]. The design of the research experiment and learning I started from a very open position and has evolved from several iterations of collaborative work with participants. One experimental team consisted of Home Educating families another involved local primary schools with Year 6 (10-11 year old) classes. Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly. Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture. -->





<!-- I have carried out six phases of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline the core activities that have taken place including only the most basic detail on tools used. In following sections, the development of toolsets are analysed in greater depth. The core of the game making programme, which emerged in the first phase and has remained, is a starting template of a simple platform game which participants alter to make their own. The evolution of different versions and locations of this starting template has proven to be a key marker of the progress of the programme.

#### Why not use constructivism / constructionism

COMPRESS THIS - ALMOST DROP TOTALLY - NOTE THE GENERAL ALIGNMENT OF CONSTRUCTIONISM WITH DBR METHODS


Hay describes DBR thus "learning occurs within a context of use, learning is frequently collaborative, learning as authentic, learning as inquiry-based not transmission-based" [@hay_constructivism_2001] p. 3. Thus the broad claims are in alignment with wider socio cultural approaches.


Cobb [-@cobb_where_1994] identifies two broad schools of constructivism, one focusing more on individual cognitive processes which follows the work of Piaget and the other drawing on the academic lineage of Vygotsky which locates knowledge formation as a cultural activity.

NOTE - THERE IS IMPORTANT WORK HERE ON AUTENTICITY- and the potential tensions with agency - ie if authenticity is working a the elbows of professionals, students have less ownership over the process.  [@hay_constructivism_2001, p. 34]


**Constructionism as applied learning and design  theory**

Much of the foundational literature on game making names constructionism as a guiding theory  (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996).

Constructionism as a movement has done important work in creating design guidelines but much weaker as either an underlying theoretical or analytical framework.

Some PhD studies, many from MIT,  use it as a guiding theory [Roque]

It can be viewed as a design technique based on constructivist roots [@kynigos_constructionism]

Constructionism is also described as  a theory of learning by Noss [@noss2015reconstructing] rather than a methodology. -->



### How Research Questions Evolved - JUSTIFICATION FOR CHANING FOCUS.



was driven by

Possible themes that had potential but which were disguarded included;

- Computation thinking & systems thinking
- Aligning with Project based learning

Themes emerging include the alternation of abstract and concrete as a suggested learning journey, explored in my journal. However this seems to be explored in research on semantic waves with studies of more breadth so it did not seem a good idea to follow that thread in my thesis.

There was something about the formalisation of this process into graph form which put me off. I also realised that the frameworks that I spent a while trying to make accessible and gameful in the design, grouping and theming of their presentation, had strong similarities to concepts of abstract curriculum if explored through a semantic waves lens. Curriculum seemed too well a well trod path for a PhD thesis.  

Instead the community elements of the learning experience regained focus during the process of coding. There were particularly interesting elements of the learning environment which contributed to notable behaviours.

The area of in-depth study of learning and wider behaviours in the development of coding. Work on roles by Barron  and developed by Roque showed promise identifying helpful roles and reflecting them back to participants. Such reflection sessions were not always replicable with a general home education group or other non-formal setting.  Could this implemented in the design, in the way reflective techniques were implemented in to games. Thus making it more playful/ gameful.
