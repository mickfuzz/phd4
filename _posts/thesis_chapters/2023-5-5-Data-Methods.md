## Research Questions - May 2023

- What pedagogical factors are significant to support novices learning coding, particularly in game making contexts?
- How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?
- How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?

## Introduction

This chapter is concerned with examining the impact on participants of the learning design explored in the last chapter.

The first section examines the impact of a process drama with an aim to establish and nurture community practice. It highlighted the value of introducing almost-real processes, near authentic tools and the possibility of learners developing learning identities within a drama frame.

Inspired by Heathcote, the importance and challenges of authenticity in tool use are examined, using activity theory concepts, in the context of seeding and nurturing learning community processes. The learner agency and the ability for learners to develop their identities as designers are of key interest. In addition to the use of tools in the starting learning designs I explore emergent community behaviour and design processes.

In the final section, the chapter builds on material explored in the literature review to discuss pedagogical factors are significant to support novices learning coding in game making contexts. Particular attention is given to processes which support learners to develop agency in the game making process.

The first section examines the impact of a process drama with an aim to establish and nurture community practice. It highlighted the value of introducing almost-real processes, near authentic tools and the possibility of learners developing learning identities within a drama frame. This section looks in greater depth at the impact on learners of the tools and suggested design patterns of the learning design explored in the previous chapter. -->

<!-- **Justifying selection of chapter contents**
The following elements have emerged from many in the learning design as of merit for sharing in this chapter based on the following criteria: key to the learning experience of participant; novel in terms of lack of existing research; supported by recorded data; and of potential wider interest outside this context.
IS THIS NEEDED OR IS THE CRITERIA ONLY THAT IT ADDRESSES RESEARCH QUESTIONS? -->


## Scenarios - drama processes


### Vignette 4.1.a - Introducing a drama process

This sections starts with a vignette of the start of an game making programme (forth phase as outlined in previous chapter). The participants have entered the room and chosen a laptop to work on. Some of the children are playing web-based games or reviewing the games that they have made previously. The session starts with a warm-up game which proceeds with a lot of developments including many false starts, changes of rules, development of tactics, appeals to be serious, full throated laughter and many restarts and which ends in good hearted failure.


<!-- The purpose of the vignette is to situate the reader, give an overview of -->

> Mick: Ok. So I’ve got a surprise. I don’t know if you know but as part of our Home Ed club we did a page of different games. So it’s on glitch.com and it’s called Glitch Game Club and it’s on there, there’s one for Home Ed Winter 2019 and here are all the games that we made. We made a lot of games. 15 games. This has not gone unnoticed because I got a message through this account. This is kind of a story now. We are entering a story. You have to use your imagination. We got a message and it was an audio message. If you guys take your fingers off your keyboards and have a listen to this audio message which is quite unusual as I don’t think it was from anyone on … this ... Earth.

    Greetings Earthlings, we have an important message for the Glitch Game Makers.
    We are the Weean. You would call us an alien lifeforce. We like to think of ourselves as friendly space cousins.
    We can see your Internet from space. We are contacting you because we know you are making games on the Internet.
    We are on our way to the Planet Earth, and we have an important mission for you. We are an Intergalactic Rescue team. We know you have problems on your planet. We can help.
    But we need to find out one thing first. Are you worth it? After we are gone will you also be able to help yourselves? Or are you already doomed to make the same mistakes again?
    You must pass this challenge. Make some games showing problems you have on earth. In the games also include ideas for how to solve them.

    We have some guidelines:

      • Make a game about a big or small problem to solve. If you can let us play it each week as you go along.
      • Give us an update each week by recording a group update.
      • Show you can work on your own but also work as part of a team.
      • We will also send you text messages with some mini-missions sometimes. Be sure to tell us how you do.

    Please now get started and come up with a new game about solving a problem on Earth.


> Mick: I couldn’t understand all of it but I tried to write it down as best as I can. So from what I’ve work out they’ve looked at our games and they’ve come up with a challenge for us. They are coming to Earth so they need to find out if we are worth saving. And the way that they are going to decide is by playing the games that we come up with. And they are going to set us little challenges. So. yeah, that’s the story. (with heavy irony) I’m pretty sure it’s true. (Mick and others laugh).

> So all they’re asking us to do is to come up with a game. We’ve got four sessions. They want a new game because they’ve already played our old games. It’s got to be something about the problems of the world. I’ve got a lot of problems. It could be big problem or a small problem. It could be about your problems. But also ideas on how to solve them.  
And yeah. That we can work by ourselves but also work as part of a team. So we’ve got to give them a report by the end of each session as well. That’s our mission.


### Description of Vignette 4.1.a
<!-- q: How much to reference back to previous chapter? -->

<!-- The drama game which is served to put participants at their ease, to make communication between peers easier after engaging in play, to decentre the learning environment by creating a circle with more equal participation. As explored in the literature review, the use of such games to help set up informal learning environments is COMPLETE  -->

<!-- After the  excerpt which introduces a dramatic scenario involving a fictional audience I orientate learners in suggested use of support documentation. A full transcript is available in the appendix which outlines that process. -->

While the process of introducing a scenario for participant to respond to is common in project based learning in this vignette this is developed to include a dramatic element. In this section, I describe the vignette using concepts from the domain of process drama: Further analysis follows in a later section.

While inspired by the work on Heathcote on Mantle of the Expert, not all element of the process align directly. For example, the drama does not try to position the participants as expert game makers in a professional context. However, the following tenets of MoE from Aiken's summary [-@aitken_dorothy_2013] apply. Aitken's and Heathcote's terms follow in italics. Within a _fictional context_ a _responsible team_ is contracted into a _commission_ by a _client_. The facilitator _frames curriculum elements_ as productive tasks and plans for _tensions_ to arise involving: _authentic contexts_, _messiness of learning_, maintaining learner interest and _resilience_ to overcome the _grappling and struggling_ involved.

The following sections explore some of these concepts in via the example in vignette.

_Contracting into drama_

As a facilitator I indicate that we are entering a dramatic process and attempt to draw everyone along with me using the following sentence _"This is kind of a story now. We are entering a story. You have to use your imagination."_ This serves to start the process of contracting in a drama. As a way to introducing an imagined audience. I reference that the games are online and have been noticed by aliens. The use of heavy irony in my voice when concluding the scenario, "I'm pretty sure it's true" and the resulting laughter are an informal collusion that we are playing along with this fiction. This is picked up on by both parents and children in recorded exchanges. For example, after engaging with a code example provided by myself in the role of the aliens, one pair comment:

> Parent: Look, this is what Mick's showed, what Mick's has done.

> Child: The Weean have done!

> Parent: The Weean, sorry yes.

_Facilitator activities in role_

My role is a link between the fictional commissioners of the games to be made.

This transcript above is a rare example of extended facilitator input as
instruction. As a practioner teaching technology I try to limit teacher talk and being overly directive to prevent learner disengagement. Balancing leaner choice with over-ambition is a tension explored in the previous chapter.  The drama narrative helped resolve some of this personal tension by allowing me to outline boundaries and be directive using the dramatic commission as a foil to help avoid the encounter feeling perosnally combative or controlling [heathcote_drama_1985].

_Learner activities in role_

Beyond the wider fictional frame of the making activity, learners were also sometiems asked to undertake some activities in role, in particular reflection in role. This and other example are explored via the second vignette.

<!-- Choices

- Or could look at the whole family unit mi, zi and ne - And their interactions with alien narrative. -->
<!-- Something like the social activity of Vignette Sh and Th - perhaps even that one - as it goes on to
describe the different kinds of interactions. But that is more interpersonal interactions for the most part.
Here we are looking at something cultural?? -->

### Vignette 4.1.b - Session reflections and secret missions


This second extract comes from the following session in phase four. In three of the four session the last 10 minutes of each session involved giving a progress update to the aliens.

> Mick: Ok are you guys ready to share back if you could come to this side of the room we are going to get Mark and Edward to share back first. Everyone can share back using this computer that the Weean are watching if that’s alright.

<!-- ![](./Pictures/2019-05-15-alien_feedback_1.png){width=90%} -->

> Mark: All we’ve done today is just get a background in and then we were just working on the one that the Weean had sent us about  dropping the coins in. Now that the weean have sent us the code we need for basically dropping stuff.

> The idea is planting trees. about dropping seeds. So we want to drop those and have some enemies that are tweening randomly around and also taking them away. The idea is to have a timer to drop a certain amount in a certain timeframe or you can’t go through to the next level. And the next level would be you go around and water all the trees. And the third one is you have to look after them all making sure they are not getting chopped down again by that tweening enemy. So we’ve got the concept and everything now and we’ve got the code So we should be able to make a bit of a jump forward now this week.  It doesn’t’ look like we’ve got any where but we have.

>(Mark laughs and others follow). So we’ve got the the background in and we know what we need to do about scrolling as well because we want to scroll across.

> Mick: That’s great.  Is there anything that you think you definitely want to be able to do for next time that you might want help with?

> Mark: Oh yeah. We’ll we’ve got a bit of space where we can work on it before we next come in so we’d like to ask the Weean some more questions. Is that the best way to do it?

> Mick: Yeah for sure and I can see that you guys have been talking to the Weean, Here this project here in your home page called Talking to the Weean allows you to talk to the Weean.  So you can go in there, click on Edit Project and if you click on this bit here that says WEEAN and then Markdown you can actually just ask questions in here.

![](./Pictures/2019-05-15-alien_feedback_2.png){width=90%}


> Mick: (reading out from the screen) Weean what’s it like up there? Asks Edward.
It’s cold and very big but quite tranquil.
What is your name? We are are the Weean we have no name, we are all the same.
That must be hard at xmas
(Mark and others laugh and smile.)
It is. It sure is.

![](./Pictures/2019-05-15-alien_feedback_3.png){width=90%}

>Mark: That’s tickled me that.

> Mick: So there you go. You can have a conversation there with the Weean in there using mark up code you can copy what’s there. Nadine can you talk through what you ha- What pedagogical factors are significant to support novices learning coding, particularly in game making contexts?

(Laughs from all)

> Nadine: I’ve not really done much today as I was busy doing stuff with Toby’s

> Dan:  We noticed.

> Nadine: We’ll I’ve changed the platform a bit

> Molly : You had a secret mission though didn’t you

> Nadine: Oh my secret mission was to change someone’s game, their character  or something and see if they noticed. And I think they did notice.

> Dan: We did. We did notice.

> Molly : You couldn’t not notice.

> Mick: It feels like you took the spirit of the mischievous thing and just turned up the volume.
(All laugh.)

> Molly: Sprite!

> Mark: We also had a secret mission.

> Mick: What was that?

> Mark: Ours was to change the sound on somebodies game.

> Nadine: Oh was it?

> Mark: Did you notice?

> Molly: Did you notice?

> Nadine: No (laughing)
(Incomprehensible many people talking or laughing at same time)

> Mark: Play it now!

> Richie: You definitely noticed. (Points to Mark and Ed) You definitely noticed my bit.

> (Nadine  goes to the keyboard and starts to play her game)

> Nadine: I can’t hear anything different
(Everyone laughs)

> Mark: I thought you were going to go- Aaahgh! But you didn’t say anything.

> Mick: So that’s interesting. some people notice some people didn’t.

### Description of Vignette 4.1.b

IS MORE DESCRIPTION NEEDED HERE. ?

In this extract participants are invited to take turns showing their game, recapping their progress and outlining next steps to the alien observers. I play the role as a liaison facilitating the process for the fictional, remote audience. I also draw attention to the secret missions that had been distributed to participants (along with social missions).

### Reflecting in role

<!-- **My reflections as a practitioner from my journal and those emerging from the process of transcribing and analysing the interactions.** -->
The impact of this set up can be compared to previous iterations of reflection in sessions.

In my journal notes for previously phases I noted my reluctance to shift learners away from making activities to reflective activities. I attempted sporadic "go-arounds" at the session conclusions but with limited success in terms of amount and quality of participation compared to these session which provided rich and consistent feedback. It is of value to review the grouping of participants in the still image in the vignette above in Fig 5.x.

The use of the screen as a link to the aliens helps justify moving participants and stopping all activity.

The simple clustering of participants so they were side by side and talking to a disembodied audience via a computer seemed to destress the feedback process. One of the younger participants Richie is participating on the margins but clearly following proceedings as his facial reactions to ongoing contents of feedback.

Even participants that were initially reluctant to share back and had never shared back publicly before in sessions, chipped in after other family member starting the process for them.  

While drama scenarios can aid reflection both in or out of drama, O'Neill and Lambert outline the value of in-drama reflection, noting it is "likely to be more powerful than end-of-session discussion, since it allows individual and group insight to be articulated as part of the context" [-@oneill_drama_1982, p. 144]. They propose one way of achieving in-role reflection is to introduce an additional character that acts as an external audience. The vignette show me adopting this tactic for end-of-session reflections.

DVELOP AND DEEPEN


<!-- As a facilitator, I picked this technique from work with the MMU drama department [@caldwell_drama_2019], the vignette above shows -->

<!-- NOTE ON CODING - LIMITED -->



### Observations on exploring documentation and accessing technical help within the drama frame

To develop the idea that participants could communicate directly with the aliens to ask help. I created a project in the shared glitch area that could be edited and viewed by participants. When in the vignette 4.1.b Mark asks "we’d like to ask the Weean some more questions (to overcome coding blockages). Is that the best way to do it?", he is referring to that page. To seed this process, I had entered a question sent by Mark and Ed into the page, and written a response on behalf of the aliens.

Dan and Toby also received help from the aliens to implement a pattern of creating random movement in their pac-man clone game. For this pair, the process of reading code answers gives the parent opportunity to deconstruct the code in detail to explore coding concepts. In later discussion, Dan uses the fiction on of the alien to playfully chastise me for using code syntax which was harder for novices to read. "Mick, do you think the aliens would mind if we get rid of the switch statement and replace it with some if-thens? They're just showing off these aliens aren't they?"

The process of writing down a request in a playful chat potentially addresses the barriers to asking fellow group members in an email group for help (noted in the previous chapter) by distancing the process.

The process also encourages adoption of professional practice of asking a written question to overcome a coding snag and thus builds experience of using technical terms.

While not all participants engaged with written tutorials. The next chapter explores the process in more detail from the perspective of a participant wanting to implement a particular game design pattern.

This observation is supported by research which encourages varied approaches beyond instruction-based approaches.  [@dietz_design_2021; @resnick_coding_2020]. [SEE LIT REVIEW ON NON-TUTORIAL PEDAGOGIES]. Written instructions provide barriers of literacy and change of habit explored in previous studies [@blunden2014seeking] which explore linking to written instructions within the drama frame provides greater incentive to engage in this way.

The exploration of documentation with the drama frame aimed to disrupt this pattern of identification giving participants a motivation to read in role.

Evidence for this means of communication is promising but this was brought into the design at a late stage and therefore there is not enough data to make larger claims beyond surfacing the potential.


<!-- NOTE - bRING IN A QUOTE FROM ATHENA TO SUPPORT?  -->

<!-- and attempting to shift patterns of working from printed sheets to working online This was partly to be able to capture how participants interacted with documentation more easily as I would be able to review it on their screen in captured data.  -->


### Observations on playful chat with the alien sessions

The process of asking the aliens for technical help within a code project sparked a playful process informal chat with aliens. I noted the ad-hoc encounter in our end of session reflection.

    Ed: Weean what’s it like up there?
    Ween: It’s cold and very big but quite tranquil.
    Ed: What is your name?
    Ween: We are are the Weean we have no name, we are all the same.
    Ed: That must be hard at xmas
    Ween: It is. It sure is.

Inspired by the popularity of students engaging with the fictional audience, I asked a student to participate remotely to play the part of the alien. Impact at the final session was significant with the young people with X out of Y engaging by writing off-the-cuff messages to the fictional audience, and supportive and celebratory messages coming from the alien.  

This addition to the main activity served a wider purpose of building an insider rapport, creating a fun atmosphere, celebrating the completion of games in the absence of a public showcase, and signposting other achievements.

In the final session where a large amount of time was devoted to interacting with the alien and thus was a danger of distracting from the primary aims.

In reality, in this instance for some pairs, this worked to free up the parent to engage with final tweaks and challenges. As the child interacted with chat. Parents debugged more complex elements of the game with facilitators and between themselves. Others engaged with the chat and encouraged their children to get feedback from the aliens about their game in particular.


### Use of side missions to encourage varied creative practices

The process started as child was left to their own devices as a parent was undertaking a social mission. Both the main mission of given in role to make a game to entertain and inform visiting aliens, and extra social and secret mission were delivered with the frame of a drama process. As explored in the previous chapter my motivations for introducing these missions for participants in role stemmed from a desire to encourage or to encourage emerging patterns of behaviour which appeared to help affect and identification with the community process of making.

A table of both social and public missions follows.

In the transcript above we see that in the reflection participants engage in a lively discussion about the secret missions they had been given. Encouraged by he mother Molly, Nadine shares that she has been highly engaged in the disruptive secret mission  (explored later). While Dan and Toby express playful frustration, Mark and Ed contribute by sharing their more subtle disruption and Richie is keen to have his rude noise mission noticed and commented on. Some public missions had a noticeable impact in this session particularly in  stimulating a discussion among parents around which arcade games they played as youths.

Thus these sanctioned non-design activities, designed to reduce participant stress, to encourage the exploration of the games of others are taken up enthusiastically by much of the community. In analysis of one key sessions involving missions from which the transcript was taken. Out of x participants, y visibly engaged with the secret missions during the session. BRING FIGURES TO THIS.

**Discussion RECAP AND SHIFT TO NEXT SECTION/ LINK**

The process was not without friction. After initially engaging with the process of secret games, Toby and Dave who were later working on a tricky coding process, expressed frustration at interference.

Thus, while promising limits to this process should be evaluated to avoid overly distrcutive behaivour which create barriers to progress. For example, time limits could be in place.  

It is of value to briefly discussion the value of these missions in relation to  drama process theory and play theory.

The drama process itself is a kind of magic circle.

Not all participants want to play by the rules. One example is the R child who takes great delight at the cheekynessn

the value of playing against the game or dark play.

#### Drama Process Observations / Discussion

This section discusses the use of drama process to help create coding communities of novices - (using AT theory and other relevant concepts - which are developed further in final discussion).

*Impact of working in role (explored via AT)*

Several of the processes above were completed in role namely; the wider mission of making a game; the end reflection sessions; social and secret missions, and guiding participants in the use of supporting documentation.

I previously made observations on myself and participants being more comfortable performing some of the activities in role. This section aims to explore these observations paying particicular attention to their value in the context of computer coding and using AT as a frame.

As a personal observation, When listing boundaries to activities, or  it felt similar to outlining the rules of a game: thus, less about controlling individuals and more about contracting into a gameful or playful experience. I felt more relaxed restricting choice in role via the proxy of a playful encounter.

I beleive part of my hesitancy in shifting activity from participant-led game making to reflection, or accessing documentation, stemmed from worrying that the learners would also find this shift in objective from the organically developing design and playtesting activity system to an externally imposed system of reflecting on progress or on the skills would be jarring, potentially disorientating and reduce learner engagement and positive affect towards the overally process. In other words, provoing a feeling that the fun's over, it's back to school.

I propose that the drama fiction eases friction between competing activity system objecties. For example, Heathcote refers to curicula content as an example of object interests, e.g. exploring detail in history, geography and writing accurately or with expression. Participants are more willing to overcome challenges or frustrations

Heathcote posits that learners especially those resistant to authoritarian teaching techniques, appreciate the effort of the facilitator in aligning "needs interests" to "object interests" [-@heathcote_dorothy_1984, p. 185], arguing that it can create a generosity of spirit on the part of learners.

This tallies with observations from journal, interviews and video data of participants.

The impact of time pressure to finish games also compounded tensions involving shifting away from game making to reflective activities. Even with the use of reflection in role, reflection activity was not prioritised in final sessions as time drew short.

OTHER FACTORS
  - result of analysis of interactions during game making,
  - to encourage some practices - AND IDENTITIES - ANY COMMENTS ignored by solely focusing on implementing code - game maker types (mention in previous design chapter)


LINK NOW TO AUTHENTICITY OF PROCESSES / TOOLS

While the use of a fictional audience in the drama is clearly inauthentic, it is however justified in the goal of injecting learner motivation.

#### Discussion on Autheticity

The following discussion aims to frame existing conceptions of authenticity of tool use in seeding new learning communities. The following sections of the chapter then aim to contribute new knowledge in the area of authentic tool and processes use in the domain of learning coding.

The tensions associated with the use of time by participants of the drama processes in this iteration mirror existing concerns in research.

Here the prioritisation is the construction of a supportive culture given the research which problematises the alien culture of coding.  The process of bringing people into the culture is worth allocating time to address inequalities.

These tactics (which?) and resulting tensions and have been explored in other domains particularly literacy and mathematics.

Exploring classroom culture, Engeström [-@engestrom1998reorganizing] notes the challenges of nurturing the motivation of students. His exploration of tensions which surround the objectives of children of "schoolgoing", cover aspects of x,y and z.


<!-- NOTE - BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE RQS - -->

Rainer, Bolton and other practitioner-researchers agree on the potential and value of exploring other subject matter and undertaking authentic project work within a drama frame [-@rainer_drama_2012]. One key consideration is the authenticity of the tools and processes involved. While Heathcote often explored issues in the context of making of the workplace through replicating working models of practice, she warns against asking participants to genuinely make items in the process explored. To do so, she argues, would expose their inexpertness in the cold light of day. This is uncovered in an interview extract from Bolton and Heathcote.

> "if they are makers of things (for example, shoes, ballgowns, or aircraft) they _must never_ (within the fiction, that is) _be asked to create the actual objects_. If they had to do this their _in_ expertness would become immediately apparent."[@heathcote_drama_1994, p. 18]

<!-- In the learning environment of this study there are broad similarities and some key differences in terms of supporting tools and processes. -->

<!-- NOTE ADD SOME DETAIL detail
But the are explored in more detail in the following section. -->
<!-- For example in this iteration, x is authentic, -->

In this study, a high degree of authenticity made possible, in a material sense, by the digital nature of the learning resources in that beyond a general purpose computer, no prohibitive equipment is needed. However, in terms of complexity of tools use, careful shepherding is involved to screen participants from overly complex processes and tools. The next section examines impact of relatively authentic toolset and also explores some of the limitations to authenticity, justifies these choices, and explores impact of these choices.

MOVE THIS?
The use of code playgrounds merits discussion in the way the tool itself is positioned. It is a tool based around a professional community. However in its styling it is playful and editorial picks and write up celebrate a playful spirit of creativity and sharing. There are strong mirrors there to the Scratch community and general maker ethos. The cross over between play and work may merit further investigation and integration into this model.

<!-- The  marshalling towards certain goals to maintain a shared script / experience. -->

#### Discussion on emergent practices to support varied learner identities.

The drama process also mirrors some of the aspects of the 5th Dimension project [@blunden2014seeking] [@blanton_effects_1997].supporting  Particularly the use of a playful, fictional absent character called the Golem or Wizard that both young people and adults collude to keep real.  DEVELOP OR LINK BACK TO LIT REVIEW

This element of the drama process emerged as part of work to support different learner identities outlined in the previous chapter research underpins the importance of allowing varied approaches to counter perceptions of computing and coding culture as alien.

 <!-- including exploring adapting Bartle player types to maker types to honour different approaches; the use of social and missions and  -->

The next section argues that the use of authentic tools and processes, while challenging for novices, can be facilitated by careful alignment of key design principles. It focuses on tools and processes that form part of my initial planned learning design. In contrast, in a later  section, evidence supporting the value of releasing control to allow emergent practices is presented.

NOTE - MOVE TO DISCUSSION?
While this distinction allows a clearer approach, there is a grey area of tools and processes which emerged in community practice, prove to be sucessful and which are then adopted as a suggested process for the next iteration of the design. This process of assimilation is discussed in final discussion along with x, y and z?

### Impact of main learning design tools

The choice of the starting toolset and mission shapes the balance and profile of initial community activity.


#### Observations on the use of code playgrounds and other authoring tools

<!-- Make point that it is hard to separate out tools and communities. In case of Mozilla, code playgrounds, and teach the web, and the culture of developers and teaching communities they are interlinked. Discuss and compare to Kafai in book, the lineage of Logo, Scratch.
Instead the more authentic approach of a real language.
 -->

As explored in the previous chapter the tools used by participants - Javascript as coding language, Phaser as a game making framework and Glitch as a code environment, are highly authentic and used by both professional coders and enthusiasts alike.

NOTE -  compare this to Scratch community - in scratch its easy to find games to remix. This has less of a ready made community of learners but feels more real (potentially (no data))

Learning technology in community settings can engender feelings of agency and motivation from part of wide network and the  diverse pathways. [@blunden_interdisciplinary_2009.

OBSERVATIONS TO ANSWER RQS

I draw the following observations from interpretation of video data of the use of the code environment.

Having a shared log in and thus a shared page for projects - making the social projects more possible.

The use of code playgrounds significantly reduces the load and difficulty for students. While, there is no comparative data on this study, I can support this statement through the following observations and support from other research
  - setting up a local coding environment is tricky
  - running a server and connecting in that way is beyond the techincal capabilities of most.

#### Impact of the half-baked starting template

The last chapter outlined the use and design characteristics of the starting point of an incomplete 2D platformer with low-spec graphics, with graphical scaffolding for text-based code, and deliberately broken. While the following chapter explores the use of game design patterns in detail, this section addresses the impact of the template on participant coding practices, based on video observations of learners directly interaction with the template triangulated with journal notes from phases 2 and 3 and participant feedback from phase one.

The game template itself contained guidance for users.

REALLY NOT SURE HOW TO STRUCTURE THIS - ALSO IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER.

<!-- Supporting cards to alter key game mechanics in simple steps were given to participants to allow them to progress. Additional support via tutorials was created based on their requests for different game design patterns.  -->

<!-- NOTE - CROSS OVER WITH PREVIOUS CHAPTER? PROBABLY DESIGN
(may need to move?)
Just create a summary here.

Existing research on digital making and creative coding has emphasised the role of personal expression to incentivise the creative process [Scratch roque community]. The creation of personally meaningful object to share with a community is a foundational concept in Papert's constructionism [CITE]. While the 3M design is more limited than a Scratch media project in the potential to incorporate home interests, participants did embrace existing immediately clear possibilities offered by the certain GDPs in the 3M starting design.

<!-- NOTE - add into the design chapter - challenge of personal expression, incoroporating previous gaming interests and unrealistic expectations.

<!-- NOTE IS THE FOLLOWING ALSO FOR THE DESIGN CHAPTER?

Another opportunity involved choice and design of game assets that allowed the expression of identity or a designed element - for example graphics, audio or a written message to appear at various stages of the game.

The incorporation and design of game assets is taken as work on GDP for the purpose of this model.

The core GDP involving game assets already exist in the starting template.
- Objects as a reward to incentivise player exploration
- Objects as a hazard penalising player progress

The starting three assets, player, hazard and reward provide a scaffold to  guide  the choice of game possible themes.

The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game. So while structured to avoid

### Observations on initial processes and tool use

Observations of the process of learners using template include;

NOTE - BOIL DOWN - EXPLAIN HOW SECTIONS DIVIDED UP.

- level design and prototyping: use of
- fluid variable editing effective movement
- The swapping of assets and more complex work with code syntax
- development of simple stories to bump personal expression and narrative

NOTE - All longer or shorter chains of actions , becoming operations - WHERE DOES THIS FIT?

NOTE - Also justify having so emergent results here , delay while accessing help to start 360 recordings h
As the end process is visible in fluid behaviour

These tools align with some key design considerations. [Brennan & Resnick]

 - Well suited to build a repeated design practice.
 - Small changes had big effects.
 - Variable changes needed immediate testing.  
 - Especially with starting documents,

<!-- While the design suits repeated design practice as illustrated by the example above, not all pairs or individuals interacted with GDP in such a neat way.

A later discussion section in this chapter illustrates a more complex interaction with design stages. -->


NOTE - TO INTEGRATE - SEPARATE SECTIONS OR BOIL DOWN


**Level design and prototyping**

As per Te and Da - example in previous chapter where the preview window replaced paper prototyping, rapids shifts between code and game are optimal and build a particular fluidity of practice

Lots of evidence of rapid changes and building of fluency of structured  
We saw the beginning of that process in Toby's practice in vignette in the last chapter.

A code snapshot showing the link of the graphical representation of the array.

There was also the process of messing the lines of code in the array. Which impacted syntax understanding.

**Fluid variable editing effective movement**

Movement was a key to playtesting feedback.
Some evidence of building profiency with significant work to change these three key variables.
However some stay with the starting variables and don't changes as much as they should.


**Incomplete graphical blocks to help seed narrative and art creativity**

The use of blank blocks encourages design as does the theme of environmental as steers participants into games involving animals. This is relatively easy to design and bring its own sense of game mechanics potentially.

**The swapping of assets and more complex work with code syntax**

The process of creating a pixel art chararacter and hazard involved using an online grid design tool called Piskel, creating an design of an appropriate size, saving, exporting as an image, downloading to teh harddrive of the laptop in use and finally uploading and incorporating the image into the code project and linking using code syntax. Authentic digital literacy skills involved include:

- File downloading and migration from one Web app to another via desktop
- Tab navigation
- Tool bar use in piskel , simplified photoshop , list different , crop, fill , export
- Copy and paste
- Selecting more than one line with mouse

The process of swapping assets in involved developing a complex chain of many of the individual actions listed above. These processes happened at wildly varied times for different people. Some participant became remarkably adept at these processes and in doing so transformed these changes into a fluid operation. Learners who had mastered the skill were asked by others for help. The rapid adoption and transfer of these processes between community members indicates the high motivational factor for participants of incoporating self-created graphical elements. These motivational factors are explored in a later section.



### Embedded GDPs in template vs GDPs in collection with supporting resources

The template has self contained help.

It was a big jump for some learners to move beyond these changes.
Thus extensive support was made available to facilitate this.

Some participant do not pick up all processes, some left behind and need support but that is available. Seeing patterns other peers adopted and creates a reason to ask for help. Peer propogation of patterns explored later.

### Narratives and graphics drawing on home funds of knowledge

At all phases of the learning design participants were able to input their own preferences in the narrative elements and themes of games. The design processes involved choice of game characters and objects that allowed the expression of identity or a designed element - for example graphics, audio or a written message to appear at various stages of the game.

The literature review explored existing research on how interests the use of home funds of knowledge facilitate the adoption of design and coding practices.

One pair Ch and Pa the grandparents of Te, included a narrative at the start of their game.

     var starttext = "This is a game which pits a honey bee against a swarm of Asian hornets,  which are alien invaders attacking bee  hives in the UK and which beekeepers are trying to stop spreading  here. Try to guide the bee to collect all the flowers without being caught by the hornets.
     Use the arrow keys to move the bee. Press return to START.";

This did bring their own role as beekeepers into the making space and started interesting conversations with other participants.

<!-- In a noteworthy exchange a young participant Zi asks one of the grandparents of child if they had done any amazing things in their life. This exchange follows

   zi: Have you done amazing things?

The exchange seems to throw Pa but they draw Zi's attention back to the game. Showing that it demonstrates their interest in bees as they are beekeepers.

The source of Pa's hesitancy to share more is not clear. However her willingness to share that part of her personal story via the narrative of the game is shown here as is the willingness of the young participant to ask about the personal experiences of the older participant during the process of peer testing her game. -->

Participants Mark and Ed designed one game around the characters of a
train driver that needed to collect coal. In subsequent post course interview the parent described the impact of the child feeling like they could bring their own identity and interest into the project.
"I know just your eyes lit up when you realised you could expand your interests into gaming."

See fuller extract in Appendix 4.x

<!-- NOTE
NARRATIVE / drama IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER?

Other participants were able to bring personal expression to the process via the creation of audio but in particular visual game assets.

NOTE - THERE IS A HIGH LINK WITH IDENTITY HERE - ESPECIALL IN MOLLY'S CASE STUDY - CAN THIS COME AS PART OF A DISCUSSION AFTER THE DRAMA SCENARIO SECTION? -

<!-- The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;] BRING ON OTHER LITERATURE HERE ON PERSONAL EXPRESSION, FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA. Roque, Scratch, Kafai, Gee etc. -->

<!-- Ideally look for evidence of sharing in communities, especially developing processes, avoiding traps which sap momentum, -->

<!-- While these aspects are covered in other literature, and are therefore not covered in depth in this chapter, it is important to include their strong presense in the data of study. And to situate them in relation to other chapter contents. HOW EXACTLY. -->

In one exchange we can see the growing sense of ownership and sharing helps develop skills of digital literacy concerning saving ongoing work.

In this exerpt parent Molly has spent time creating a pixel art representation of an alien

    Molly:– We’re finished.  Right what’s next? Now I’m an expert pixel? Now I have to figure out how to get it in there, don’t I? Without losing it. I’ll be very upset.
    Sonia:– Have you saved it?
    Molly:– No I’ve not saved it.
    Sonia:– Save there. (points to relevant button on screen)

The full exchange sees Molly cultivating a sense of ownership over the graphical element that she has created. There is also the development of a growing sense of competency in this area of asset design. She notes she is an "expert pixel". The growing mastering in this area also seems to help drive motivation to complete the next challenge. This ownership also appears to drives another technical process that of saving work. Or rather the identification with the work pushes her fellow parent to preserve her work to prevent a repeat of losing work previously which she had just shared. See fuller extract in Appendix 4.x

The aspect of pattern completion driving technical process adoption is explored in the next chapter.

While, the personal expression via narrative and asset design can be engage and sustain the motivation of participants, these processes brought tensions identified in the _design chapter_ namely: (edit down into list? )

**Exploring Tension - time spent on task - ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**
Take the example above, through use of pixel art editor, and template with small, retro themed graphics, as a designer, reduce the propensity to spend along time on asset creation as retro pixel art is quicker to make.

**Expectations- ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**

- incorporating familiar or personally meaningful elements can involve challenges including that of unrealistic expectations based on previous game playing experiences

## Emerging processes and use of tools

The process of facilitating for emerging learner identities and practices, via the processes and tools explored above, opens up flexibility in the way learners approach the design processes.

My role as a facilitator rather than a instructor was key to this process as has been explored in related research (CoP, MoE )
- Heathcote's take

Where the activities, processes in the previous section were imagined, often in response to community need, by myself, the following emerged from community use.




### Play-testing

 <!-- NOTE - Include examples here which do not talk of GDP explicitly - but other cultural aspects. -->

As explored in the literature review and previous chapter, playtesting is a rich and varied learning opportunities. By the time video data recording started in phase three there were already complex patterns and behaviours at work.

There were a variety of ways in which playtesting happens and how younger and older participants looked to give and take from the experience. Playtesting appeared to be suited to allow a diversity of community-building behaviour.

Older participants often used this as a way of being supportive to both parents and young people. This happened in the following ways:
- praising graphical content
- making links with home interests of participants and building rapport - ( e.g. do you like dogs? )

**Emerging cultural norms of playtesting**

Reviewing data around playtesting the games of others in sessions, and discussion around the final play of the external audience at final showcase.
and challenge - a culture of "hardness", curiousity about number of levels, as a vehicle for peer support,

In the last chapter,
Find examples

When explored from wider perspective, the hard is good lens, is very limiting.
The following paragraph explores different perspectives on hardness / challenge.

- arcade games were designed to be hard to extract money from players
- nes games reputation for being brutal as they often had no way to save states
- this developed later for snes games , finding challenge and other forms of ways of maintaining interest for different genres of games_

Other observations
- The process of teaching challenge via balance cards can happen early on
- some participants are resistange - see Molly's interactions - does this matter?

**Play testing - and embodied participation in the games of others**

study the body language of those play testing games.
what is there ? - included

- wrestling for control
- movement around the room between screens
- calling across room
- clustering, remaining on outskirts.


NOTE - Nadine's play on secret missions mirrors some of her more spontaneous play in the previous phase - thus one informs other

### Building Identities as Game Makers  - EXTENDED

PARK THIS FOR NOW IN DESIGN CHAPER

COULD RETURN TO THIS IN A DISCUSSION CHAPTER - AS HAS IMPACT ON GDP TOO.

My journal notes see an evolution of attempts to try to build into the program, activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers or more generally digital designers. In and early tentative attempt to define in broad strokes the types of game maker behaviour and underlying goals. In doing this I have taken inspiration from Bartle's game player types Hamari and Tuunanen, 2014). I translated player types to maker types based on notes in my observation journal and extracts from screen capture data. The following list of *Game Maker *types:

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

For examples in the Vignette of S and T's interaction we can see attributes of the child as a Glitcher. In terms of understanding of the game as a dynamic system, this is seen clearly in the parent's alarm at the child's deletion of all elements of hazard. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. "It's no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid." The child seems determined to remove all hazards. My understanding is that she is also aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play. They seem to take pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context. The process mirrors play theory concept of playing against the game or dark play Sutton-smith, 2001).

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with the positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you. -->



<!-- NOTE - Preceeding To follow shifts in perspectives bound up in designing for others, and the shift in layers of abstraction,

### Observations on emerging divisions of labour

NOTE THIS SECTION DESCRIBES EMERGING PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOUR - BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR IF IT ANWSERS THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS DIRECTLY.

#### Alternating coding


The parent cedes the keyboard and mouse and sometimes swaps chairs to allow child to play test the game created.

This follows a pattern of X   

One parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles."

The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.


#### Shifting roles in partner work

At one point the testing process Sh shows frustration as gravity value is very low making any movement very slow with little control. While the child has previously rejected increasing the value, the parent's initial acceptance of this decision is later questioned. The parent who has to do the majority of the testing is more insistent to remove a frustrating part of the testing  process.  

<!-- Discussion drawing on more radical attempts to describe the best way to bring young learners into a design practice.
Perhaps in the field of participatory design. -->


Toby and Dan's pair process of using supporting documents here as they work shows similar shifts. The professional practices of accessing professional documentation involves cultural elements here of a family learning culture between these two playing out in these processes. Te and Da's design process is more guided and focused than many other participants. As this interchange exploring professional documentation resources continues, the father starts as a facilitator  taking a lead from the direction of the child. However, as the dialogue progresses he begins to be more directive, initially by asking leading questions and testing existing knowledge.

Finally in order to complete the research task after reaching the beyond of the child's knowledge, the father issues a series of more direct instruction, directing the research and proposing a coding solution for their new game design pattern. (INCLUDE TRANSCRIPT AS APPENDIX?)

This approach appears to be influenced by Da's experience as a software engineer and volunteer at Coder Dojo (Glossary). Interview extracts (included as appendices) show a direction to support the novices direction as a facilitator where possible.

    I try never to touch the keyboard of who's there. If they are stuck on something I always tell them what to do. Even if it's then taken me five minutes to explain what a semicolon is. And point. It's that key. Because it was just, I could do it so effortlessly. I think I'm sure I put people off very quickly by "Dave did something really quickly. I don't know what it was.".

 This extract from interview data indicates a priority to support the learner to develop independently but to still be very present in the support process.




#### Code roles  and experimentation

While the parents are the ones doing the majority of the heavily lifting importing new code, children are observering and emulating this behaviour.

In one interaction child Ne visits the page to add a mechanic, starts to scan it, highlights some code, but then seems to change her mind
- perhaps recognising limits - or fearing the process of breaking her game - and returns to more familiar territory of changing game assets and level design.

### Emerging tactics in accessing help from peers and facilitators

A common teacher tactic is ask three then me.
The family group of Mi, Zi and Ne showed a lot of flexibility and tactical choices when trying to overcome blocks.

Zi more directly and loudly asking for help for faciliator often followed by comment from his mother to leave him alone.

in 2019-03-18 - 18.20 Mi's meets many small blocks and asks for help from a variety of people.
- Student helper to get online,
- Peer parent about use of piskel, and then her son
- Ne daughter
- Mick overall facilitator

Other pairs and individuals had other tactics.
Parent Mark made a comment showing that he was aware of the particular value of the in-class sessions to overcome some kinds of blockages.



#### Accessing online, professional/community documentation

The provided documetation provided a safe space. However, some participants embraced more authentic sources of documenation and code examples. They risked the additional confusion in a trade off to overcome the limitations of the existing help.

Toby and Dan - Accessing documentation Phaser

The process of modelling the specific practices of accessing developer documents and help forums is a form of apprenticeship and a direct sharing of a professional cultural practice.

Te takes a lead on looking for help on added a new GDP following enemies. He starts with menu, then book, then Da suggests googling and thus taking a step outside of the walled garden.

Discussion. There are pros and cons stepping outside that garden. Confusion, conflicts, complexity. etc. Vs. generating new patterns and personalisation of game content.
NOTE - THIS LINKS WITH DISCUSSION ON CHOICE OF DESIGN MORE GENERALLY.



### On different kinds of snags / blocks

#### On Debugging and Embracing Different Types of Errors

NOTE - COMPRESS AND  MOVE TERMS TO GLOSSARY -

<!-- In the context surrounding the interaction outlined in the above vignette, the parent had tried valiantly to overcome a conflict caused by incomplete documentation and her own incomplete knowledge of the computational patterns used in the construction of the game's code. -->

In analysis of journal notes and recorded screens I began to identify different kinds of problems that blocked participants from progressing. I refer to different kinds of blockages which result from tensions and contradictions between different elements in activity systems.

Some blockages were non-technical including hunger or grumpyness between participants, others were due to lack of access to the right tools or understanding of processes, others were particular types of coding error.

I propose that more granular understanding  of different kinds of design blocks can help facilitators and ultimately learners in building agency in their response to them.

For example,  on into the detail and types or errors.  These include:

 -   **Syntax and Program Errors** are errors in your code which stop the game from functioning at all, often resulting in a blank screen.
 -   **No Behaviour Bugs** are errors which in your code which don't stop the game from functioning but your intended effect is not present when it should be.
 -   **Glitches** don't stop your game from running but as you play you see that there is an unintended effect. The game does something different from what we want it to do.


<!-- #### Examples of Glitch types of errors

Short examples of different types and the affect implications.

Glitch errors can be productive.

**Productive in exploring code / creating new game opportunites**
An interesting one where the x / y axis mix up for Te 2019-03-18 leads to a new challenge in the game.

**Productive in in**

- Glitch - 2019-05-08 - Te and Da  - create moving enemy but it totally leaves the screen. This caused amusement and participants knew how they thought they would follow that up.

 The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful. -->

#### Discussion on nurturing tactical responses to blocks

How do you develop a more granular sense of the kinds of blocks, errors and how to overcome them.

Professionals build up this sense through experience.

While some practices are taught many others become ad-hoc rules of thumb that are difficult to communicate in abstract ways.

More research would be welcome on how to help learners pick up these understandings.
Further analysis of the different kinds of errors that are likely to arrive and testing different strategies for dealing with them that take into account the zone or proximal development of the participants may provide not only useful input for the participants, but also opportunities to check understandings of processes and game patterns and computational patterns in use.

Question - do more useful / less de-motivating errors result from remixing and game patching?

<!-- Question - what impact does the process of being driven by GDPs have on how users deal with errors? PERHAPS EXPLORE LATER? -->


Perhaps see the above glitch examples. Not fully understanding every line of code can create a fun, unpredictable environment. We can infer from these examples that wrong behaviour may be easier to investigate and to correct than no-behaviour errors. Aspects of the design encourage this kinds of error. Certainly the process of code patching does.

 <!-- As mentioned in the previous sections, after analysis of this vignette in particular, it seemed promising to investigate behaviour and engagement at different stages of design process for this pair.

<!-- #### Discussion on design stages and GDP for this pair - DROP THIS?

 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.
 This parent was much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents. The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker/player type (concepts explored in previous chapter). This interpretation seems confirmed by less social interactions compared to may parents. The pair engaged far less in play testing of other games and peer support to overcome barriers. They also followed the stages of design more closely than may other groupings, an observation which is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

 This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." This alternation is driven or facilitated by the different stages of implementing GDPs. The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

 Using the coded data from nvivo to compare design cycle stages with pair collaboration, it can be observed that the most likely stages for pair collaboration were during the Ask/Imagine stage, Testing and Planning.

 The vignette shows evidence of that the actions of the parent to re-engage the child at different stages of the design cycle helped sustain the child's engagement in the more focused design process happening on the screen. However, an opposing pattern of behaviour may also be valid. When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups. Within Rogoff's model of community of learners [-@rogoff_developing_1994], this observation is viewed as valid form of participation. The child's ability to legitimately disengage from pair coding to observe the work and interactions of others in this emerging community of learners may also be sustaining.

 It is of note that when describing the design cycle for this family that this family along with others are working with decomposed smaller design challenges in the form of implementing GDPs. Thus the cycle is repeated for each new pattern that the pair take on. These smaller design iterations can be expressed within the framework of AT as an activity system. -->

 <!-- #### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

 NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION?
  NOTE - This more general observation may be part of the previous chapter

 We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

 - The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
 - This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

 Discussion

 - The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

 The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity. -->

## Discussion

Deepening from observation, evidence to synthesis in relation to other research.

### Discussion on flexible design practices (RENAME NOW? )

This section looks as some of the emerging patterns of design practice of participants. When coding data a design cycle framework was one of the code structures. Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share. When coding I quick became aware of the limits and challenges to coding to this. There may not be neat matches and at some stage if the process is very fragmented. Other researcher questions the value of persriptive design stage approache as a planning or analysis. Other less formulaic theoretical perspectives on creative processes exist including rhizomatic approaches [@de_freitas_classroom_2012]. And some attempts have been made to incorporate design thinking with a rhizomatic approach [@biffi_chasing_2017-1].



<!-- While design cycles was not an explicitly part of the game making instruction, certain interventions supported this approach. In particular the use of maps as a planning and reflection tool and the use of playtesting as a social and personal form of evaluation of emerging designs. -->


<!-- ### Valuing digital laundry and faff time  -->

For example a lot of time in this informal game-making sessions were spent on activities outside of this cycle. For example, opening up the right tools, navigating to correct locations and finding past assets involved a fair deal of effort and collaboration.

<!-- I have been pragmatic and map elements like this these loosely. Where appropriate I make notes on that activity in free form areas of other documents like spreadsheets. -->

<!-- This limits claims I can make from the coded data. However it raises interesting points which merit discussion. -->


many creative moments happen in times not neatly represented in the cycle. For example the navigation to the right location in creative software, finding assets, migrating assets between authoring tools, converting to correct formats, evaluating new tools. These are practices that I am personally familiar with. I call them digital laundry or digital housekeeping. Things that at times can be low attention span or which can be extremely frustrating.

I noted in analysis of data that along with frustration there are also moments of creativity, and there are bonding moments which appear to be helped by this activity which is at times quite undirected but also shared. For example the process of finding assets in the shared Piskel gallery served to keep individuals informed in directly of progress being made, and to spark curiosity in the creations of others.

In addition, some of the missions encouraged this kinds of social activity. As examples, Mark toured the other participants and sparked a lively discussion about game playing in response to the mission of "Find out the favourite games of 3 other people".

**Improving is Creating and Planning when remixing**

For example when altering jump and move variable for the first time. They are deliberately set low. Thus while technically this is improving the code. As the participant is meeting those variable for the first time we can recategorise in the create category.

### Encouraging a culture of emergent improvisation/agency in the design process.

- Responses to choice of tools & Communities Choice of Coding Tools / Environment / Communities






**Fluidity of design practice (driven by playtesting?)**

Another example shows an evolving fluidity in response. Ch incorporates a boost to player health after a level after being given feedback during playtesting.

Other participants also demonstrate fluidity of response although to a less sophisticated degree. The process of altering design especially suits a fluid response as makers build their design skills by rapidly altering  

This is participatory appropriation in that it is a new GDP that stems from original thinking on the part of the participant.  

<!--## Community Aspects of the 3M design -

When reviewing video data. There are lots of interactions, peer and pair, that are influenced by the community focus of the learning design.
A bullet point summary follows
- helpers circulating (2019-03-18-te for example )-  playtesting as a community activity and feedback.
- getting help from all sources possible -->



**Digital Jamming**

<!-- Pumping up the Jam - -->

In many interactions we see improvisational approaches.

Example from Te and Da - 2019-05-08 -

    Da- use paper to design
    Te - I'm just going with it

The tools, process and the community encourage a jam / improvisational approach. Remixing, chipping away, a shattering of design cycles. More of an informal approach

The concept of Jam is explored in rapid, improvisational events called Game Jams.

Some of the following sections discuss design factors and participant responses which fit this category of informal creative practices.
player types

This has an example in the use of sound making software Fi & Ma -
The process of tinkering and messing spurs creativity that doesn't map to a design cycle.

They are in an evaluation of tools which could be said to be in planning stage,
However this quickly become creation as they decide the spontaneously created music is preferable to the one created using a different tool at home.

The joint jamming then has created two different soundtracks. This sparks a new thought to create different soundtracks for different levels.

This would fit within the Imagine stage.
Plan then Create then Imagine then Revise all in the space of a minute.

<!-- Implication one - When mapping the activity to a design cycle. There may not be neat matches and at some stage if the process is very fragmented the researcher or teacher can legitimately ask how valuable the design cycle is as a planning or analytical tool. Other less formulaic theoretical perspectives on creative processes exist including rhizomatic approaches [@de_freitas_classroom_2012]. And some attempts have been made to incorporate design thinking with a rhizomatic approach [@biffi_chasing_2017-1]. -->

#### Implications - PERHAPS MOVE?

Thus when designing a program and thinking of how to present the process to participants, over structuring activity or even teaching a design cycle approach explicitly may be not be productive or accurate.

Instead the emerging process relates more closely to tinkering methodology -

Which raises question why tinkering and improvisiational approaches are not more widespread.

One challenge is the diversity of the directions in which learners may want to go and the difficulty to structure code patching approaches in a way which can support novice coders. Drawing from authetic resources can be chaotic and create too many problematic errors.

Also participants lack the concepts of computing and necessary language and are thus not able to find the necessary materials easily. The next chapter explores the use of a collection of game design patterns to help address these issues.

#### Conceptualising emergent agency in this study

Designing for tool and process use invites discussion of active possibilities of the design - aka - embodied agency of the design - as per non human methodologies.


**On double stimulation and agency**

Conflicts and tensions between participant motives and different parts of activity system are sometimes revolved quickly through change, or remain more persistant and can be referred to as blockages.

Double stimulation refers to the use of tools and processes to overcome such conflicts awareness of these tools and active use of them engenders agency [@sannino_principle_2015]. While many studies have examined the process in professional settings there is a paucity of study in the area of "student-centered contexts of learning" [@isaac_cultural_2021, p. 93].

Blockages caused by contradictions are also analysed the fields of design and HCI with an aim of revising designs to remove them [@karanasios_moving_2021].

**On affordances and anchors**
<!-- NOTE
AT's relationship with affordances more here [@ba_erentsen_activity_2002; @] -->

Affordances have been misused, assigned magical properties, including agency of themselves. However, affordances are originally conceived of as part of activity, not separated from it [@ba_erentsen_activity_2002]. Sannino augments the concept of transformative agency by double stimulation (TADS) with a metaphor of a sea vessel warping using kedging anchors.

    We may think of the second stimulus as an anchor. Anchors are commonly understood as stabilising devices to prevent a vessel from moving. However, not all anchors have this function. Beside the heavy-weight anchors, there are also kedge anchors serving the purpose of ‘warping,’ that is, pulling the anchor once it has settled on the ground, for moving the vessel away from a problem area. [@sannino_transformative_2022, p. 4]

In this metaphor emphasises the active volition of participants to overcome tensions and blockages in learning. In our context learners would throw an anchor of intention out into the learning environment to then pull on to
Not all throws will be successful. The anchor may slip or it may catch on something in the learning environment that allows the leaner to pull  

Affordances in the learning design can be viewed in this frame as a catching point for these anchors [@hopwood_agency_2022]. An effective learning environment provides a sea bed with many rocks (affordances) for warping anchors (volitional acts of participant agency to transform learning).

In a later chapter, I propose that The implications of these combination of concepts the practice of designing and facilitating effective and engaging creative and technical learning environments. I will extract observations from this research that extend beyond the process of coding into other domains.

### Discussion - on learner identity, anxiety and implications in relation to other research - AND CONCEPTIONS OF AGENCY.

NOTE - INCLUDE HOME ED CONTEXT TO AN EXTENT TO PRECEED LATER CAVEATS IN CONCLUSION

Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].

This chapter supports this research and also finds game making as  a suitable medium to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

Conceptually, within AT, these interventions and design choices which yield possibilities for self-exploration can be see as potential anchor points to increase learner agency.

In summary:

<!-- Family game making, of completing projects together with your parents or siblings has potential to remove the **I'm not that sort of person** barrier of cultural identity as participants are surrounded by their people. -->
- the choice of retro games as a medium provokes sharing for older participants while their enduring popularity maintains common ground with younger participants;
- encouraing game playing and discussion of games helps surface positive affect and   


**Discussion on reducing learner anxiety surrounding text coding**

<!-- especially in response to the withdrawl of one family due to hardcore coding and feedback that -->

Elements of the learning design that aimed to create an welcoming learning environment included:

- adapted my sessions to ensure a consistency of non-digital and playful activities.
- reflection in role
- encouraging flexible making patte
- flexible pathways to making resources and navigating their learning.

This chimes with existing research:

- the importance of managing learner anxiety in second language acquisition [@krashen_principles_1982; @young_language_1992]
- deeper into Heathcote
- something about authenticity of audience, and resulting time constriction creating the right kind of pressure / motivation. Game Jams/ Hackathons

These can be synthesised using TADS metaphor and enriching it with a greater focus on the specificity of what makes the anchor points catchy. Thus developing the metaphor in include the importance of affordences which can be responsively designed into the learning environment.



<!-- Some of these observations and starting points were the continuation of my own work as a facilitator of open making focused training sessions. Especially the use of fun, communicative drama games to create a playful atmosphere for learning. An observation from my journal during phase one of the program underscored the importance of this starting points.  -->


<!-- The challenges of helping participants increase their confidence and commitment in program participation are explored in the the following descriptions detailing specific activities which were added to the program. -->





### Link section to next chapter

We can note tension of restricting user choice in order to create more "visible anchor points" to increase potential for increasing the agency of learners. Like swimming in a protected pool rather than in the sea. This tension is explored more in following chapter.

    Ma - Oh, definitely. Yeah.
    Mick: Let's ask Fi that as well.
    Mark: Yeah.
    Mick: Can you do feel like in making the games, you're able to bring your own interests or things that you related to into it?
    Ed: Yeah. The Fireman.
    Mark: Yeah, well, tell us about that game. Tell about your interests and stuff?
    Ed: A little fireman, he's going around collecting coal for this train. They lost it. But then there's sheeps on the line.

    Ed: I wanna be a fireman (on a steam train).
    ...
    Ed: I really like trains, since like I was very, very young.

    Mick: Do you think I mean, was that was that like something that helps you a little bit keep your interests go in for the game?
    Mark: I think it excited you to have to build a fireman sprite? Is that right?
    Ed: Yeah.
    Mark: and to have it train themed, didn't that like, keep your interest in the designing part of it up? Is that true?
    Ed:  Yeah.
    Mark: Because the whole theme of it. Just I know just your eyes lit up when you realised you could expand your interests into gaming.

#### Appendix 4.x  - Addition to vignette 4.1 - documentation in drama

> Do you know what I also wanted to share with you? Last time we were doing different sheets and everything. You were getting good at working through the sheets. And also looking at this page (show splash page on screen of menu of game design patterns)  which is at ggc-examples.glitch.me . And I’ve done some changes to it. There are two different parts. I want to make this better for you guys, I want to make this somewhere you can go so you can click to find out the help that you need. Any ideas you have for making this better would be really good.

> One thing I can think. You see here (points to moving enemies as an example on screen). If you want moving enemies. If you click on it, it opens an example with the code to make moving enemies but it’s not really obvious how you would to put that into your game. So to find that you’d have to click on this here  link to tutorials. (Mick points to the link to tutorials text/link). Which tells you how you put it in the game. And then you’d scroll down this bit (demonstrates navigating the tutorials menu) and select add moving enemies here. So,  I was showing this to some people yesterday and they couldn’t really work that out.
So what they suggested is. why don’t I put it so there’s a link so right to the chapter for how to do it right next to that image.
So that makes sense really so I’m going to to do that.

> So if you click on that (referring to tutorial link) if you want to add a moving enemy.
I’ve tried to put a bit like that (referring to illustration below on code patching). What that means is, you’re looking for that bit of code at the top. And you’re going to copy it and paste it into that bit at the bottom. Where it says Playstate.preload. That’s the part of the code that you need to put it into. Just to make it a bit clearer.

> Mick: Well actually, you’re putting it inside of it. So here you would copy it and in your code example. You then  look for that bit where it says preload. You then put it inside of it at the bottom of that.   

> Molly: So just insert it somewhere.

> Mick. Yeah insert it. So here we’ve got different parts of our game. We’ve got preload. We’ve got create. And we get used, we start to get used to finding them. In this one it’s preload that’s the one that its saying we should put it inside of. And then this  next bit. It’s saying, ah, you should put that into your create function.
So we’re moving in the right direction. But any other things where you think. Ah that could be easier. Let me know and I’ll try to make these resources much easier.
