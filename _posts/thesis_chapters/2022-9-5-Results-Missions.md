## Introduction to This Writing

In the previous chapters we will have looked at the research landscape to develop coding and design practices in line with social understandings of learning. In particular, the intentional development of a communities of designers and coders with an educational aims has been explored paying particular attention strategies that educators can use to aid these processes.

The concept of tensions from Activity Theory has been cited as helpful as an analytical tool particularly in informal and non-formal settings.  

The structure of this thesis identifies streams within the resolutions to these tensions. The explores resolutions which are presented to participants and facilitators as Missions.

## Methodology

**Comment:** More writing in this area is available online at - https://mickfuzz.github.io/phd4/chapters.html

In the previous chapter on methodology, I have outlined how, in line with a social approach, as a researcher / participant I evolved identified tensions that emerged in the process of developing a learning design.

In this writing I will outline the data collected and how it is analysed. And perhaps which questions the data answers.

<!-- For both participants there is an explicit awareness of game making patterns and concept of the game as a dynamic system. Both seem to drive their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game.

Game making patterns are outlined by both the child and parent. They talk of adding more levels, of the mechanic of keys and doors and then progressing to another level. The child takes delight in outlining this pattern of game progression. The transformation from the period of time when her parent was problem solving code is dramatic. I propose that a contributing factor to this motivation is the ability to replicate a familiar pattern of game play via her own work in construction. It is the ability to translate this home knowledge into her own artefact which gives a sense of mastery over an otherwise foreign environment.

In terms of understanding of the game as a dynamic system, this is seen clearly in the parent’s alarm at the child’s deletion of all elements of hazard. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. “It’s no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid.” The child seems determined to remove all hazards. My understanding is that she is also aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play.  -->



### Missions

Many commercial open world games offer a central challenge consisting of small incremental missions and then optional side missions. Open world games increase user choice and thus give players a greater feeling of agency. To mirror this approach, the main challenge of the 3M model is to create a playable game around a theme for a real or imagined audience with learners given the choice to add many optional features to the game. This approach steers students towards developing their use and understanding of coding structures, debugging practices and systems concepts. In addition, side missions encourage social and playful coding approaches which help develop a community of coders.

**Side Missions:** Bartle proposed that online gamers play games for different reasons and proposed a initial typology of gamers as socialiser, griefers, achievers and explorers [@hamari_player_2014]. You can find out what kind of game player you are with an online test.[^6] I propose there are also different styles of game makers. Some like to develop a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step. Some are happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results. More social makers like to find out about the games of others or tell stories within games while others mess around with the code to break it interesting ways. To encourage these valuable social coding practices I created extra missions which are available online.[^7] I avoid any claims of fixed learner types here and offer these interpretations primarily as a way to encourage meta-cognitive reflections and choice of activity in line with UDL principles.

**Game Design Patterns as Main Missions:** Design patterns are most commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing but they are also useful for all levels of learners. Design patterns are rooted in real-life incidences of problems that are often solved in a particular way. They are concrete examples of coding principles in context. Design patterns can help the development of coding communities if more experiences coders take the time to document the patterns they use in an accessible way for novice coders. For educators the use of design patterns can help support learners develop coding proficiency by providing scaffolding and modelling good design decisions. However, one of the challenges for teachers of using worked examples and design patterns is how to integrate them into student-led design challenges. In the 3M model rather than following a step-by-step tutorial learners start with an incomplete game template and add new features as they choose. Each feature is described as a mission. This approach follows the Use-Modify-Create model to limit learner anxiety for novice coders and to scaffold the acquisition of coding and computational thinking concepts [@lee_computational_2011]. I worked with learners to create a wish list of game features to create a 2D platform game. These features included moving hazards, jumping on enemies, finding a door or flag to progress to the next level. We can describe these features as game design patterns. Driven by the requests of learners, I developed tutorials to support students implement these patterns. This approach aligns with inclusive education principles in that it increases the choices of students, scaffolds the way they can access resources and allows them to keep a track of their own progress.

<!-- You may be able to create a menu of printed or online patterns or examples that students can draw on as needed. Perhaps particularly common examples can be modelled to the whole class when it is clear that many students will benefit from that approach. -->

In my final implementation of the 3M model students picked missions from a choice of printed cards. There were four colour themed categories of missions. _Game mechanics_ are features to do with the actions of the game. _Game space_ patterns address the layout of the game. _Game polish_ patterns involve adding music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements. Finally _System and Challenge_ patterns look at how different elements interact to create challenge in the game. An example of a game mechanic design pattern follows.

BOX BEGINS

Your mission is to apply the following pattern to your game. There are supporting step-by-step resources available if you need them. When you finish be sure to reflect on how adding this pattern helps your understanding of the computing concepts and similar patterns listed. This concludes your mission.  

* **Name of Game Design Pattern:** Jumping on Enemies to Zap them

* **Type Pattern:** Game Mechanic

* **Description:** If the player is descending from a jump when they touch the enemy the player is zapped and in this case disappears.

* **Need for Pattern:** Enemies create challenge and being able to jump on an enemy is a good way of clearing the area you want to explore.

* **Coding Concepts involved:** Arrays[^8], Change Listener[^9]

* **Links to other Computing Patterns:** Systems Dynamics[^10]

* **Related Game Patterns:** You'll need to have added the **Add Enemies** pattern to your game before you can add this one.

BOX ENDS

In addition to outlines of game patterns, print-outs or on-line documents to support learners to implement the code needed are provided. While on-line documents allow learners to copy and paste code thus avoid many syntax errors, printed or incomplete code examples provide a greater level of challenge. Supporting resources help resolve tensions around learners getting stuck and needing a lot of facilitator help. These resources can help teachers deliver game making in a classroom context. Educators can alter resources to vary how much detail is provided in supporting documents to suit the challenge level for students. I work with young coders, thus I normally provide significant coding scaffolding. Once learners have built familiarity with code structures, processes and the coding environment, I provide less complete code examples and thus reduce the scaffolding.

## Findings Emerging related to Game Design Patterns / Missions

In a previous section I have explored how game design patterns became the primary unit of activity for participants. This, more unit than the overall making of a game, took up the majority of their focus.
<!-- (see blunden for more on project as unit of Activity
https://www.activityanalysis.net/andy-blundens-vision-of-activity-theory/ )  -->

We have also looked at the other studies which look at game design patterns as a useful tool for advanced and less frequently for notice coders.

In the following sections, I draw on observations of participants in practice to outline how game design patterns are used in the making of games. I use extracts/ vignettes to do this.

## Cultural Plane / Apprenticeship

This has been in explored in more depth in the Chapter on Methods / Cultural Plane. To recap.

Design patterns used in other contexts as a form of apprenticeship

### Tools: Specifics on Code Playgrounds and Phaser and a Javascript framework
Bring out detail from the study to this section.

 - the media literacy practices of transfer between tools - similar to other studies - see guided participation papers

## Personal Plane
 This is explored in more depth in Chapter on Maps / Personal Plane.

 But to set the scene...
 Compare formal teaching of CT and CS with an approach based on a freer choice of patterns.

 Discuss the use of gdps as a gateway to other concepts as explored in CS in a more abstract, and more concrete direction [@erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019a]..

 The use of DPs hits a sweet spot as a "middle" level construct, (see Eriksson and Bjork)

 Rising to the concrete


## Social Plane - Guided Apprenticeship

### GDPs used as an organising tool

#### Task delegation

While there was no formal organising of groups in phase 2 and 3, the family bonds between parents and children created similar patterns of seeking validation, sharing planning. Although this was more the case for dyads working side-by-side on the same game, similar patterns existed for other configurations.

The opening vignette shows the name of a GDP as a way to communicate about the shared work of making a game.
The utterance by the child "Key Door Person" seemingly indicated that the child ceded responsibility to the adult. The child has judged it the level of complexity needed to add a new pattern into the code to be beyond her ability and delegates appropriately.


#### GDPs for Goal Setting and Prioritisation

The following exchange between participants Fi and Ma shows GDPs being used to organise future activity.
CONVERT INTO A TABLE

M: I’ve brought the music, and also we could just concentrate on one thing and just change that.
You know, keep working through.

F: Yeah.
 I think I want to get an enemy in - oh no - my person animated.

M: so you want to get your person animated that’s the main thing

M: Shall we concentrate on that and changing the platforms into something different?


F: Yeah.
M: Yeah?
F: I also want to make a theme tune.

M: Yeah it’s, that’s what I mean, you can’t just skip around like that.
F: hmmm
M: just cos it gets really overwhelming.
M: Yeah..? So…?

Long pause

M: Well I’ll have a look at the code and see if I can make sense of that.

This example shows the use of a number of game design patterns. At this stage of the design they have been

In addition, the child describes a feature that they want to see happen.

There is a sense here that the child may be picking activities to fit their strong suit of designing in other gui based environments. Leaving the father to piece things togethers. This is explored in the next section.

### GDPs and division of Labour

The implementation of some GDP involved the use of different tools and activites. For example, the design of a graphical element suited some learners and they depended on teh support of others to emplement those changes in code.

While the above interaction between Fi and Ma points to the parent doing the heavy lifting for code implementation, this was not always the case. Mi and Ne had a reverse relationship where the child would reluctantly implement the graphical changes in code but would pointedly not explain them seemingly taking pride in knowing something that her mother didn't.

### GDP and sustaining engagement

The process of adding in a new GDP to the game was often a sustaining activity.

#### GDPs and personal expression

Especially if part of the design allowed the expression of identity or a designed element - for example graphics, audio or a written entry.

This is supported by other research on digital making and motivation. CITATION HERE? - or in cultural discussion?  

#### GDPs propagation through peer activity

The process of adding levels was something that was spread predominately through one child's work to help others to add that features. The work of the child to add 21 levels to their own game served as a way to publicise this possibility. The role of that child as an expert in that design pattern, and their willingness to share their knowledge, shifted focus away from help from myself as a facilitator, or the instruction-based support documents.

### Interaction of GDPs with Playtesting as method

What was noticeable about - this in particular?
Desinging for others

### GDPs to support Iterative Design Practices

Well suited to build a repeated design practice.
Especially with starting documents,
Small changes had big effects.
Variable changes needed immediate testing.  

### Leading with GDP as a way to explore other Learning Dimensions

Under explored - but part of the thinking here. Perhaps move to discussion

The later Make Code cards which contained links to such patterns.

(see Eriksson and Bjork)

My end design highlights game patterns as a starting point for user interest and to draw participants in to other elements of learning dimensions. More abstract dimensions like systems thinking, and more concrete like coding concepts.
