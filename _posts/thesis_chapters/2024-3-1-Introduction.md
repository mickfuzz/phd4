## Introduction to broad context

In this thesis, I explore digital game making as a vehicle for inclusive pedagogy to coding fluency and participation in coding practices. The potential of digital game making is explored in depth in a review by Kafai and Burke [-@kafai_constructionist_2015]. The most prominent learning objective of making games in educational setting is to develop _coding and computing skills_. There are extensive studies on _game making to learn other subjects_ including maths, biology and chemistry but diverse examples exist. Game making can also develop social skills, self-reflection, cultural awareness and a range of technical abilities that allow participation in information society. They are also a powerful vehicle for exploring issues involving race, sex, social issues [@tekinbas_quest_2010]. While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research.

In line educational research which highlights the important of learning contexts, my own interest is on the process of the creation and evolution of game making cultures. The development of agency in the participation in game making communities is of particular interest to me. This interest stems in part from my desire to develop learner agency in my wider work on student project-based approaches in higher education and STEM education, and also in part from my past involvement in grass-roots music and campaigning projects. The next section is a summarise the root of this interest through an exploration of my personal context.


<!-- New software tools to make games which offer new pedagogical possibilities emerge regularly. Game playing practices and the opportunities provided by participation in wider communities also continue to evolve. For example, casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014]. My study, in part, asks how the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities can be brought into more structured educational environments.    -->




## Personal context


<!-- In 1995, as anyed recent graduate and new editor of a fanzine on the fledling electronic music scene centred around the Hulme venues of the Nia centre and New Adri, I was directed to this centre as it had the software Abiword which had the ability to print out rounded text boxes, a feature I thought would look pretty snazzy cut and pasted over over-photocopied backgrounds from 2000AD. No physical place in the UK seemed to better live out the counter-cultural, dystopian, cyberpunk ethic popularised by 2000AD and the author William Gibson. -->

In the middle of regenerated Hulme on the corner opposite the Birley fields campus is a squat unassuming building called the church of the Ascension. It is notable Apart from being  a site of sanctuary for the political refugee Viraj Mendis in a notable anti-deportation campaign of the 1980s, it was also the site of one of Europe's first electronic village halls, Hulme Community Computing Centre. Here a encouraged me to make a website a music fanzine I edited, giving me a print out on how to write HTML web pages and offering free space as part the projects website. This spirit of peer-learning combined with my desire to share the ethos of the DIY music scene fuelled many years of using the internet to promote unlicensed music events. In 1995, the internet, like Hulme, seemed to be a corporate free space, a space for oddballs, niche enthusiasts and more importantly activists. This period saw increasing alignment with the growth of the internet to link up activities of disparate political and cultural groups around gatherings international finance institution (IFIs). For me this culminated in helping to organise and promote an event for June 18th 1999. Similar carnival-themed events drew on the blue print of reclaim the streets mixing street blockaded by outdoor sound systems. While the site of street party and protests as a chaotic and inspirational environment has been explored [@carmo_reclaim_2012; @jordan_notes_2005].

I have been inspired by the possibilities of the party and protest movement as an inspirational site of learning. My involvement with the movement led me to help develop my internet publishing skills aligning myself with a broad network of media and internet activists centred around the Indymedia project [@pickard_united_2006]. On a personal level, my development as a media activist including but not limited to: graphic design; web page creation; computer programming; video editing; audio-visual events tech; and server maintenance was driven with motivation and support provided by people involved in that scene. The empowerment and education aspect of these networks and new uses of technology was something that I wanted to share with wider networks. To pay the bills I developed a specialism in  internet and media creation training and community as paid activity to support my environmental and migrant activism. One role was as a documentation writer for Floss manuals specialising in free and open sources tools for media and secure communications. Another of those roles was to set up run media centres for an activist social centre, Community Arts Northwest and People's Voice Media. As time developed, my activist activities aligned with arts techniques, integrating performance art and activist outreach particularly at film screenings. I enjoyed being part of a wide network of activists embracing playful, performance based actions and activism [@klepto_making_2004; @routledge_sensuous_2012].   

<!-- In 2001 later after working as a teacher, and being immersed in the party and protest scene I returned to Manchester and found a home in the Redbricks estate. Since 1999 local residents had rented a pre broadband T2 internet collection and used linux servers and snaking, self-made  network cables across roads, through roof spaces, to share this connection for affordable prices. Pete helped set up our connection for a home office for a new internet project called Beyond TV which was a pre-YouTube internet sharing site off shoot of the Undercurrent VHS magasine video activist project [^4].   -->

In 2011, it was revealed that the activist network I had been involved with were heavily infiltrated by police. Police infiltrators had also been undertaking a performance. The reality that the police and wider authorities had just been letting direct actions happen and even instigating some of them was stark.  While I had always been aware of the limits of our agency, I was still not ready for the extent of these revelations. My role in outreach for this movement became very uncomfortable as participation in this movement came with hidden risks. The ongoing news of police infiltration of activist networks[^1], and the use of personal and sexual relationships to further this disruption to the groups[^2], took a heavy toll on my mental health and my world outlook.

My work with social movements to take advantages of new opportunities created in part by community-driven technology to cause societal change had been met with a response from forces that were far better resources than we were. State and corporate bodies had used a diversity of means at their disposal: some legislative and bureaucratic; some underhand — notably the embrace, extend & extinguish [^3] tactic to counter to open source successes —; and some illegal means.


<!-- Project-based community and communications felt rewarding but the legs of community-based adult education were being cut off by the coalition government. -->

### A response of sorts

My response was to shift focus towards community work and training and documentation work with international networks and then eventually to informal learning of media creation with young people and families. While this move was a retreat from other domains in part driven by painful experiences outlined above, my shift of interest towards young people and family was a positive and strategic shift to align with my new role as a university tutor in education and as a new parent.

<!-- There are positive elements to this otherwise sad story. My experiences have helped focus my interests on how change can happen and happen quickly when new opportunities become available to a community eager to use them. They also caution against unrealistic expectations of systemic change when faced with opponents with deep pockets and extensive resources. I would like to communicate a pragmatic approach of finding the limits of your agency, strategically pushing against them, and cautiously observing what happens. An informed activism built on a critical view of the nature of the system in question. -->

My work in for FLOSS Manuals allowed me access to diverse international networks. These seemed one step away from grass roots organising  on the frontline but still informed by participatory and egalitarian methods. These networks included those advocating for Open Web and Free Culture, promoting Open Video and Video for Change movements. One thread of this work led me to work in partnership work with Mozilla and to gain awareness of the Webmaker education programme. Webmaker was more than a set of tools, Mozilla created workshops guides and in partnership with networks of informal educators in the US like Mouse, Hive Neworks and The New Youth City Learning Network. The motivation was to involve teens in being web literate through making web products inspired in part by Douglas Rushkoff's call for everyone to know at least a little bit of coding [@rushkoff_program_2010].

    And as we move into an increasingly digital reality, we must learn not just how to use programs but how to make them. In the emerging highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either create the software or you will be the software. It's really that simple: Program, or be programmed. [@rushkoff_program_2010].

This avenue offered a positive way to discuss the politics of independent communications and an empowerment agenda. The development of javascript based libraries like Popcorn.js also exposed the limits of my self-directed computing skills.
Thus it was strategic to I retrained with a masters in Computing and then a PGCE in Computing at Manchester Met. The rhetoric accompanying the launch of a new curriculum promised the ability to undertake game and media project production as a way to increase learners authentic real-world programming skills through creating authentic projects [@livingstone2010next].

During my PGCE year I found it challenging to bring in the kind of project based learning techniques to the classroom, a theme explored in this thesis. I did however manage to create a pilot scheme to teach javascript in playful ways, using Mozilla's webmaker tools and ethos, which I trialled in the classroom and wrote up as a dissertation and published the results as an addition to the Mozilla's online teaching resources. While the context of secondary schools within which I trained did not suit creative project based approaches, a new role Manchester Met University role doing community partnerships as part of their EdLab project [^4] did provide opportunities to pursue this work.

The turn to investigate game creation as a creative media project stemmed a consultation with home educators partnership work. To align with the interests of parents and children at the consultation asked if we could lead activities which drew on interest in games like Minecraft to start to do computer coding.

The shift from making web-based media to games made sense given the patch success I had had with web coding pages with school children. Rather than using media to mobilise and feed into social movements, games became a medium to explore and create as a playful educational experience. Both were grounded in self-expression, participatory culture and I was to find out both could use similar technology. To inform this work I returned to Mozilla's web developer resources to discover two step-by-step tutorials outlining how to game making in the browser using a javascript library called Phaser. I was able to combine my work using the code playground Thimble with the js library Phaser to create an potentially accessible toolset for young learners.

### Transition COMMENT

The use of new technologies by communities to achieve new aims. New technology can provide communities with tools to leverage new opportunities in a way which gives participants greater agency. Community-based approaches to learning can facilitate this process. The process of learn through undertaking creative media projects is explored in existing PBL literature but more work is needed which share effective practice. This study, in part, explores ways in which how the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities can be brought into more structured educational environments.

Conversely, changes happen within wider systems, which can push back to reverse the desired changes. My story acts as an example of a the kinds of 'risky' process of collective agency working on objectives that may run away to involve unforeseen outcomes [@edwards2009systemic, p. 200]. The link with this thesis here is that the process of community change can be rapid and transformational and that greater understanding of the processes involved are of value. On a personal level, while my views on the possibilities of new technology are now tempered with guilt and regret associated with not being wary enough of runaway effects of activities, I want to transcend some of the cultural paralysis my experiences have caused.  

## Conceptual Context


### The importance of understanding Projects and socio cultural and activist concepts of Activity

In this section I briefly explain CHAT as a suitable choice to explore this research based around a shared project.

I also problematise educational projects beyond the sometimes superficial take on educational project in schools with wider concepts derived from the socio cultural tradition.

While the kind of learning explored in this study may not traditionally be thought of as an activist project, I find synergies between activist conceptions of education and learning and my wider concerns in a modest but achievable way. Specifically as a desire to move beyond curricular and technical concepts of computational thinking to wider concerns based on empowerment [@lee_none_2016].   

In addition the wider framework of CHAT is optimistic but realistic in the focus on the possibility of change.

This process links back to my own feelings of entrapment, powerlessness and guilt after being involved with wider activist movements and projects. I want to be able to give detailed tools of critically analysis that do not paralyse but also do not unthinkingly evangelise social change in ways which may be unsafe or unrealistic.


### Addressing and disambiguating definitions of agency in education

To effectively answer RQ2 the concept of agency needs disambiguating.  

Agency and autonomy have disputed, often inter-related definitions or are often ill defined in studies [@huang_autonomy_2013; @matusov_mapping_2016].

See also feminist reconceptualisations of autonomy as agency[@abrams_autonomy_1998].

Concepts of agency are explored in more depth in chapter three, however a brief definition of agency in relation to informal education and this study is useful to ground the findings of the literature review.

Concepts of facilitating the development of agency in education have diverse threads [@matusov_mapping_2016]. These include: instrumental agency with a focus on developing capacities; effortful agency which enhances motivation and commitment; and authorial agency which involves agentic changes to the learning environment.

Matusov and colleagues critique effortful agency in education as focusing only on achieving goals predefined by educational establishments. Thus this summary focuses deepening an analysis on instrumental and authorial agency in relation to other research on the subject.

Matusov and colleagues (USEFUL BUT COMPLEX) outline many forms of agency to educational concepts.  [@matusov_mapping_2016]

The concept of instrumental agency to aid learner control is also useful as a way to reduce friction in learning designs. This more limited conception of agency as a way of getting things done is an attractive concept in designing for learners by designing out obstacles.

#### Instrumental and relational agency

Instrumental agency reflects a concept of agency as the ability to get things done. Conceptually these practical dimension involve removing aspects of negative liberty caused by technical barriers [@matusov_mapping_2016, p. 433].

In this sometimes technological view of educational environments teachers or facilitators can to increase agency by removing individual barriers to use. However, a more social view of instrumental agency also includes relational aspects where leaners are able to offer and request support [@edwards_steps_2005].


#### Authorial and transformative agency

Other takes of socio cultural school of research focus less on the individual and more on broader conceptions of activity. Stetsenko places agency in a socio-cultural theory between conceptions of humans as chiefly individualistic or instead as helpless bodies in wider cultural phenomenon   
[@stetsenko_critical_2020; @matusov_mapping_2016].


Matusov proposes authorial agency [@matusov_mapping_2016] as the concept of agency most aligned with x

DEFINE

As well as the work on Lave and Wegner on community based conceptions of agency,
Matusov bases much of the definition of authorial agency on existing work on transformational agency.

Hopwood's [-@hopwood_agency_2022] exploration of agency also focuses primarily on transformational agency and relational agency.

Specifically, TAS, TADS

TAS from Stetsenko addresses grand ideas of agency directly.
However the authour also grounds these grand ideas in concrete explorations, including play [@stetsenko_serious_2015]


Similarly while TADS addresses lofty ideas of "quote" they can be played out in smaller situations.

In exploring their differences Hopwood x and y.

Transformative agency [@engestrom2006development; @haapasaari_emergence_2016; @sannino_formative_2016].

For the purposes of this study, I agree with the view that the nature of agency as situated in context. Thus we do not say learners have or lack agency, as it is not a learner property independent of context  [@nieminen_what_2022].



## Educational Context

### Computing as a School Subject in the UK

The influential report "Next Gen: Transforming the UK into the world’s leading talent hub for the video games and visual effects industries" was focused on providing the UK games and animation industry with the talent needed to succeed [@livingstone_next_2011]. The top recommendations were to include computer science in core curriculum, introduce a new Computing GCSE (a general exam for 16 year olds before they progress to more specialised study) exam, offer bursaries for computing teachers and to implement well-supported use of games and visual animation in the school curriculum as a way to attract more young people to the subject.

The After the Reboot report [@waite_pedagogy_2017], returned to the subject of game making as a way of increasing engagement in the process of coding. The review highlighted several areas of promise which needed more research: using games for engagement, use of design patterns - a term explored later in this chapter - and the involvement of girls in coding and social and cultural aspects of coding. The "After the Reboot" report also contained concerning observations. The report found that girls, ethnic minorities, and students of lower socio-economic status were all less likely to take computing as a subject at GCSE level. Game making aligns well with the principles of inclusive practices and project-based learning (PBL). It provides: learner choice in projects which increases motivation; authentic and shareable project outcomes to encourage peer feedback and reflection;  iterative projects work supporting student mastery; and challenging goals and guidance in goal setting aiding self-regulation in learners.


<!-- The benefits of game making aligns with those of wider creative computing projects. There has been extensive publication on computing education and techniques aimed to support teachers often new to the subject. These include a new website with materials, including quick guides and writing around a set of 12 computing principles.
A lot of this literature is aimed at helping teachers in a classroom context and with a focus of explaining and exploring computing context.
MORE ON THIS - OTHER TIPS FROM NCCE AND LINKS TO RESOURCES.
BUT NOT TOO MUCH
While projects are mentioned as a principle that allows learners to deepen their understanding on computing concepts by putting them into practice. There is less on specifics of how teachers can support project work or indeed how to best develop resources to support project work in schools. -->
<!-- One of the recommended strategies is a Game Jam which focuses on real life issues.

-->


### Context of game making for educational purposes

While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research. New software tools to make games which offer new pedagogical possibilities emerge regularly. Game playing practices and the opportunities provided by participation in wider communities also continue to evolve. For example, casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014].




### Empowerment agenda of authentic computing aligning with personal motivations

Fluency with the focus on personal expression aligns with motivation of empowerment and equality of access not only to future employment but a broader participation on a digital society.

This agenda has parallels with other domains of participatory culture that I have been involved in.

- DIY music and protest event organisation
- Participatory media making for social and environmental causes
- Documentation writing using collaborative processes
- Creative coding

In summary, as a Computer teacher candidate I was drawn to the possibilities offered by a new technologies and the shifts in computer pedagogy. In the reality of schools that I taught in working within the constraints of the curriculum, exams and competing pressures for time worked together to prevent the kind of authentic activities that first attracted me.

However, a new position as a project work for EdLab allowed me the ability to explore this outside of the classroom in more innovative programs and partnerships.

- Hive Manchester and Code Club
- Coder Dojo
- Creative coding at Manchester Libraries
- Speciality training for PGCE and Primary Education programmes
- Home education workshop in Manchester Met in partnership with students as part of Edlab and other PBL courses.

#### Authenticity as Empowering

Later in this thesis I problematise the use of the work authentic in learning [@lee_none_2016]. In this introduction I refer making games that will be played by audience of friends and family and using tools used beyond the scope of education, professional communities.  

I was attracted and received positive feedback from the process of lifting the lid on the specifics of authentic tools computing. The tools created by Mozilla to investigate and to remix HTML pages scaffolded the experiences of new learners and paralleled  my own early experiences of self-expression through hacking a new technology.

In additions, the practices of code patching and remixing are authentic skills used by professional coders who find and combine existing code libraries rather than coding everything from scratch.

My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics and Scratch.

FIND SUPPORT FROM MOZILLA WHITE PAPER - JUSTIFY EFFORT OF JS AS A STARTING LANGUAGE

In additions the process of making a game for peers is authentic for young people.

Aligning with the activities of Nicola Whitton exploring the rules and components of games in a playful way.

Javascript is an authentic language, core the web. Phaser is a professional and enthusiast framework. Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals.

In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity and thus an ability.

#### Authentic web technology

The motivation was to align to authentic web technology due to my previous experience. The reason for working with code this authentic bears exploration. Characteristics of broader dimensions of authenticity of tools and processes in learning environments are explored in the literature review. A brief summary being: similarity to workplace settings; facilitating activity which serves a need of participants; an ability to showcased resulting work to an audience [@shaffer_thick_1999; @warr_bridging_2020]. While my choice of open source digital tools allowed for a high level of aligning with professional practices, it was also potentially complex in terms of use of tools. In part my motivation for choice of code language (Javascript, Phaser) was driven by desire to align with common workplace practices and to be potentially extensible for future student-led web projects.

### Project Based Learning and Inclusion

Contemporary understandings of inclusion go beyond SEND (special educational needs and disabilities) issues to include cultural exclusion which may include dimensions of race, gender or other cultural factors. Recent studies study the use of games and playful techniques to overcome exclusion from the culture of computing [@kafai_diversifying_2017; @kafai_beyond_2014]. If students feel excluded from school culture then making bridges to home cultures is vital. One way to make those connections to home cultures is to allow for more choice of what can be incorporated into computing projects. The benefits of game making as a form of project-based learning (PBL) also align with a teaching framework focused on inclusion called Universal Design for Learning (UDL)[@basham_understanding_2013]. While an analysis of the synergies between PBL and UDL is beyond the remit of this chapter, key characteristics of game making as an educational activity align well with both UDL and project-based approaches. The following sections give three examples.


The term inclusion in education no longer addresses solely children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) but also examines barriers of culture and other exclusionary elements of the school environment and discourse [@black-hawkins_achievement_2008]. The issue of alienation from the culture of computing in schools has been identified as an issue of concern especially for girls and some ethnic minorities [@the_royal_society_after_2017]. To be inclusive schools and teachers must identify both traditional SEND issues and wider cultural barriers to participation in computing classrooms and help student overcome them. Beyond the important technical accessibility tools and assistive learning technologies - for example text in different sizes, screen readers - a diversity for inclusive teaching strategies are also needed.


<!-- The next section deals with inclusive
Web-based or software activities include game making, meme creation, hobby website creation or making storytelling adventures. Incorporating materials from narrative forms like books, films, games and social media content into computing projects increases the ability for learners to bring their own interests into the mix. However, while the range of materials and possible creative projects is exciting and full for promise for computing teachers, it is not always clear how to best approach these opportunities from an educational point of view. This chapter will explore teaching and learning approaches to increase learner engagement with computing, firstly by defining and exploring concrete approaches, and then by sharing useful classroom tactics.
 pedagogy but Florian and BH make a distinction with other similar terms does this need to be explored?  -->

<!-- Researchers Black-Hawkins and Florian [-@black-hawkins_classroom_2012] note that many teachers report lacking the knowledge to effectively teach children with SEND issues.  -->

One way to address SEND issues is to use differentiation to adapt a the standard lesson plan for learners needing special support. However this view of a standard, optimal learner pathway is not supported by recent research in neurodiversity, which suggests there is no one optimal way for students to learn. Inclusive pedagogies take a different approach to differentiation which places more power in the hands of learners to choose the path that is most appropriate for them. All students are given a greater choice of materials and activities from the start suiting the varied needs of all students. This has the benefit of removing stigmatisation of some learners having to undertake work that seen to be created for _low-achieving_ students. These principles - among others - are presented in a framework called Universal Design for Learning (UDL).


Rather than designing separate activities and support for learners with different educational needs in the classroom - often labelled accommodations for disability - UDL facilitates learners to choose a learning pathway that suits their individual abilities and learning strategies.

UDL places great value on the personal relevance, choice and authenticity of learning experiences. As a way to encourage engagement UDL suggests setting choices of concrete learning goals that are relevant to the learners. This learner-led approach is very different to a traditional-instruction based, directive approach to teaching. The diverse learning pathways offered can be unfamiliar for both teachers and for students. The UDL guidelines recognise this and provide information to support teachers to implement them. As educators, we may need to build our own abilities and familiarity with learner-led approaches as well as growing the autonomy of our students.  

<!-- Students can then be supported in the discovery and recording of the underlying concepts after undertaking activities. -->
<!-- ### Case Study - Exploring Universal Design for Learning in Context -->
One area of UDL that teachers can implement straightforwardly is to represent concepts in the classroom in a diversity of ways. In a related study, researchers Cook and colleagues [@cook_using_2016] explored the alignment of UDL with another framework, CRA, which consists of a three stage model to support learners to develop concepts [@fyfe_concreteness_2014].


The researchers outline how the three stages of CRA (Concrete, Representational and Abstract) align with key UDL principles, most specifically multiple ways to represent knowledge to aid learner perception and comprehension. In short, first teachers introduce a physical, concrete model of the concept, then progress to iconic forms, for example graphics or pictures; finally learners work with more abstract models of the concept. The CRA framework is an example of concept popular in Mathematics research and practice called Concreteness Fading where concepts are introduced in concrete examples and then learners are supported to understand and represent them in more abstract ways.

When reading about different approaches to teaching computing the terms concrete and abstract are used commonly. For example the concrete practice of coding is a good way for learners to work with more abstract computing concepts. The following section explores the utility of these terms to explore inclusive approaches to teaching especially in relation to an understanding of Computational Thinking.






## Context of digital making and home media use

The context of these communities is important to situate the relevance of this study. These contexts are explored in summary. In the following chapter some of the pedagogies, e.g. tinkering, are explored in more depth.


Building on the concept of participatory culture [@jenkins_confronting_2009], where x and y, there are several streams of activity that are important to reference as foundational context for this study.

The work of Livingstone is foundational in the area of home learning of digital technologies[@livingstone_digital_2018].

Research exploring home game playing and digital activity uncovers material that families may bring into a non-formal game making process.

Messing around and affinity groups. Ito's work on  and naturalistic studies of digital use and creativity in the home including the value of informal playing around [@ito_connected_2013-1; @ito_hanging_2010], and Gee and the process of tapping into affinity groups and affinity spaces [@gee_what_2004].  Gee's (2004b) work on games and associated culture as learning experiences is founded on his understanding of how the engender a shared discourse and emerging identities .

Kafai and Burke's extensive work proposes applying the power of Gee's work around the game playing to game making [@kafai_connected_2016, p. 56].

In addition, maker culture more generally is relevant due to the alignment with tinkering as educational practice in stem education, supported by family involvement and brokering of experiences. The details of tinkering as a pedagogical practice are explored in more detail in the literature review of this thesis.



### Context of Home Education and family learning

The move to family learning as a context suited the trajectory of my interests and the opportunities available as part of University context.

Many professional programmers began with support provided by family.

Barron and Livingstone have outlined the advantages and processes involved in family involvement of technology use and learning in the home. There is clearly an inequality of access to these well paid profession that the development of the computing curriculum and the skills based and creative process focus that was part of the initial narrative is laudable the aims of equality.

However the practical and and cultural difficulties of undertaking a project-based approach withing the curriculum are significant. Factors of difficulties associated with technology projects compound difficulties.

In this research I made the decisions not to focus on the adaptation  of a  informal club approach to the restrictions of in-school classes but rather instead to embrace key elements of it and to explore processes in situ. While the context of home education is not a core to the goals of this research it is important to situate this study accurately.

**Outline of the home eduction context of this study:** The processes and motivations driving of home education are varied [@fensham-smith_invisible_2021]. Classic ideas of reasons for HE include pedagogy and ideology [@galen_home_1991] [@rothermel_can_2003], and often both. My involvement with home ed networks stemmed from University outreach work. In the following section I draw on relevant research to identify characteristics and motivations of the networks and families that I tapped into.

- Unschooling, Holt, drawing out interests of children in everyday activities and facilitating learning around that [@gray_challenges_2013]
- Webs of learning Illich - home ed families active in identifying networks to tap into [@doroudi_relevance_2023] has a relevance with social networking groups and email lists used by home educators to share and align activities.

### On Retro Gaming

One of the reasons that I was interested to shift to game making was the potential that seemed to be present for intergenerational work based around retro gaming based on its place in public memory [@heineman_public_nodate]. The place in public memory of retro games is complex but for older participants, the effect of nostalgia is significant.

What era and technologies constitute retro games can be disputed, however for this study I use a definition of early arcade games from the 1970s and early 1980s and early generation of home consoles Atari 2600, Nes, Snes and Megadrive before the advent of 3D graphics.

Retro games have a particular aesthetic driven by graphical limitations and the simplified game mechanics which are
due to the limited capabilities of the hardware and storage space involved. These limits suit the capabilities of the chosen design tool Phaser.js.

### Studies with pedagogies addressing barriers to do with identity and computer cultures

**Studies exploring identity and barriers to participation**

Game making is thus a suitable mediumn to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

Issues of identities and barriers have been explored in relation to gender in terms of game making in several studies.
REWRITE WITH CORRECT CITATIONS - ALSO INCLUDE THE GAME TESTERS OF BLACK STUDENTS.   

**Gender related identities**

The Girls Creating Games programme which asked similar questions concerning the impact of a Flash-based game programme on computer proficiency and desire to continue with computer studies Denner, 2007). Findings were again mixed but encouraging in some areas. While there was no increase in desire to persue computing, there were marked increases in computer related confidence, ability and a decrease in gender stereo typing around computer use.

The issues of gender stereo-typing and identity in relation to computers were explored by Pelletier as part of the Making Games project using the Mission Maker software 2008).

<!-- Data was recorded from two UK schools in an 18 month after school programme. Pelletier draws on the work of Butler 1988) to caution against overdue influence of a set conception of gender or cultural stereotypes, seeing gender as a personal and flexible product of continuing activities and interactions. In this study, she explored the promise of the process of game design and the analysis of gaming habits as a platform and set of tools for young participants to explore and construct their gender identity over time. This area is a rich seam to explore and a more recent study by Fisher and Jenson critically explored diverse themes through a summer game making programme 2017). Emerging issues included pinkification, marginalisation and exclusions of women from game cultures, sexualisation and harassment. -->

Kafai and Burke also address the issues of gender identities and game design 2014). They propose that we ask not *How can we bring girls into the game making clubhouse* but rather *How can we build new clubhouses suitable for the interests of girls*. Two of the playful elements they suggest are textiles related technology and the promotion of more collaborative online spaces as opposed to technology competitions.


- girl's low self-confidence in the area of computing compared to their ability [@beyer_gender_2003; @margolis_unlocking_2002]

**Research**
Extensive research by Roberson on game making in schools measured gender differences in performance and attitudes to game making and computing in pre post tests [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_influence_2013].  

The findings were mixed as while girls outperformed boys in use of computational structures, neither gender ended the programme with a greater desire to learn more about computers in the future.

The Girls Creating Games programme which asked similar questions concerning the impact of a Flash-based game programme on computer proficiency and desire to continue with computer studies [@denner_girls_2007] . Findings were again mixed but encouraging in some areas. While there was no increase in desire to persue computing, there were marked increases in computer related confidence, ability and a decrease in gender stereo typing around computer use.

Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  



**Race related identities**

In study by Thayter and Ko [@thayer_barriers_2017] the work of Margolis et al is analysed using concepts from communities of practice, type of barriers, and personal obstacles [@margolis_stuck_2008;]

    Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race and Computing by Margolis, Estrella, et al. [ 12] examined the racial gap in high school CS, finding barriers that included lack of access to classes (formal boundary), cultural expectations on who the classes were for, feelings of isolation in classes, divisions within classes between those who “have it or don’t have it” (informal boundaries), and lack of social support(personal obstacle). Additional studies found participation and success in computing programs depended on background experience [ 2, 27 ], comfort level [ 27 ], sense of belonging and stereotypes (dis proportionately negatively affecting women) [ 2 , 5, 10, 16 ], view of self as an “insider” [21], and believed role of luck [27]

I adopt a similar approach but use the language of AT contradictions, barriers and tensions.

### Specialist coding tools and computational kits

There may software and hardware kits aimed at novice coders and in particular younger audience [@yu_survey_2018].

- Remix as a feature: [@amanullah_evaluating_2019]
- Online log in
- library of assets to speed up creation
- In built asset authoring tools.

Game star Mechanic added quest ability, and a narrative set in a steam punk aesthetic. Of interst to this study are the motivational use of narrative, and accompanying resources which help analysis of game design patterns and systems based challenges.

### Family Making - WHAT IN PARTICULAR TO EXPLORE ?

Roque's work is founded on sociocultural / situated understandings of learning and brings it into a non-formal learning environment. A key question she asks is how can facilitators help develop participation in community activities [@roqueBecomingFacilitatorsCreative2018].
I extend this in this study, how can the learning design contribute?


It is of value to explore the community aspect...

### Mozilla, Webmaking and code playgrounds

#### Webmaking

A Mozilla white paper [@mozilla_foundation_webmaker_2014] outlines the power of exploring web technology as an empowering activity. My own work in this area has been informed by work developing teaching materials for the Mozilla Foundation as part of the Teach the Web programme.

 <!-- This programme introduced a broad set of competencies name Web Literacies including; digital literacy
- web literacy - narrower
- webmaker - and more specific affordances of key web based coding and exploring tools -->

Javascript is an authentic language, core to modern web pages and applications.  

I contributed to the Mozilla teach the web programme by writing a course called Quacking Javascript. My report on the underlying pedagogical approach outlines the following possibilities; playful approach, use of online games, use of popular culture references to increase engagement [@chesterman_webmaking_2015].  

#### Code playgrounds

Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals. In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity and thus an ability . My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics.

MOVE TO LR.
The process of running web code can be complicated by setting up a server environment locally to test and then finding a live webserver and the complexity of transferring files to the server via FTP/SSH processes. . Code playground allow users to circumvent such problems. While originally designed more for problem solving, a service more recent code playgrounds provide is to act as a more permanent host for web projects.  

In their brand style and selected  picks of projects, many code playgrounds celebrate and encourage a playful spirit of creativity and sharing.

<!-- NOTE  - I loved FTP and feel nostalgic? perhaps rfer back to that in conclusion? -->

<!-- DROPPED -  There are strong parallels in this presentation to that Scratch community and to the sharing ethos integral to the maker-movement (explored in Lit Review). The interplay between play and work via shared experimentation is developed further in a later discussion chapter. -->

#### Other online asset creation tools

There are other ways to create assets online. Piskel is a pixel graphics editor, audio creation of assets. These tools are provided by a mix of enthusiast coders and communites of game makers. ### Mozilla, Webmaking and code playgrounds

#### Phaser.js

While the Webmaker program was discontinued and the end of a funding cycle, ongoing core work of Mozilla to provide resources for webdevelopers. One strand of this is game development using javascript  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games

Mozilla chose phaser as a javascript library/ framework (see Glossary). Phaser is a javascript framework embedded in html page. Unlike many game making tools this tools set can be extended to other kinds of projects and is a professional and foundational toolset used to build the majority of websites and many phone applications.

#### Summary of authenticity- COMMENT OR MOVE

Javascript as coding language, Phaser as a game making framework and Glitch as a code environment, are highly authentic and used by both professional coders and enthusiasts alike.



## Review of relevant barriers to participating in coding practices emerging in the literature

<!-- NOTE - THIS IS ALSO IN THE DESIGN CHAPTER
CHOOSE CAREFULLY WHERE TO PUT THE RESULTS. -->


This section draws on concepts of the introductory section to review existing research on digital making to identify barriers to participation in digital making and in particular coding practices.

<!-- NOTE: there is overlap here with contextual factors in the introduction and with the new direction of chapter 4 - probably move a lot of this.  

This section then which summarises existing research in this area needs a clear and different focus.
-->

The focus of this review is to identify broad streams and currents in research. The next section examines research on pedagogical responses.

Here, the term barrier is used in a general way. In the next chapter it will be examined with greater criticality.


#### Barrier: Difficulties in learning to program

Summary here [@gomes2007learning] [@joao_cross-analysis_2019]. and here

    <!-- Through a literature review on this topic, we aim to organize and   systematize the main difficulties into four dimensions of analysis: (i) subject and complexity of languages; (ii) technologies and applications; (iii) teachers and teaching methodologies; and (iv) pupils’ skills[@joao_cross-analysis_2019] -->

In particular, the dilemma between more authentic languages and block based approaches [@joao_cross-analysis_2019].

More literature which examines the complexity of language and development environments should be found here.

Complexity of syntax and problem of leading with syntax [@gomes2007learning]

Issues of needing levels of abstraction in learning programming [@gomes2007learning].

#### Barrier: Paucity on research on designing for face to face learning communities of novice game makers - MOVE?

<!-- As Amy Bruckman pointed out, "tools are not enough... Tools are effectively constructionist only when they are embedded in a constructionist culture." (Bruckman, 1998, pp. 51-52) -->

There is limited research on how to create learning communities making games for educational purposes. Existing research [@xiao_fostering_2007] has close parallels with project approaches and has a focus on fostering online collaboration and resources sharing.

Many popular and well researched online communities exist [scratch, itch.io, new grounds](Bruckman).

However researchers [@roque_family_2016] highlighted the limitations of accessibility of online participatory culture. In response Roque [@roque_family_2016]  FCL study addressed it with face to face session with help from family members.  

Sharing practice for researchers and practitioners is complicated. The results are often too abstract to be useful or easily understood by practitioners or too concrete to replicate.  

Notable exceptions include design pattern collections and design heuristics like that of Brennan and Silverman [@resnick_reflections_2005]

### Barrier - limited leaner choice in process

Authors note that UMC and the value of project based exploration can clash with classroom culture driven by curriculum goals.

  "Constructionist learning experiences are often designed to give the learner agency in the activity, encouraging exploration throughout the process of constructing public and shareable artifacts [16, 26]. The open-endedness can be difficult to adhere to when used in a context where there are specific learning objectives or when trying to introduce new conceptual material or practices. Noss & Hoyles [24] call this the Play Paradox, an inherent tension between supporting a freedom of exploration while constraining the activity to ensure specific concepts or practices are encountered."

Quote from [@franklin_analysis_2020]


### Cultural / Identity barriers to participation in ...

**Barriers to participation**

Develop from introduction, move to a overview of literature which addresses  barriers in participation in coding communities from literature.

The focus of this review is to identify broad streams and currents in research.


#### Barrier - Identity and computer cultures

Early work from Papert and Turkle addresses cultural barriers to computing culture [-@papert_epistemological_1990]. The distinction between hard and soft approaches to learning is explored particularly in studies refuting conceptions that there is a right way to do computer coding. In this context, the hard approach infers a top-down perspective, highlighting advance planning and logical deconstruction of large problems. Papert and Turkle identify the privileging of abstract thinking over concrete approaches in classroom teaching a tendency which is mirrored by recent conceptions and advancement of computational thinking as teaching ideology [@wing_computational_2008].

Paper and Turkle locate different, softer but equally effective coding strategies. Soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner-directed connection with the materials or digital artefacts involved. The learner is presented as adapting a familiar set of concepts and processes to new situations and challenges as they arise as a 'tinker' might use well worn tools to skilfully bodge a repair job [@papert_childrens_1993, p. 143].

Kafai and Peppler also address the issues of gender identities and game design [@kafai_beyond_2014] asking how to create new communities and learning environments which align with values of participants rather than aiming to break into existing ones. They propose that we ask not *How can we bring girls into the game making clubhouse* but rather *How can we build new clubhouses suitable for the interests of girls*. Two of the playful elements they suggest are textiles related technology and the promotion of more collaborative online spaces as opposed to technology competitions.

<!-- #### Barrier - Unfamiliarity with design process due to instruction based schooling systems

 - Barriers in using support material for code examples- mapping, understanding, [@wang_novices_2021]

### Barrier - unfamiliarity with support practices

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].




 <!-- Low floors: a tool that is intuitive enough to allow new users to acclimate to it gradually and with a degree of confidence.
 High ceilings: a tool that also allows more experienced users to create constructs (in this case, video games) that can grow increasingly complex and nuanced as one’s own proficiency increases.
 Wide walls: a tool that—in addition to low floors and high ceilings—allows its users to create a wide range a constructs, letting users tap into elements of personal experience as well as popular culture to design and develop something entirely unique and representative of their own interests and backgrounds.

## Summary of the thesis motivation and structure

### Recap of motivation

A motivation is to better understand my practice as an activist, community worker and educator.

While I am wary of runaway objects, I am still active in a community and university setting.

An understanding of this controlled experiment in creating culture can shed light on previous work.

Theories of situated learning view transmission of educational practice as a thorny problem as the process of learning is dependant on many contextual factors.

Thus why would this study based on observations of one context be of use?
Thoughts:  
  - similar contexts exist
  - underlying treads may emerge which may transcend context  

### Gaps in existing research / Contribution to knowledge of this thesis

**Gaps in research**
- Kafai's review on game making research is thin in cultural terms.
- Not many addressing the explicit intention to create a community.  
- Game design patterns emerged in this research as fruitful and is under researched



**Other thoughts on thesis**

This research is valid in the following ways:

- generative nature of research. It has created teaching resources
- the detail of game making pedagogy, suitable for other researcher and Teachers
- tools are novel - media practices are situated, thus will differ with technology
- application of guided participation as lens to this domain
- something about methods using 360 and screen capture?



### Research Questions

- What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to game coding and design?
<!-- - What pedagogical factors are significant to support novices learning coding, particularly in game making contexts? -->
- How can participants build agency in an evolving community of game makers?
- How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?


### Chapter outline

As has been outlined in this introduction the a leading thread of the thesis is my desire to better understand my own experience as a facilitator of learners creating media and digital products in relation with existing research. This chapter has been structured around key contextual factors that have spurred this inquiry and which have emerged from observational research and integrating existing theoretical understandings in this area. While the immediate goal of understanding learning happening in temporary informal environments of learning coding, the findings have implications that of interest to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners who are looking to nurture creative and/or technical design practices in novice learners.  

In line with a situated view of learning the details of process of coding are important. Thus one of the challenges of this work is to explore the details to a non-expert audience. While the literature review will begin to disambiguate some of the terms used in the thesis there is in addition a glossary which outlines short definitions of technical terms used. The glossary is included as an appendix to this study and a summary table is present as an introductory section to the literature review.

The literature review begins the exploration of the key themes and threads that are integral to the findings of this study. These include: authenticity in project based approaches; nature of informal settings in particular home education; barriers to participation in digital making; pedagogies to create inclusive learning environments and to help young people learn computer coding. To follow I outline the theoretical framework and the key methodologies of this study. I explain how the design based research (DBR) aligns well with the aims of the research questions and the use of concepts from the socio cultural school and the leading approach of third generation activity theory (3GAT).

<!-- In doing so I explore the direction of travel of 3GAT and increasing synergies with DBR as methodologies which suit both intervention by researchers into the learning environment being studies and corresponding input by research participants in the resulting design. -->

Chapter three starts with a summary of key concepts aligned with the theoretical framework to aid the analysis of data gathered. This include: the iterative and mutually created and emergent nature of the resources and processes that were created and adopted; identifying a unit of analysis; and transformative conceptions of agency. In the second part of the chapter, I outline the process of how data was gathered, processed and collected using screen capture and 360 cameras. I explore the challenge of gathering large amounts of research data and resulting prioritisation that resulted.   

 <!-- which had been inspired by partnership work between EdLab and the Biosocial Lab -->

Chapter four outlines the learning design that emerged from the research process. To explore emerging tensions in design in a way which communicates relevant context, I outline four conflicts in interrelated activity systems using the terminology of third generation activity theory (3GAT). This chapter discussion begins with an exploration of the tools used through the lens of authenticity. It continues by covering the mutual nature of the evolution of the design, and ends with a synthesis to initial barriers to engaging in game making practices and initial interventions to address them.

Chapter five focuses on the implementation of individual game design patterns (GDPs) and in doing so addresses how data gathered informs thinking on the research question - _how can game design patterns support the development of coding practices by novices_?
This chapter begins by re-examining of game design patterns and game play design patterns in the context of a community of novice coders. Following this a vignette of parent child interaction in game making process introduces an overview of interactions of that pair to help contextualise findings. The chapter then undertakes a systematic analysis of the use of game design patterns by participants drawing on detailed observations of practice. A discussion section explores implications and observations from these findings in relation to existing research and concepts.

Chapter six outline the use of inclusive pedagogical methods that helped participants become part of an emerging community of game makers. It explores the role of the design of games and the surrounding communities that build up around games to support an nurture the development of player identities. The process is shown to have beneficial effects in supporting the creative process. I explore the use of a process drama to draw on their existing knowledge and encourages them to put this into practice via a playful fictional scenario.

Chapter seven concludes the thesis with a final discussion on the significance of my findings in line with other research and discusses the limitations of this research and identifies areas for future work.

### Link to next chapter

It is worth noting at this stage that the process of being guided by personal interests, those of participants and creating and designing
This chapter has explored the context of HE, informal science learning and specifically computer coding and game making. The pedagogies of those areas are explored in the next chapter.
