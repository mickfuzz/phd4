### Visual asset creation and selection   

- Mi's interactions around graphics creation - write up transcript
- Mi's exploration in others.

There was a high degree of personal expression through interaction with the process of creating visual assets in particular.

NOTE THE NEXT SECTION IS QUITE GENERAL MOVE TO START OF THIS SECTION OR LIT REVIEW?
The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;]

In this exerpt parent Mi has spent

    St:  That's Good!
    Mi: Oh do you like it?
    St: Yeah
    Mi: Thank you. I'm very proud of it. Concentrated extremely hard. The thing is, you can get quite consumed doing things like this can't you?
    St: Yeah
    Mi: That's the problem at home I get a bit kind of lost. I can't get the knack of some things. It takes me so long to get it. I'm like  so excited.   
    - Both laugh.
    St: So are you going to do bits at home? When the kids are..
    Mi: I tried and I lost it all. And you know when you just completely... And even Ne didn't know so I just ... what a shame..  hours ....
    Laughs

    Mi - Lost time. Never mind.  We live and we learn.   

    Mi – We’re finished.

    Mi  - Right what’s next? Now I’m an expert pixel?
    Mi – Now I have to figure out how to get it in there don’t I? Without losing it I’ll be very upset.
    St – Have you saved it?
    Mi – No I’ve not saved it.
    St – Save there. (points to relevant button on screen)

We can see Mi cultivating a sense of ownership over the graphical element that she has created. There is also the development of a growing sense of competency in this area of asset design.


#### Other examples of asset creation allowing personal expression

**Repurposing graphical assets  in a playful way**

Pair Sh and Th used a graphic of a cute dog as the background of their game.  

- playing around the graphic - covering it over and revealing it

The child expressed a lot of positive regard to this dog and used it a way to stimulate conversation about their home interest in dogs during play testing.
- participant self-expression and a conversational prompt to other during sharing of the game

The subject was completely unrelated to the previously stated theme of the game.
It may be the parent knew this was a way to sustain involvement and interest.

These interactions re sometimes playful, and sometimes chance to share something serious. It allows young person to talk about dogs and their love of dogs. Even at one point that they used to have two and one died.

**Audio assets**
In the second iteration of glitch game club participants were introduced to tools to create sounds and a free audio resource repository. This allowed for rapid, broad strokes personal expression in a similar way to the use of graphical elements.
Examples? Ru and Ro ? in one of the later weeks?

#### Discussion - on assets and participation

Cultural interactions seem to be able to motivate and sustain other interpersonal activity which may be experienced as work.
This is supported by other research on digital making and motivation. CITATION HERE? - or in cultural discussion?  

**Tangled nature of graphics and narrative in this design**
In the data analysed, young people


**Limitation of asset work as a GDP**
Note the limits of this interpretation.
While the reinterpretation of the MDA framework into a menu of GDP is practical for the elements that they want to change, it is not strictly a pattern to be implemented here.
A tension here to be briefly explored or noted to explore later.
