## Introduction

PURPOSE & GAPS - ADD IN EACH SECTION.

This chapter deepens the analysis and discussion on RQ2 regarding the potential uses of gameplay design patterns (GDP) and concludes with an analysis and discussion on RQ3, addressing reflections on participant agency. Chapter 6 presented findings on the different uses of gameplay design patterns (GDP) using three foci of analysis: personal, social, and cultural activity. To begin, this chapter discusses these findings in relation to existing relevant research. Part one specifically addresses the complexities of the abstract and concrete dimensions of computing education using a concept from design research that explores the value of gameplay design patterns as an intermediate-level, pedagogical framework.  

Part two shifts focus away from individual conceptions of knowledge and skill to examine the broader empowerment-related motivations driving this study. The goal here is to address gaps in the existing landscape of CGD&P research via an application of socio-cultural conceptions of agency. To begin this process, I undertake an interpretation of shifting forms of agency grounded in the data explored in the last chapter.

<!-- The purpose here is to ground this discussion of the study's emergent cultural and interpersonal activity within the context of ongoing explorations into theoretical and practical applications of agency in socio-cultural research circles.  -->

To achieve this, I begin with an exploration of the study’s findings in relation to instrumental and transformative agency and the concept of mediation in CHAT. As a way to address cultural development in more depth, particularly the development of learner identities within the research activities, I develop an interpretation of relational agency drawing on Rogoff and Gutiérrez's [@gutierrez_cultural_2003] concept of learner repertoires. To present a holistic picture of the complex cultural activity recorded in the research data, this discussion briefly addresses the wider aspects of the learning design.  However, it concludes with a proposed contribution suggesting that a collection of GDPs can help participants and facilitators as both as component features of emerging game making repertoires and as a orienting framework to increase the inclusive characteristics of the learning environment.  

The final part of this chapter returns to gaps in the research landscape and outlines an applied computing pedagogy structured around the use of GDPs.

An exploration of metaphors that synthesise significant features of the learning design which influence dimensions of agency.

As framework is developed via a utopian and utilitarian approach to design-based research and formative interventions. As such, it communicates insights  for equity and diversity via practical concerns to inform future recommendations for practice.  


<!-- This chapter has three main sections:

1. Rising to concrete ; Conceptions of abstract and concrete present in computing and digital making research: ultimately, proposing design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework compared to computational thinking.

<!-- - MOVE TO CONCLUSION? metaphors / frameworks to envisage affordences and particpant agency in CHAT framework. and why this is useful for facilitators and as an accessibel way to share findings. -->




<!-- **more intro material**

The chapter contains a discussion on wider concerns of designing for learner agency. Here I synthesise analysis on processes which support learners to develop agency in this game making community
(and the role of different levels of authenticity?)

This section takes a step back to explore the wider perspectives of the findings beyond the immediate context to digital making and project based approaches and understandings of design patterns in educational contexts.

An underlying proposal of this thesis is the development of  learner agency can be facilitated by designing effective learning environments. To do this I draw on key forms of developmental agency explored in Chapter 3.

This section synthesises findings learner agency in relation to existing conceptions of agency in other research.

This section explores these academic conceptions in a playful way using relatable metaphors from related research. The aim of this playful/relatable approach is to aid the situation of later recommendations for researchers and educators working in this area in an accessible way. -->

<!-- **Intro to section** -->

The tension between abstract and concrete dimension of the process of learning to program runs as a theme through the literature of the domain of computer game design and programming (CGD&P) (see Chapter 2). Yet, the field is still lacking in depth in terms of specific pedagogies which explore the complexities of conceptions of abstraction. Complexities which include areas of... computational thinking; the role of levels of abstraction for teachers and learners; and the value of epistemological pluralism as a way to value concrete approaches. To address this this chapter explores these characteristics in relation to the data surfaced in Chapters 5 and 6 of this thesis. The section concludes with a proposal of GDPs as pedagogical constructs located between abstract and concrete poles of the learning experience and an exploration of their utility for educational designers, researchers and for participants. Finally, a technical pedagogical structure is advanced and given an term of _remix enabled elective pattern patching_ (REEPP)

### Conceptions of abstraction in the research field

<!-- CHECK THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS CONCEPT IN THESIS. -->


Before exploring dimensions of abstraction and concreteness in the use of GDPs within context of computing education by revisiting relevant pedagogies outlined in Chapter 2, it is of value to revisit relevant framings which justify the utility of such exploration. Firstly, following Hook [-@hook_strong_2012], Eriksson et al. [-@eriksson_using_2019], in their use of a curated collection of GDPs to structure game design, framed design patterns as a form of intermediate-level concept, between the detail of concrete implementation and more general theories. The value of the intermediate nature of the knowledge generated is to serve the replicability and generalisation of research work. Similarly, in activity theory, specifically in formative interventions, the research process and the evolving design involve a process of _rising to the concrete_. This analytical process involves identifying from concrete data an abstraction of interest and utility and leveraging the power of this concept to generate distinct concrete instantiations of it. Thus this research advances the use of GDPs as both a form on intermediate learning design principle (explored in Chapter 5) and as an analytical germ cell which is manifested in varied motivational and mediational forms (Chapter 6).

**Revisiting concepts of abstraction in foundational computing education research**

Chapter 2 explores definitions of computational thinking varying in degrees of abstraction or application. Two notably interpretations include Wing's [-@wing_computational_2006] focus on abstraction encompassing as overarching computing principles and high level structural design approaches, and Resnick and Brennan's [-@brennan_new_2012] more applied approach including _computational practices_ and perspectives. This applied approach draws on the legacy of Papert and Turkle's [-@papert_epistemological_1990] research on diversity in coding approaches to counter potentially alienating abstract approaches. Framed as bricolage, concrete coding approaches included an iterative approach, proximity to the code and strong links between function and form, and maintaining closer contact with a concrete sense of the outcomes even at the expense of programming efficiency or neatness of code.

<!-- This concept becomes the root of the varied approaches and forms of support outlined in Chapter 5 and in the resulting uses of GDPs in Chapter  -->

<!-- MISSING SOMETHING ON DIALECTICS AND GERM CELL? -->

<!-- Some instances based on this kernel concept were created by myself in response to user requests in varied forms of support documentation outlined in Chapter 5 ( e.g. quick start card -->

 <!-- Design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework (compared to computational thinking) -->

<!-- While understanding the process is more obviously useful for faciliators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects. -->

<!-- Through this lens the most abstract activity system is the larger one who's objective, to make an engaging game that tells an environmental story, aligns with the problem level of LOA. The level between abstract and concrete is that of choosing, implementing and testing game design patterns, which aligns with design. The most concrete in this interpretation is then the implementation of different lines of code or creation and migration of digital assets. -->

### Comparing to pedagogies explicitly teaching abstraction, computational thinking and LOA

<!-- The term abstraction has varied interpretation even within the field of computer science education [@hazzan_reducing_2002]. -->
<!-- To ground this in GCSE examples.
Iteration and Selection are in the gcse example, tick examples of them. Just recognise. -->


<!-- The authors' exploration of the types of coders as either Planners or Bricoleurs can be used to begin analysis of aspects of the making styles explored briefly in Chapter 5. The author's perspective, aligns with my own which is that abstraction is clearly useful in computing projects but can be a barrier to participation. -->

<!-- and invites discussion on how best to teach this abstract approach to computation thinking. Grover [@grover_computational_2017; @grover_computational_2013] and Guzdial [@guzdial_learner-centered_2015] offer explicit techniques linked using the application of computer programming as the driving mechanism. Bell and colleagues [@bell2019constructing] explore the process of unplugged activities, exploring abstract CT concepts without using computers or coding. -->

<!-- The more concrete elements of CT definition [@brennan_new_2012], which exist on a more applied level, are readily observed in the data are explored in the appendix on learning map, -->
<!-- What has this research got to say about the relationship between the two? -->
<!-- **In terms of recommendations for researchers / practitioners of an intermediate framework:** -->
<!-- As such this research has only more theoretical propositions rather than participant data. -->

<!-- MOVED
The concepts and legacy of Papert and Turkle's [-@papert_epistemological_1990] exploration of diversity in coding approaches are introduced through what they call epistemological pluralism. The focus here is on their championing of approaches beyond the dominant formal, abstract approach that "emphasizes control through structure and planning" [@papert_epistemological_1990, p.134]. This approach can be characterised by the following: a top-down design process involving extensive planning prior to coding, explicit teaching of language principles and syntax, and coding from scratch rather than altering existing products. To counter this dominance, Papert and Turkle [-@papert_epistemological_1990] highlighted the value of a more concrete computing pedagogy, likening the process to bricolage, a craft-based approach where participants become very familiar with their tools and materials.  -->

<!-- Wing's CT framework is applicable some of the code creation processes I have undertaken as a learning designer, but is less relevant to participants. -->


#### Exploring data using concepts of Levels of Abstraction (LOA) & PRIMM

<!-- In their PRIMM pedagogy the researchers also incorporate the UMC model and draw parallels with LOA. In the Use stage of the UMC model [@lee_computational_2011] (explored in Chapter 5 in relation to this research's learning design), participants would be aware of the goal of the program, and the results. Subsequently, in the Modify stage they would become familiar with the design and code levels. -->

The use of the concept of levels of abstraction (LOA) and semantic profiles within the PRIMM pedagogy was explained as pedagogies in Chapter 2, the common value being in alternating between abstract and concrete levels of project structure and semantic concepts. The pedagogies are advanced to help teachers design learning experiences which allow for participant shifts in perspectives and thus deepen knowledge by packing and unpacking abstracted concepts via concrete experiences.  There are two relevant dimension of abstraction at play. The first has the abstraction and generalisation concepts present Wing's definition of computational thinking at one pole and concrete code implementation at the other. The second dimension present in the LOA framework is a hierarchy of elements: namely goal-design-code-results. The goal here being the most abstract element (see Table 7.x for more details).

<!-- It is relevant to distinguish the interpretations of different dimension abstraction described above: specifically Wing's and Papert's conceptions of abstraction, which can be described as present in top-down planning processes, and generalisable beyond context and abstraction present in the LOA framework is be characterised instead as a goal-design-code-results hierarchy, with the goal being the most abstract.   -->

Addressing interpretations of LOA [@waite_abstraction_2018] in video data we can map the levels of abstraction to shifts between conceptions of goals, implementation in code structures, and observations of results in my findings. While the teaching of the theories levels of abstraction is not explicit, movement is clearly happening, as demonstrated by the table below.


| **Level**            | **Focus** | **Example** |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Conceptual Level**  | Thinking about the GDPs to be added to the game | Goal formation, prioritisation |
| **Design Level**  | GDP supporting documentation scaffolds this process  | What it should do is to a large extent preset via documentation. |
| **Code Level**  | Writing the actual code, is supported via code patching  | is supported via code patching, and a structure which encourages modification. Debugging of code also happens at this level. |
| **Execution Level**  | Understanding the outputs | A strong correlation between goal and outcome, as playing the game product is very immediate. |

Table. 2.x Breakdown or Table of levels of abstraction. [@waite_abstraction_2018]

**Semantic Profiles**

The navigation between abstract and concrete poles in semantic profiles is different from that of LOA in that if we follow the guidance to place concepts of higher semantic density (for this read abstraction), in the  the upper scale, this would suggest Wing's interpretation of abstract CT concepts. However, given that in observations from video data, exploration of abstract CT concepts are rarely present, the resulting of semantic profiles show relatively shallow semantic waves. For the purposes of this analysis, it is appropriate to place the LOA  in the lower half of the profile (See Figure 7.x below)

As such, GDPs would be situated between abstract CT processes and concrete implementation. Thus, returning to the framing the design element of the use of GDPs as intermediate-level concept [@eriksson_using_2019], the interpretation of the data of this study using semantic profiles above supports this interpretation and opens up a new positioning within a pedagogical framework.


#### Description

This shallow semantic wave above is typical in describing the data of other participants in analysed session recordings. This profile aligns with the description of  Papert and Turkle's [@papert_epistemological_1990] maker styles a bricoleur. The data of Chapter 5 details the development of a learning pedagogy which aligns primarily to the more concrete applied approach as a way of ameliorating barriers of conceptual complexity. Observations show most participants operating as bricoleurs, feeling their way through their game-making via smaller-scale iterations rather than extensive periods of planning followed by implementation.

The following diagram is an approximate representation of this relatively shallow scope of movement using typical behaviour seen in Vignette 2.

With this focus, we can analyse my learning design where movement between layers of abstraction and concrete is happening. shifts do occur between participants goal formation and the concrete implementation using design practices and specific code structures. However, rather than a neat semantic sine wave as depicted in Fig 2.x in Chapter 2, for my participants,

MORE DETAIL ALIGNED TO FIGURE
Each time the participants imagine and choose a design pattern, implement it code patching, test it and then debug it shifts occur.

<!-- Even on a micro level when using the affordances within the template, variations in LOA are present. -->

Examples pervade the data of Vignettes, and descriptions of fluency in Chapter 6 in part stem from the fluid shifts in these levels. The level of detail in Vignette 2 for example is a good indication of rapid shifts.

Participant perspectives shift between the wider goal of making an engaging game for a real or imagined audience and a narrower goal of implementing a game design pattern and the technical actions and operations needed to complete it. GDPs help (or are relevant) in this process as they provide a tangible level of feedback in the most concrete level, and games provide high motivation to adjust code to get the result feeling just right (as seen in Chapter 6).

The packaging up together of code design and sample implementation in the gameplay design patterns provided facilitated rapid iterations of project changes and navigation between the poles of LOA via careful structuring of resources and documentation.


For other participants, see Vignette (Ed and Mark) shift are often more chaotically structured reflecting a _jumping around_ in the process.
In addition the observations in the discussion section of Chapter 6, which reject design stages, in favour of more chaotic improvisational approach.

Explicit exploration of CT code concepts and processes are present in data, but only when adults with relevant knowledge facilitator, either myself or parents, do point them out and during the process of code implementation. More implicit use of coding constructs is more common.
In summary, observations on of the typical semantic profile shows little or no activity show little activity on the level of code design.

This pattern is due the black-boxing of more complex and abstract element of the starting template and to structuring support around GDP implementation as explored in Chapter 5.

This is explored via rationale and the process.   REMOVE THIS LATER MAKE  BETTER LINK.


#### Processes of blackboxing


The typical semantic profile which shows little code design activity is due to design decisions to facilitate rapid feedback and code implementation through by abstracting (or black-boxing) more complex and abstract element of the starting template.

This is present in the close coupling present between the design and coding levels (present in LOA) in the scaffolding of GDP patterns via pre-designed code solutions with code snippets provided.


The judicial process of abstraction, referred to in design domain as black-boxing is present in several aspects of this technical approach (see Appendix.tech for fuller details). Examples include: use of code playground and existing template to simplify the use of the interacting web technologies; structural and syntactical template design decisions,    

The processes of abstraction or simplification for the user were outlined in Chapter 5 and can be summarised as.

- Code decomposition via the pre-existing functions in the code template
- Abstraction via the structuring of the template with key variables moved to the start of the code
- Abstraction again in template via the graphical design tool in the form of a grid matrix in an array data structure.
- Decomposition and generalisation (pattern recognition) were present in the structuring of the collection of GDPs  


These were initially intuitive decisions taken in response to participant need to facilitate concrete exploration. Subsequent analysis showed an alignment with constructionist design heuristics [@resnick_reflections_2005] .
IS THIS EXPLORED PREVIOUSLY IN CHAPTER 5?

Thus as a facilitator I undertook some code template design and implementation that would have been a potentially valuable learning experience requiring more generalisable computational thinking skills. However, these decisions were justified.  

#### Rationale for black boxing

Given the barriers present in abstract approaches explored in Chapter 2, the restriction in semantic density in terms of abstraction is chosen here in order to prioritise accessibility and flow experience. A bricolage approach in at that level would avoid abstract design structures which detract from a close relationship between the code and the desired results.

The process of scaffolding this abstraction allowed greater focus on more relational and affective elements of the learning design, processes which are described in more depth later.

Given the previously explored advocacy for alternating between abstract and concrete dimensions in semantic waves[@curzon_using_2020], and LOA research [@waite_abstraction_2018], is it of value to ask how the approach of concrete bricolage is odds with research on the value of semantic profiles.

The strongly coupled link (present in this design) between  description, and implementation, articulated as a problem-solution structure that is present in conventional conceptions of design patterns.

This coupling bears examination in relation to the positioning of GDPs as a leading activity, as illustrated by my decision to treat the implementation of each GDP as an activity system in itself. While the previous chapter explored the use of GDPs in various facets, this section turns to their utility for learners in this abstract/concrete domain.  


The close coupling between design and code structure levels in my design may not align with LOA principles given that "1:1 mapping between the design/algorithm and the code may lead to confusion between the levels" [@waite_abstraction_2018-1, p.21]. However, this is a teacher focused view and the benefits of participants being aware of what level they are working at are not fully explored in the research.
LINK TO NEXT SECTION.

Given that lack of explicit teaching, and the possibility that participants may confuse the the level they are working, it follows that Waite would cite this as problematic limitation in approach.

However, while explicit awareness of LOA, and the model of PRIMM imply explicit teaching of abstract concepts, the rationale and evidence to support the process is not clear. The difficultly in explicitly teaching abstraction rather than implicit approaches of appropriation [@kramer_abstraction_2003], while contested by  [@statter_teaching_2016], and based on work of Hazzan [-@hazzan_reflections_2008], underlying concerns are not fully addressed.  Waite's research does not include examples of activity explicitly teaching abstraction [@sentance_teachers_2019; @sentance_teaching_2019]. Therefore details of what counts as explicit teaching of abstraction is not clear.


Turning instead to the value for designers and facilitators, my reflections on research data support a proposition that there is utility for facilitators to be aware of the level of abstraction present in different elements of project learning design. This value encompasses both the concepts that learners are working with and those which are potentially accessible via explicit teaching.

While this research doesn't negate or preclude the value of explicit teaching of more abstract dimension of computational thinking, it suggests that GDPs are a more suitable accessible leading pedagogical framework than computational thinking.






<!-- #### otehr ponits
-  there is alternation between perspectives, and concepts but here it is not explicitly taught.
-  it could be taught.
-  I contend that overall, that facilitators can make use this mapping to make inform choices. -->





#### Alternative/s in approaches are possible

Thus, while the scope of movement here is relatively shallow, given a different focus or motivation, say that of a need to explore concepts due to curricular or exam pressures, an alternative pathway involving the exploration of abstract elements of computational thinking would have been possible. A possible alternative profile is represented in the illustration below.  


![Illustration 7.x - Possible alternative semantic profile  ](./Pictures/ch_7_sw_dia_2.png){width=95%}

In different contexts, the process of supporting students to follow the dotted path into areas of more abstract concepts could have been scaffolded further through guided reflective processes. As explored in Chapter 5, I explored modifications to the documentation to include candidate of the map of learning map dimensions in the initial descriptions of GDPS ( see Appendix.learningDimensions.)

A process to encourage this would be a gamification of the process of reflection, perhaps by attributing badges or points to the a successful reflection of different elements of learning dimension. The extrinsic nature of the process of gamification matches here the extrinsic contextual factors of examination-driven education. While this is a potentially fruitful area for future work, given the core context of non-formal learning of this study it was de-prioritised in this thesis.

At this stage, it is valuable to look past a potentially arbitrary placing of these levels within a hierarchy to investigate instead the core value of the relational nature of the framework to other concepts in the context of my research. To help with this analysis of utility,  -->

<!-- #### In SUMMARY

Thus in summary conceptions of abstraction above explored above include:

- Wing's take on computational thinking: abstraction, decomposition, generalisation / pattern recognition, implementation via an algorithmic process.
- A more holistic practice-based definition from Resnick, Brennan -
- Waite's LOA - abstract here drawing on levels within the problem or product  - navigation between levels, explicit teaching of such navigation. -->

<!-- Thus

<!-- Addressing the first aspect, the process of rising the concrete outlined above is helpful not just for analysis (a) but also for ongoing pedagogical design (b).

- the link with the experienced feature of the game / product as a framework increases inclusive nature of process (later?)

PERHAPS MOVE THIS TO NEXT SECTION
What about semantic waves and movement. How explicit does the understanding of the motion between poles need to be? For example in my design, it is not very explicit of guided towards. However, this may be different in different UK computing settings.

This potential non-alignment with UK non-formal may be a limitation in the take up of this research.   -->

<!-- #### Addressing utility for participants -->
<!-- One of the more developed work in GDP as such a framework is in Eriksson et al. The context of their GDP study is distinct in that whereas the young people in the Stringforce study are making design suggestions to alter a game they are not making their own games by modifying computer code. -->
<!-- In my design by contrast there is strong coupling between the role, description and implementation as illustrated by the structure of the supporting resources outlined in Chapter 5. -->

<!-- Reflections in progression of design in P4 showed my reluctance to lead with or explicitly teach abstract concepts with CT. Further discussion on the dilemma of how explicit teaching of computational concepts should be in taken up in the following section addressing the perspective for designers / teachers. -->
<!-- #### Turning to the utility for designers, reearcher and facilitators,  -->






<!-- If a knowledge of CT is needed by the learning context then it could be profitably explored in other ways. For example, developing resources suitable for such reflection,  for instance a learning map to be used by participants and teachers as explred in P4 . Linking from docs to descriptions of the characteristics. Thus not a leading pedagogical framework but a map of possible skills and concepts made possible by the leading activity. -->


<!--
My own notes and reflections (see appendix.learning in particular) map cautioned me against explicit teaching of abstraction and imposing shifts in perspectives for fear of interrupting the flow of participant making. In this context I judged the imposition of an additional goal of understanding abstract curricular concepts as potentially counter productive to the overall aim of acculturation to game making tools and processes and developing an inclusive idioculture.

IS THIS DOUBLED / DUPLICATED?
However this research contends that GDPs are a more suitable accessible  framework than that of computational thinking when making games and as such should be the leading  and guiding pedagogical framework. If a knowledge of CT is needed by the learning context then it could be profitably explored in other ways. For example, developing resources suitable for such reflection,  for instance a learning map to be used by participants and teachers as explred in P4 . Linking from docs to descriptions of the characteristics. Thus not a leading pedagogical framework but a map of possible skills and concepts made possible by the leading activity. -->


<!-- Route-based activities with a 1:1 mapping between the design/algorithm and the code may lead to confusion between the levels. -->
<!-- I had a reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge. My concern also reflected potential disorientation and reduced experiences of agency from imposed shifts of focus rather than self-initiated ones. I also propose that to further research to would be needed to justify the utility take the time to interrupt flow to explicitly teach abstraction, and abstract CT concepts, apart from if understanding of such concepts are required by curriculum constraints. -->


<!-- BUT WHAT ABOUT LEARNERS? HERE THE PERSPECTIVE IS BLURRED IF TEACHERS ARE STEERING TOWARDS A CURRICULUM. -->

<!-- As synthesis, in terms of semantic waves, the movement between abstract and concrete is helpful to address some of the issues concerning inclusion and accessibility of overly abstract approaches [@papert_epistemological_1990].
 -->


#### Reflections on design in relation to other research - PERHAPS VIA PRIMM AND UMC? AND HOW DO DESIGN PATTERNS FIT INTO THIS PICTURE - SGD & DENNER (AS FORM OF ANALYSIS)


While, the table of uses of GDPs in Chapter 6 focuses primarily on value for learners there are aspects which are relevant to facilitators or teachers in either non-formal or formal settings.

Turning to the utility for designers and and facilitators, it follows that the concerns above are also relevant for this group of stakeholders in terms of supporting learners. GDPs can also be useful for wider pedagogical and analytical motivations. One such motivation is the ability for a solid understanding of GDPs to open up exploration of other concepts.

Such a possibility returns to a tension in research on project-based approaches to digital making, in finding appropriate level of scaffolding [@waite_teaching_2021; @quintana_scaffolding_2004]. The use of conceptual and practical frameworks to scaffold domain specific working practices can help ameliorate the dialectical tension between engagement via tinkering and requirements to promote "principled understanding" [@barron_doing_1998, p.63].

Turning more specifically to the utility of the identification of structural use of GDPs as a germ cell concept, this break through facilitated the development of different progressively graded objectives (recognition, use and modification), as a concrete instance of UMC principles, which helps address the tension between freedom of choice of learner pathway, and expression of interest within a manageable technical structure (with relevant supporting documentation).

The structure synthesises element of scalable game design (SGD) and Use Modify Create (UMC) pedagogies.

Similar to SGD a progressively stepped approach is taken here.
These varied forms of documentation, and their varied adoption and propagation represent different approaches to  scaffolding the process of becoming familiar with and then modifying to the code in often increasingly ambitious ways.

While SGD was limited in participant pathway choice, my design is not. Following the rationale of choice limitation as a strategy to reduce facilitator stress [@lytle_use_2019], this design  using a limited menu of GDPs as a structural and navigational framework.


#### Summary of structural components of applied pedagogy   - REEPP & A gateway view of learning dimensions. MOVE DISCUSSION UP


This technical structure synthesises use of a code playground, game library, a half-baked game template, UMC pedagogy, and the use of a collection of game design patterns. While similar approaches exist this pedagogical structure is innovative in the way systemic tensions have been resolved and congruencies introduced. I propose that key elements of this pedagogy constitute a replicable approach which is a valuable contribution to coding education. To communicate the essence of this structural, technical model I propose an acronym remix enabled, elective, progressive, pattern patching (REEPPP).


| REEPPP Letter            | REEPPP Term  | Description |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **RE**  | **R**emix **E**nabled | Project formation is accelerated, limited and scaffolded through the use of a structural starting template in a recognisable project genre. |
| **E**  | **E**lective | Participants have choices over their learning pathways in dimensions of content and design patterns to be added. |
| **P**  | **P**rogressive | The processes involves progressive steps. In this case pattern recognition through exploration/play, quick start activities involving minimal changes with high impact on the project outcomes, using progressively more challenging documented patterns, finally implementing patterns without support |
| **P**  | **P**attern | The process has at its core the use of recognisable design patterns which are presented together with suggested design solutions and concrete code snippets. |
| **P**  | **P**atching | The authentic technical process of code patching accelerates production and creates errors suitable for debugging at a novice level. |

The above summary has been written to be applicable to projects beyond the use of games.


<!-- NOTE - THERE'S ANOTHER SECTION IN CH.8. -->

<!-- NOTE (If applies collaboratively, it becomes CREEPP) -->
<!--
NOTE DROPPED -
this break through facilitated the development of different "stepped" progressively graded project briefs which build one upon the other as a flexible scaffold (HOW?) -->



### Reexaming the use of GDPs from intermediate-level knowledge (to a gateway framework)

MOVE LATER? AND DEVELOP WITH REFERENCE TO SOCIAL AIMS TOO?
NO - KEEP HERE AND FOCUS ON PERSONAL AIMS FIRST.


![Illustration 7.x - GDPs as a gateway framework  ](./Pictures/ch_7_gateway_dia_4.png){width=50%}

<!-- Given this shift to include the utility for participants and the problematisation of the term intermediate, I propose a change in terminology. Instead of an _intermediate framework_,  -->




MOVE SOME OF THIS UP TO THE REEEPP SECTION - KEEP FOCUSED ON ABSTRACT / CONCRETE.

Within this line of inquiry concerning navigation of different levels of abstraction within this process, the characteristics of such a gateway framework would usefully include the following elements.

The process guides learners to use GDPs as their primary leading activity or object of activity (using CHAT terminology).

Secondly, a working code framework or template is provided with affordances strongly coupled with object output, providing immediate feedback.

Thirdly, just-in-time supporting resources are provided, closely aligned to the sub-goals of GDPs. Finally, this gateway framework may also facilitate reflection on its use, and reinforcement of this process can be structured using supporting tools, such as a learning map (see appendix.learningmap for an example in P4).

<!-- The use of a menu / collection of resources can be considered an inclusive educational practice and offer a rich description of a concrete example which aims to align to inclusive, practice-based frameworks like UDL and PBL. While this may involve more work in advance, the benefits to inclusive practice merit it. -->



### Link to next section - limits of this personal dimension approach



My research data shows the value of the REEPPP approach, structured around the use of GDPs, to access and facilitate dimensions of game making associated with both concrete and abstract knowledge and practices.

Broad descripton - SUMMARY OF UTILITY - DOES THIS LIVE HERE?
For participants, the GDPs facilitates goal formation. Once engaged with this goal, participants can use the affordances of the design to traverse different LOA without explicit instruction in the process of playtesting.

This analysis of the use of GDPs through the lens of research on the abstract and concrete dimensions in computing education, there is an alignment with the personal dimension of knowledge highlighted in the previous chapter.
This line of research also opens up other dimensions

The scaffolding provided by the template and the close coupling of the purpose, description and implementation of each GDP accelerates and supports the making process which in turn allows for greater possibilities of social and cultural making via playtesting outlined in the following section.

Thus the structural elements of this design facilitate the kind of relational pedagogies originally advocated by Papert and but which have too often been missing from research in this field.

The following section develops an analysis of the findings from the last chapter, outlining the potential of GDP concepts, especially within playtesting, to support these participant shifts in perspective. The following section addresses the social and cultural aspects of this study, using the development of varied forms of participant agency as an analytical lens.

<!-- PERHAPS BRING UP UP TO DATE ISSUE OF TRANSFER. - BUT PERHAPS LEAVE FOR CONCLUSION. NOTE ALSO THE BALANCE BETWEEN CT CONCRETE SKILLS AND TRANSFER IN [@kynigos_modifying_2020] -->

<!-- However this does not detract from the value of learners navigating different LOA in following their interests.
Leading with GDPs as a framework appears to support this  navigation, and at times in this research it is undertaken fluently and joyfully. -->

<!-- While I address areas for future research in the conclusion, a proposed benefit of this research is While understanding the process is more obviously useful for facilitators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects. To underscore the potential and to uncover a starting point for pedagogies that can be transferred to diverse design projects. -->

<!-- How then does this impact on conceptions of valuable pedagogies to help the development of coding fluency (NOTE THIS IS NOW MISSING FROM THE RQs) -->

**Revisiting - Motivation and gaps in research:**

The motivation of this study transcends concepts of efficacy of how to support the technical aspects of coding process.

At this point we can readdress one of the gaps addressed by the problem statement of the thesis: The lack of studies using socio-cultural perspectives to facilitate an agency based approach.

As noted in Chapter 2 [@kafai_constructionist_2015]. Despite Papert's [@lodi_computational_2021] foundational focus on the community application of created projects continues in legacy of constructionism. For example, the articulation of Resnick on computational fluency, addresses the limitations of research focusing too narrowly on technical approaches and toolsets rather than their expressive potential (and thus within a community)  and focused on toolsets rather than pedagogies [@resnick_seeds_2020; @resnick_coding_2020].

In a UK computing education context, while the work of Waite and Sentence begins to address sociocultural aspects of teaching programming [@sentance_teaching_2019; @hwang_using_2023], but as explored in Chatper 2 this work is limited in scope and invites further exploration.


**Why agency in particular revisit / gaps**

Given that a guiding motivation of this study to explore the process of designing and facilitating for participant empowerment in learning to program, it is valuable to explore terms.

Chapter 2 examined varied concepts and characteristics of fluency in constructionist research, and concepts of flow. Chapter 6 explored these concepts in relation to the data of this study and found agency to be better aligned to a socio-cultural approach.

**Setting out pathway - & thread for reader**

Firstly, an exploration of evolving expressions of agency emerging from the research data, specifically instrumental, transformational and relational agency, is undertaken.  

The second section is an exploration of the key characteristics of  participants agency using concepts from the work of Rogoff, Cole and Gutiérrez to re-examine the evolution of participant agency as a utopian process of blending or even patching of repertoires of different types and sources.

CHANGE THIS
It concludes by proposing that understandings of CGD&P pedagogies can be enriched in two dimensions, firstly in design and secondly in a deeper theoretical understanding of concepts of agency development.  

<!-- emerging from the Fifth Dimension (5D) strand of research, which while not specifically concerning computer programming, is aligned with the socio-cultural ethos of this thesis.
  -->
<!-- This section analyses the findings of the previous chapters using varied conceptions of agency aligned to the sociocultural theoretical framework of this study. -->

<!-- Chapter 5  exposed the tensions that developed in the activity systems and subsequent evolution the tools used include code authoring environment, supporting resources of printed and digital format. -->

<!-- ### Justifying the use of Metaphors in these FINDINGS - CONCLUSION?

A mixed readership for this research is hoped for as relevant to pracitioners and some of the break down of agency is quite academic in tone and potentialy opaque.

<!-- REMOVE THIS DUPLICATE EXAMPLE .
For example in my design:
Introducing additional tools in the form of documentation to the initial coding environment and template provided in early stages introduced tensions between the opportunities for independent development and the additional complexity of the process. -->


### Instrumental and transformational agency

The exploration of tensions in Chapter 5 summary, design decisions of tool use can to increase agency in practical terms by providing affordances or by removing barriers to use. Conceptually these practical dimension can be framed as instrumental agency or removing aspects of negative liberty caused by technical barriers [@matusov_mapping_2016, p. 433].  Chapter 6 outlined examples of mediation and instrumental agency in the use of GDPs aligned often with a personal appropriation (are shown in varied forms in Table 6.1). The process of abstraction of complexity explored above would also fall into this category. Examples of designed attempts to facilitate instrumental agency would be steps taken the resolution of tensions surrounding authenticity of coding web development language, coding environment and documentation.

A distinction can be made with and a transformative agency   [@isaac_cultural_2022], in that expression of instrumental agency are unlikely to provoke environment changes in the activity system at hand. Thus instrumental agency in education can be viewed as an uncomplicated view of mediation as a means to achieve pre-set goals. Thus designing for instrumental agency is often framed within an instruction or school setting.

In line with collective conceptions of agency explore in in Chapter to, transformational agency may stem from transcending individual motivation  but also involves a transformation to systemic constraints. As outlined in chapter 3, Sannino explains TADS using a metaphor of a using a kedging anchors [@hopwood_agency_2022]. In this metaphor the act of casting out the anchor is a visible act of volition which aims overcome conflicts blocking activity progress.

While affordances for mediation in conceptions of instrumental agency may be visible within the learning community, this metaphor encompasses a sense of the exploratory nature of the transformation, and that the leverage or catching point for change may not be immediately visible to activity participants in the activity system. The process may serve to surface previously unknown forms of mediation and use of tools not only for those undertaking this volitional activity but also others in the learning community.

Understandably, examples of this process in the research process were prevalent in early stages where participants had access to little in terms of supporting resources. Illustrative attempts of TADS are present in (Appendix.design.p1). For example, email correspondence from myself to participants asking for help in organising project work resulting in the emergence of list of proto-typical GDPs. Additionally the process of leading with exploration of a half-baked template was an experimental response from feedback from participants requesting more hand-on work with the tools before beginning planning. Thus emergence, via interaction between participants and myself, of and the use of a half baked template and GDPs as a suggested leading activity and pedagogical framework is a manifestation of transformational agency.

**Engendering transformative agency**

As a designer I began to noticed acts of volition to adapt the game making process, for example in adapting the game to add sound and characters of interest. In preparation for P2, to aid learners evolving activity, and then tried to add explicit affordances and make them visible to learners.

The process is on-going and mutual. Additionally, this work happens in an facilitated environment. Design decisions server to clarify common problems areas, thus making the water clearer to better see anchor points.
Integrate research on engendering authorial and transformative agency [@engestrom2006development; @haapasaari_emergence_2016; @sannino_formative_2016].

### Relational agency

The process of developing new repertoires is not a solo process. The complex relations between participants outlined in the vignettes and data of the last chapter, in particular that in guided participation and cultural activity, demonstrate  interdependence characteristic of relational agency.

Edwards  [@edwards2009systemic] explores relational agency within a CHAT framework as transcending individuals capacity to encompass collective problems solving via specialisation and diversity of approaches within activity systems. As a collective participants can overcome systemic contradictions via expansive learning, rearranging working relationships and thus opening new forms of relational agency. This concept is illustrated by the importance of feedback in community making and tinkering activities leading to increased "relational expertise" in partipants [@digiacomo_relational_2016-1 , p.144],

### Shifting forms of agency

This interpretation highlights possible shifts in forms of agency and an emerging dilemma in the evolving learning design. Initial blocks are solved by transformative agency, patterns and tools become established in the community, and agency shifts to and more instrumental.

| **Name** | Transformative Agency | Instrumental Agency | Relational Agency |
|----|-------------|----------------|---------------|
|**Characteristics:**|  When participants are blocked from progressing or what to move their work in an new direction | Instrumental agency is present in the straight-forward mediational use of existing written instructions and in-template affordances. | Relational agency is present in the interactions between participants asking for help, sharing developing expertise, and via incorporation of home interests in new repertoires of practice  |
| **When shown:** |  In P1 before written instructions were available. Also in P3 when diverting from the existing template paradigm (V?). | Present from P2 onwards.  | Relational agency is present in P2 where forms of it emerge organically during playtesting and in P3 where it is also structured by introduced activities  |
| **Examples:** | In P1 participants suggest the use of lists of features as a key organising tool, a process culminating in a collection of GDPs.  In P3 Toby and Dan make a maze game instead of a platformer game (V?). | Examples: in use of quick start activities, and in V2 Toby use of written instructions | In the following vignettes  |

### Overview / recap of relational agency and repertoires in theory - KEEP SHORT


This section moves beyond instrumental and transformative agency to a wider more ecological interpretation of agency helpful in deeper analysis of the cultural plane of activity. In chapter 6 we examined the complexity of the expanded object in this research, noting the diversity in terms of motivations and mediational strategies using 3GAT terminology [@engestrom_development_1996]. The following section builds on the foundation of 3GAT in terms of conceptions of interacting activity systems [@engestrom_development_1996] using concepts of repertoires of practice and third spaces. Rogoff and Gutiérrez [@gutierrez_cultural_2003; @gutierrez_youth_2019-1] use repertoires as a lens to contribute to discussion of expansive learning in CHAT as a positive enacted demonstration of diversity and equity. Third spaces for Gutiérrez are collective zones of proximal development, which can be both an specific environment and/ or a process within existing contexts supporting a hybrid approach where formal and informal repertoires are blended in collaborative work on an expanded object with an aim to ADD IN?.

The following section reframes my research data using  concepts of repertoires and third space  via attention to issues of participant identity and movement of practices between learning settings.  While the data in the last chapter focused on the diverse mediational use of GDPs, this chapter widens the focus of data examined to include relevant element of practices.

The overall goal is to communicate a diversity of participant repertoires [@gutierrez_rethinking_1999], via mediational tactics and resources in learning contexts in order to answer the research questions RQ.P AND RQ3: most specifically clearly in identifying and nurturing dimensions of agency formation in this research to contribute to the field of CGD&P.  

<!-- COME BACK TO THIS - WHAT IS THE GOAL IN DEPTH. -->

<!-- This section contends that relational agency is the closest fit to match the development of these three elements but will complexify this via comparative analysis with transformational agency in the final section. -->

<!-- This section explores the findings of previous chapters using three of these concepts of that or third spaces, idiocultures and repertoires of practice.

#### Playtesting as a suitable medium for emerging activities creating third spaces

Previous observations highlighted an emerging idioculture.

Gutiérrez develops this idea with a space for such emerging cultural activities. Third space theory.

Playtesting as an incubator for emerging cultural activities, has been crucial to the development of later stages of this learning design. The sum of introdued and emerging elements of repertoires can be framed as constituting the development of a particular game making idioculture.

As explored in the literature review, playtesting is a process common to game making which corresponds to the evaluation phase of design thinking cycles and the process of user testing in HCI [@fullerton_game_2018].


An analysis on the role of playtesting and an emerging forms of playful playtesting follows.

The following sections are an exploratory mapping of some possible design features which may represent component repertoire elements or facilitate the process of identity development within the design in other ways.

<!-- In this section, I recall data to describe some of the emerging playtesting behaviours of participants in relation to the introduced learning design. -->

### Repertoire movement between spaces, repertoires in practice (FOk) practices, Dol and helping styles   

Following Gutiérrez's [-@gutierrez_developing_2008; -@gutierrez_learning_2019-1] concept of learning as movement between spaces, key observation from the data of the previous chapter can be reframed as repertoires that existed on other activity systems and its impact on learning activity in .

**Funds of Knowledge**

This movement is well illustrated in the mobilisation of game related funds of knowledge in playtesting and in design stages, in particular ideation.

See table 6.x for examples.

In particular the following are useful to illustrate the use of existing competenties and interests.

the identification with graphical art  in Madiha's family, and Ed's interest in trains
and more professional knowledge brought by Dan.

One of they key findings of the previous chapter is the diverse use of GDP concepts within processes which allowed participant to incorporate practices and interests from home life or other spaces.

**Helping styles and other forms of division of labour**

Barron's helping roles [@barron_parents_2009], Roque [@roque_family_2016; @roque_im_2016] employed supporting facilitators to highlight and celebrate the helping processes parents used to support children in a making environment.

All of these these roles are illustrated in varied forms in the data.
WHERE IS THIS SHOWN? HOW RELEVANT? JUSTIFY LEVEL IT IS EXPLORED.

In addition, other divisions of labour which highlight the emerging roles of young people are present the data.

Examples include:
home pedagogies like paper based sketching
Knowledge to support literacy and attention management from S & T

MOVE OR DROP
This blending of the use of GDP concepts, in-template affordence, supporting resources, with such knowledge and practices from other activity systems can be analysed using the concept of repertoires.

### Emerging identity formation via specialisation

The emergence of new forms of identity within the idioculture is particularly significant to this research given the barriers participation in programming communities explored in Chapter 2.


It is of note to make a distinction between the leverage of existing competencies and interests as repertoires (explored above ) and the emergence of new ones.

The process of new identity formation via repertoire blending is explored here via the concept of specialism.


The process of feedback, recognising and valuing the merging areas of specialisation and expertise helps the development of diverse practices [@digiacomo_relational_2016-1]. The specialisation contributes to possibilities of relational agency for the learning environment as a whole. It exists as a form of identity within an individuals repertoire and for others to draw on as an affordance of the learning system.

These repertoires become public, and are in part socially motivated, via the process of playtesting.

The awareness of and conversations about maker styles and related side-missions created in this research are potential powerful tool to support this process in novice game making communities.


#### Specialism (in making / not playtesting this can be brief? )

Within more narrowly defined game making activities centred around altering code and assets of their products, learners who had mastered certain specialist skills were asked by others for help. Their developing roles as domain experts provided additional affordances in the learning community and building an identify as specialist within it.

ARE EXAMPLES NEEDED HERE?

In terms of styles,

Playtesting played a role in the surfacing and opportunities for this specialism to propagate.

#### Expressions of identity in variations in approaches to playtesting

I observed bother initial styles and evolutions of the form and function of playtesting by  participants.

Some participants refrained from extensive testing of other games, waiting for others to test their games and observing their responses. Others were very social in their playtesting approach. Madiha making very positive comments on design of player characters and building relations in that way. The last chapter showed that some participants used playtesting as a way to gain idea of what to add to their game next and to ask for direct help in that process.  

Some children added additional playful elements to playtesting (see Appendix.playtestingtypes).  Playtesting surfaced design practices which involved a playing against game design norms of the genre.

Some in particular brought a physicality to the process, clustering in a particular zone of the class, referencing the game play elements, acting them out, attempting to change the games of others and playful tussling as part of resistance to those changes.


<!-- NOTE COMMENT  - This evolution maker types here exists especially in social makers, glitchers and gpies. -->


### Interventions to accelerate and facilitate the process of repertoire blending

The work of  Stone and colleagues [@stone_problem_2007-2] underline the importance of "opportunities to transform learner identities needed for zones of competency" as something that can and should be designed into inclusive learning environments (focusing on goal development).


The diversity in playtesting behaviours drove my reflection on the relationship between developing effective repertoires and an affective relationship to the activity relies on the participants being able to identify with the ongoing activity (thus informing a processes of inclusion)

As, the area of explicit cultural creation of spaces is under explored in existing research in CGD&P, it is of value to explore the process of explicit learning design for identity development within via repertoire blending.

<!-- NOTE AND the additional motivations flowing into this system from other activity systems.
HOW AND WHY? MOTIVATIONS IN PARTICULAR? -->

Playtesting acted as a stimulus and incubator for emerging socio-cultural practices prompting me to ask if suitable affordances be added to the design to encourage their further growth in line with Gutiérrez's valuing of the inclusive, diverse properties of hybridity in practices [@gutierrez_rethinking_1999].
Addressing issues of motivation and positive affect, the role of play as leading activity is explored by Gutierrez [@gutierrez_learning_2019-1] to facilitate movement between sites of learning.

Thus in the following section playtesting is explored  not only as a productive, evaluative design stage, but as a space to host other playful activities.


#### The introduction of maker types and side missions as affordances of my pedagogy to legitimise diversity


**Side missions**

Side missions explored in Chapter.5 and Appendix. x?

The process contextualises and legitimises the previously peripheral activities with the groups conceptions of the idioculture of the wider activity. This recognition of the hybridity of possible modes of participation increases conceptions of enacted diversity of the community.

This strand of thought also invites an theoretical examination of the value of identify formation via the blending of repertoires of play and design approaches.

The invitation to play, can be seen as a familiar  affordance leading to more unfamiliar territory. A helping process in blending through opening a door to a new collaborative zone of proximal development.

**Maker types**

Rogoff and Gutierrez's initial motivation in their exploration of repertoires was to challenge simplistic, overgeneralising approaches regarding learning styles especially if applied to non-dominant communities [@gutierrez_cultural_2003]. The researchers highlight the value of identifying potential funds of knowledge framed as "linguistic and cultural-historical repertoires" that learners bring to learning environments [@gutierrez_cultural_2003, p.22].

Inspired by the work of Barron and Roque
[@roque_family_2016; @roque_im_2016] to begin to surface and nurture making and helping styles. The use of these roles by facilitators reinforce a existing competence in a new space.

I extended this beyond parent roles and identity to include all participants, via design as well as feedback,  with a similar aim to engender a feeling of domain competency.

Rather than refocusing participants back to more coding-focused activities, I coded playtesting and game making approaches in to a loose typology (see Appendix .makertypes for fuller detail).   

<!-- -   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game   
- **Planners:** like to study to build knowledge of the tools before they build up their game step-by-step following instructions
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users. -->

While not a conscious link, there is a parallel to the contrast between planners and bricoleurs present in this typology. By way of contrast the wider focus playtesting as well as coding behaviours.

Some approached objectives in a methodical manner, others socially and others embracing a playfully disruptive stance. Some decided to focus extensively on the creation and implementation of graphical assets and level design.

## Implications for design & a contribution proposal


### Designing for shifting forms of  agency

In the introduction I outlined that a driving motivation of this research was to better understand chaotic learning environments, of which P1 is an example. Given this draw to conditions of TA, such shifting forms of agency could create a resulting tension.

As a learning designer, design decisions to reduce practical tensions, increase the instrumental agency of learners allowing them to experience a feeling of control over their creative process. However, in adapting designs, and thus increasing affordances and instrumental agency here is a danger of designing away the possibility for transformational agency.

To retain this potential for transformation it may be advantageous to keep some key areas of the learning design should be more open in structure to encourage the emergence of participant responses and novel practices. Evidence of this exists, beyond P1, there were still spaces for TA once the core pedagogy is in place. For example, in Vig. Tody and Dan the break out of the template to create a different genre.

Also, not everyone like messy / sketchy pedagogies, there is a danger that  levels of stress for participants may reduce the inclusivity.


<!-- DO I? IS THIS NOT PART OF CHAPTER 6? -->

<!-- #### on alien chatmes shared and celebrated by the group.

Thus transformation is happening here but not in a revolutionary way. It is more of a blend of practices. In my data this happens in vignette data we can see elements of personal interest of young people, of home education collaborative work patterns, and of practices introduced by the facilitator from professional and educational contexts.  
Perhaps add back in as an unintended consequence?
The live chat process started unintentionally as one child was left to their own devices as a parent was undertaking a social mission (see below and previous chapter). -->



### Metaphors as a way to communication dimensions of agency design concerns

The previous sections have explored a complex and multi-faceted view of participant agency in this learning design. Before undertaking a fuller summary in the final section of this chapter, this section reinterprets some of these aspects using a metaphorical approach. The use of metaphor here has two functions. The first is to help deepen my analysis via a move to the abstract, searching for communicable generalisations. Secondly, given the multi-faceted nature of the pedagogy, and bearing in mind previous reflections on the value of an utopian approach to communicating the future possibilities of findings [@rajala_utopian_2023; @gutierrez2020utopian] paired with the conceptual difficulties of communicating complex pedagogical affordances of adaptable media-making toolsets (e.g., Logo and Microworlds [@kynigos_half-baked_2007; @kynigos_black-and-white_2004-1]), I draw on metaphors as a framing tool to present an initially simplified viewpoint for further discussion. The discussion will draw from these metaphors' relatable core principles to aid the accessibility of this research for an audience of practitioners as well as researchers.


<!-- In this case metaphors concerning learning spaces and movement between spaces are often found in existing research including: walled gardens, playgrounds, sandboxes, harbours. -->

<!-- **Complexity of the findings and emerging pedagogy** -->

<!-- Beyond practical aspects of dissemination, a further challenge associated with the overall goal of bringing a complex, flexible, learner-driven pedagogy to bear, is addressed by Kynigos , in articulating the limitation of uptake of ideas surrounding Microworlds. -->

<!-- There are a lot of moving parts in the final pedagogy and while I have put in work to address foundational aspects using relatable metaphors, the target audience in terms of coding enviroment designers, represents challenges in terms of complexity.   -->

<!-- I do brand it , and provide useful contributions in concrete instances of work -->


#### Harbours as both protective and authentic

The intrigue of opening up previously mysterious areas and seeing or experimenting with what makes them tick, often referred to as looking under the hood, applies here in the early stages of the learning experience. The process of clicking remix to fix a broken, half-baked game involves entering unfamiliar and potentially exciting waters. However, the motivational impact of an authentic process and set of tools must be balanced by possible accompanying complexity [@nachtigall_authenticity_2024].

Harbours are protective spaces suitable for docking ships. They may be natural or designed. If designed, protection is offered by artificially created harbour walls extending out into the sea, creating a sheltered space, preventing large waves from entering but also allowing movement out into the open sea. Harbours provide the possibility for refuelling or maintaining sea vessels and infrastructure to connect to rail or road links for transport inland. The term harbour is used metaphorically to indicate a space of safety, nurturing, and a gathering space f


<!-- SUMMARISE - MOVE EXTRA / EXAMPLES UP TO THE FIRST SECTION - FIND A GOOD PLACE FOR IT. -->


While this design uses an authentic, professional text-coding language with its inherent challenges, many other design decisions in this study were made to create a supported, simplified coding environment. Relevant examples from the previous chapter include: using an online code playground; shielding learners from the underlying configuration of interrelated web technologies; removing or obscuring structural code complexity in the code template.

<!--
My design decision to build the toolset as structure on top of authentic tools and languages can be likened to creating a protective harbour to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency. -->

The practice of starting from a template mirrors professional practice. The goal being to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency. This strong alignment with authentic, professional practice may help learners transition from a supported harbour to venture out into the open seas of less supported research and practice.

An example of this being Toby and Dan in Vignette X. who, in their choice to change the game genre from platformer to maze game, leave the safety of a set of design patterns and paired support documentation. Instead, Toby must develop his code patching skills in choppier waters by accessing more authentic documentation and charting their own patterns in the open sea of internet-based resources. This is made possible by having an experienced navigator with him, in the form of a parent with relevant skills. I propose that the curated replication of authentic processes of finding and incorporating code snippets into the starting template supported the development of skills used in the authentic waters of professional coding communities.


In terms of agency and choice over learner pathway, we can see that the safe nature of the harbour encourages free exploration within its area. There are limits to the rhizomatic nature of this exploration. The boundaries of the harbour walls represent the restrictive decisions in terms of the genre of end product, and simplifications in code structures used. The following section explores the restrictions (e.g. in genre) from a perspective of the creative potential of such limitations [@rosso_creativity_2014].



<!-- This alignment with a rhizomatic approach within a structure has been explored in this thesis using a metaphor of a harbour in terms of the conceptualisation of the design from a facilitator / designers point of view. The habour walls represent the restrictive decisions in terms of the genre of end product, and simplifications in code structures participants must understand or create to make progress. -->

<!-- to other forms of web coding projects, due to the similarity of as this element of practice.
CH.5 -->
<!-- While it is important to acknowledge the danger that such support may make learners run into trouble if coding other projects outside of this supported space, the use of authentic code language makes this less of an issues than with specialised coding environments aimed at novices [@hagge_coding_2018]. Thus to make one addition to the metaphor this design is like a sea-harbour, tools like Scratch are like a swimming pool. -->



#### Spaces to play - playgrounds and jam sessions

<!-- The freedoms and restrictions of playgrounds -->

A similar metaphorical dimension of protection is present in metaphors of play spaces, a link which is immediately present in this design in the use of code playgrounds (web-based environments which reduce the complexity of web development and provide immediate feedback and community). Additionally, the process of checking the performance of games is called play-testing, with connotations of a playful, and therefore social space. Similarly, the term sandbox is used extensively in web development to indicate a safety in terms of non-critical space to trial new code and make mistakes. As with harbours, a space of play space evokes protection within designed limitations [@rosso_creativity_2014], but beyond that they provide affordances to encourage learners to evolve their own play processes as a form of transformational and relational agency. The concept of musical play within jam sessions is a productive way to explore this tension between freedom and structure.


In the previous chapter, I explored the flexible nature of emerging design behaviours and proposed them as a form of improvisation or jamming. Jamming, a term common in music and theatre, describes responsive, improvised, rapid and fluid responses to collaborators' ideas and audience reactions [@pinheiro2011creative; @sawyer_group_2003]. The area of improvisation is underexplored in the game jam context compared to that of music and theatre [@jaffurs_impact_2004-1; @merilainen_game_2020]. The following section makes a closer parallel in the context of the data of this study.

On a macro-level, at a jam event, infrastructure in terms of drums, microphones and amps are provided often by established regulars of the process. A jam on a micro-level is an introduced, familiar framework, restricted in that it is based on a familiar, popular song (often referred to as standards), within agreed genres (most often blues and jazz). The short structure of a song and the key in which it is performed form a base guiding improvisation. Within a jam process, bringing your own style to build on that structure is welcomed. The process is augmented by the group element of the musical jam, where music makers pick up techniques from others in the process. Visual and verbal encouragement is often present in successful jam nights to encourage newcomers. If a jam session is regular, local popular standard songs emerge. This provides opportunities to hear them played regularly, allows potential participants to hear them versioned before entering, a useful form of peripheral participation.


Several parallels to the design and processes in my research exist. The half-baked game template can be seen as a shared song framework that participants build on in idiosyncratic ways. The value of a process that incorporates an authentic audience made up partly of peer makers is important for the development of repertoires of practice in both contexts. The value of the possibility to blend established repertoires with those brought by new players is a shared contextual motivation.

<!-- While the distributed nature of the toolset, hindered peer learning in P1 as too many tools were introduced, in P2 it helped build authentic digital literacy skills.  -->

 <!-- and the presence of affordances suggesting a particular form of action. For example a roundabout, or climbing frame in a playground invites a certain kind of interaction.

Thus in the design of this study

- template affordences,
- GDP menu as affordences

Other affordances of the design would encourage greater authorial (and relational agency), for example those designed to build user's sense of belonging in the game making community.

In this research, similar metaphors have emerged in the pedagogical and technical process surrounding the concept of playgrounds and gardens. In the previous section the use of a curated set of design patterns can be thought of as play areas or equipemtn inviting interaction.
 -->

<!-- **Games and play spaces**

These metaphors invite a connection to play theories concept of as the magic circle. Play theorist outline the value of stepping into a more controlled area of voluntary experimentation where the fear of failure is reduced. Game rules are norms which seed participation in community processes.

The concepts of affective space and magic circle  as a way to encourage participants to improvise from a starting structure are of value to provide guidance to practitioners in the domain of informal digital design.
or examples see the book , a
The playful context of the game's magic circle can facilitate participants to adapt norms and rules to their own playing styles. Through this lens, the interaction of playtesting, code playgrounds and a sandbox of game patterns emerge as a key practices to facilitate and maintain learner agency. The discussion of the next chapter explores the intersection of these elements in more detail. -->

- the emergence and nurturing of flexible and complex design behaviours (beyond player types) -->

### CCRREEPP &  GDPs as a gateway pedagogical framework

This chapter contend that the underlying structure of the learning design in addition to support the social and cultural processes described above, is a valid contribution to the field as a technical pedagogical structure.


There is a value of attempting to integrate the holistic approach outlined in this research by unifying the strands of part one and part two of this chapter. To do this the structural element of the REEPP framework would need to be augmented with the socio-cultural elements explored in part two. To do this, I propose the lengthy but logical acronym: collaborative, culturally responsive, remix enabled, elective, progressive pattern patching (CCRREEPPP).

<!-- In this cultural context the process of patching also references the process of repertoire blending outlined above. -->

### GDPs as a gateway pedagogical framework

I propose that providing a menu of GDPs can, as with accessing more abstract concepts, act as a  framework to facilitate to process of development of social and cultural repertoires of practice.

I suggest  a change in terminology. Instead of interpreting design patterns here as _intermediate_ constructs, I propose the term _gateway pedagogical framework_ to communicate potential utility in opening up exploration of different dimensions of learning.

![Illustration 7.x - GDPs as a gateway pedagogical framework   ](./Pictures/ch_7_gateway_dia_3.png){width=95%}


The shift from intermediate to gateway also addresses the issue of how to present the dimensions of abstract and concrete. Abstract concepts are often positioned as higher in a spacial representation. This is present in semantic profiling diagrams above, in y example, and even the phrase top-down planning from Papert and Turkle in their challenging of this privileging of abstract approaches communicates an implied superiority of approach. By way of contrast, the Mark's phrase _rising to the concrete_ reverses this polarity. Similarly, as a small attempt to challenge this convention I reverse the polarity placing concrete dimension at the top of the illustration.

### Second area of contribution to the research in the field:  A complex view of agency and repertoires development AND the value of that to contribute to research on DBR / FI etc.

<!-- - Addressing gaps in the research - The work of Resnick is convincing but lacks theoretical foundations as Papert's ideas were before their time. It is of value to align them with more contemporary socio-cultural conceptions, in particular the lens of agency.
- Also, as agency is seen beyond a individualised property, as participation in a community - as such computational fluency should also be challenged as a individualised approach.
- agency as choice over learner pathway potential is present in the potential of the menu of GDPs
- But beyond that simplistic element of choice, Development of relational agency is a part of the social and cultural aspects of repertoires development, which can be aided by the use of techniques like the explicit structuring of playtesting with side missions and implicit pedagogy of supporting maker types and parental helping roles.
- because of the DBR approach, agency here can be conceived  is ideally part of a utopian process, and thus as equity [Gutierrez], where there limitation in my approach, there are the essential conditions present. Thus it is transformational (which may not scale)
- More broadly this research can be developed beyond agency to encompass, equity, diversity, enacted, concrete, thus towards inclusion. -->


<!-- Given this challenge, the process of presenting the main elements of the learning design as a whole are challenging [@kynigos_half-baked_2007; @kynigos_black-and-white_2004-1], and bearing in mind that there are already a good degree of complexity in the pedagogy summarised above, it begs the question is it tactical to attempt such a synthesis in terms of the specifics of the learning design. -->





#### Types of agency? Specialism

It is of value to examine specialisation as a form of agency and new identity formation.

It can be seen through the lens of double stimulation. The choice to specialise, marks a form of transformative agency. Participants craft for themselves a specialist status which becomes shared and celebrated by the group.

Thus transformation is happening here but not in a revolutionary way. It is more of a blend of practices. In my data this happens in vignette data we can see elements of personal interest of young people, of home education collaborative work patterns, and of practices introduced by the facilitator from professional and educational contexts.  



#### Summary of discussion on designing for agency

IS THIS LINKED TO THE TABLE OF DESIGN TENSIONS AND RESOLUTIONS?

Agency in this in game making community is seen as multi-dimensional and as a process located in community participation rather than an individualised property.

A straight forward manifestation of agency stems from the importance of the collection of GDPS as a guiding activity. The  resulting choice over learner pathway helps transcend  limitations typical in instruction based approaches.

Beyond that element of choice, development of relational agency is a part of the social and cultural aspects of repertoires development, which can be aided by the use of techniques including:
- explicit structuring of playtesting with side missions
- implicit pedagogy of supporting maker types
- and parental helping roles.

PLACE FOR THE TABLE OF METAPHORS HERE?

My proposal is that this research supports a view that the above techniques align with x and thus an excellent candidate to address gaps in reseach in the field of CGD&P




## Conclusion


As this chapter is ongoing this conclusion is in draft form. Feedback on what to include in this chapter conclusion is welcome.

- the place of this chapter in the narrative of the thesis
- the limitations or questions arising that may be addressed in the following chapter.

**limitations/ further work**

This work invites exploration of related issues of
- inclusion as a lens

The final chapters aims to address this with  recommendations for facilitators and researchers. The scope of the applicability is addressed as the findings of this thesis can inform the wider debate of how to best support project based learning in wider domains. Specifically the use of concrete design frameworks and step-based iterative project in scaffolding PBL.


### Summary of  the potential utility of GDPs? of abstract / concrete exploration?  for several stakeholders

HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO ABSTRACT / CONCRETE THING OF PT 1.
AND TO THE SUMMARY TABLE OF CH. 6.

The work of Quintana et al contains useful guidelines for checking the suitability of a framework to support science education [@quintana_scaffolding_2004]. In particular guideline x, and y can be identified in the use of GDPS in this research.

The evidence and examples surfaced in Chapter 6 and the previous section support a view that the GDPs can form the basis of productive research and pedagogical frameworks.

While the work of Eriksson et al. explored the utility of GDP concepts in several dimensions the focus was on utility for the research community.

This chapter has outlined he observed and potential uses of GDPs for different stakeholders in this context: specifically, comparing their utility for researchers, participants and facilitators/ learning designers.


**For participants**
Addressing utility for participants, in computing education, design pattern-based approaches have benefits in making complex problems more modular and concrete [@muller_almost_2004-1; @waite_teaching_2021].

GDPs are particularly helpful in participant goal formation, as explored in Chapter 6 in the sections on ideation and prioritisation. GDPs also help with the division of labour between collaborators, which is relevant here as when tackling more abstract processes, concepts, and terminology, these roles are often taken on by a more competent partner.


**Value for researchers of the intermediate framing & b & c**

Quick summary of value

In the framing of CHAT, the implementation of GDPS can be treated as a distinct activity systems (see Fig in last chapter)




<!-- Chapter four outlined a design narrative where tools were chosen and adapted by myself and Participants in response to local context. Chapter five explored the emerging organisational unit of GDPs, and how they were used as meditational strategies.   -->

<!-- This chapter has explored emergent cultural and community activity, and deepened discussion on interpersonal activity, and then returned to discuss implications for dimensions of concrete tool use on learner agency. -->

<!-- The methodology chapter outlined some of the challenges of this approach, particularly in the thick description of context, and the challenge of then satisfying the goal of generalisability / and overall utitlity. -->

## TO MOVE OR DROP FROM CHAPTER



### On planned and emergent activity)

MOVE TO A DISCUSSION SECTION?
COMPRESS FOR INTRO?
THIS IS PART OF DBR - REFERENCE THAT IF IT IS STILL NEEDED FOR THE CHAPTER.



The previous chapters have described interventions in design that can be characterised on a spectrum between those planned and introduced by myself as a facilitator and those which were emergent, i.e. invented or adopted by participants as a response to the contradictions covered in chapter four.  

The distinction between planned and emergent activities became blurred as practices merged. In Chapter 6 outlines that while  I tool a lead to collate game design patterns into an organised collection with accompanying resources and a navigational menu, many of these patterns, were introduced  initially by participants who recognised them and wanted to add them to their own games.

This aligns with a key characteristic of formative intervention and DBR. Namely that elements of the introduced design changed responsive to learner need as the design evolved through iterations. Some introduced  processes outlined in this chapter were very minimal in embryonic form but extended significantly by participants.


AT theory emphasises that the process of activity does not start in a vacuum. This helps justify the formative intervention process which is active in intervention and in the initial shaping of activity. In an educational context, this can involve introduction of tasks as starting activities to shape. This is justified conceptually from a view of not restricting participant agency in that some form of activity should be suggested in order for them to make a rational choice as to weather to participate. It follows that this activity should encourage the communication that participant choice is significant in the design.


## Notes - MOVED TO THE END FOR REVIEW

<!-- While, the personal expression via narrative and asset design can be engage and sustain the motivation of participants, these processes brought tensions identified in the _design chapter_ namely: (edit down into list? ) -->

<!-- **Exploring Tension - time spent on task - ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**
Take the example above, through use of pixel art editor, and template with small, retro themed graphics, as a designer, reduce the propensity to spend along time on asset creation as retro pixel art is quicker to make. -->

<!-- **Expectations- ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**
- incorporating familiar or personally meaningful elements can involve challenges including that of unrealistic expectations based on previous game playing experiences -->






<!-- NOTE - NOTES ON THE CULTURE OF HARDNESSS - FIT IN SOMEWHERE IF APPROPRIATE

When explored from game making perspective the hard is good lens, is limiting in terms of building the engagement of players. However, culturally the desire to make games hard for other participants is more understandable in the context of retro games. .

- arcade games were designed to be hard to extract money from players
- nes games reputation for being brutal as they often had no way to save states, and much of the games challenge, due to limitations of number of levels or modes of playing, depended on this 'hardness'
- this developed later for snes games , finding challenge and other forms of ways of maintaining interest for different genres of games_
- retro games are associated therefore with being brutal and frustrating.
- thus in some ways the process of making a hard game is a way of getting your own back at all the games that have frustrated

### Building Identities as Game Makers  - EXTENDED

PARK THIS FOR NOW IN DESIGN CHAPER

COULD RETURN TO THIS IN A DISCUSSION CHAPTER - AS HAS IMPACT ON GDP TOO.

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with the positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you. -->

### Creating Community Activity   

- Theortical context
  - Collaration from AT perspective - "collaborative activity" see [@eriksson_using_2019] for an overview

- Peer - side by side coding.
  - Parents coding too. See the comments by Molly:and her interactions / commentary. And the interaction of Ch-Pa and Te - the quiest support there.

- Game Playing and playtesting
   - Game playing at start of program - no observations but sets context
   - Play testing - and challenge - a culture of "hardness", curiosity about number of levels, as a vehicle for peer support,

- Drama Process
 - differencing attitudes to games and technology
 - a reflective process to avoid distracting from activity & to share goals and process publically

PERHAPS MOVE TO CONCLUSION

Highlighting and supporting these more naturally emerging roles behaviours may be more useful  (explain - well aligned to creating a game making community?) to facilitators in informal environments that the more prescriptive roles in pedagogies like pair programming.
 -->

<!--
MOVE THIS SOMEHOW INTO A DISCUSSION AREA
#### Helpers supporting supportive community behaviours

While not a key part of this study, it is of value to briefly examine the role of student helpers in this phase.
One of their remits was to support the work of participants and to guide reflection by asking simple questions like "What have you been working on?", What are you working on now. What do you want to add to your game. Beyond this, students also gave feedback between playtestings sessions, connected different participants, supported parental behaviours,   into the design process via debriefing sessions. In journal notes I made observations and gathered feedback, while not fo extensively studied there is potential here.
Especialy in the potential to replicate family supportive behaviours with non-expert facilitators in a volunteering settings, specifically with bespoke guidance to support game making.

<!--
#### Code roles  and experimentation

While the parents are the ones doing the majority of the heavily lifting importing new code, children are observering and emulating this behaviour.

In one interaction child Ne visits the page to add a mechanic, starts to scan it, highlights some code, but then seems to change her mind
- perhaps recognising limits - or fearing the process of breaking her game - and returns to more familiar territory of changing game assets and level design.

**Productive in in**

- Glitch - 2019-05-08 - Te and Da  - create moving enemy but it totally leaves the screen. This caused amusement and participants knew how they thought they would follow that up.

 The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful. -->

 <!-- As mentioned in the previous sections, after analysis of this vignette in particular, it seemed promising to investigate behaviour and engagement at different stages of design process for this pair. To do this I have made extensive notes and used a coding structure for two complete sessions of this parent-child pair. The following observations have been made by comparing the codes on stages of design and types of participant interaction. This data was then triangulated participant feedback and my own journal notes. The observations are presented themed by the design stages used in the coding process with some general observations listed at the end of this section. -->

<!-- #### Discussion on design stages and GDP for this pair - DROP THIS?

 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.
 This parent was much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents. The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker/player type (concepts explored in previous chapter). This interpretation seems confirmed by less social interactions compared to may parents. The pair engaged far less in play testing of other games and peer support to overcome barriers. They also followed the stages of design more closely than may other groupings, an observation which is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

 This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." This alternation is driven or facilitated by the different stages of implementing GDPs. The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

 Using the coded data from nvivo to compare design cycle stages with pair collaboration, it can be observed that the most likely stages for pair collaboration were during the Ask/Imagine stage, Testing and Planning.

 The vignette shows evidence of that the actions of the parent to re-engage the child at different stages of the design cycle helped sustain the child's engagement in the more focused design process happening on the screen. However, an opposing pattern of behaviour may also be valid. When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups. Within Rogoff's model of community of learners [-@rogoff_developing_1994], this observation is viewed as valid form of participation. The child's ability to legitimately disengage from pair coding to observe the work and interactions of others in this emerging community of learners may also be sustaining.

 It is of note that when describing the design cycle for this family that this family along with others are working with decomposed smaller design challenges in the form of implementing GDPs. Thus the cycle is repeated for each new pattern that the pair take on. These smaller design iterations can be expressed within the framework of AT as an activity system. -->

 <!-- #### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

 NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION?
  NOTE - This more general observation may be part of the previous chapter

 We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

 - The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
 - This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

 Discussion

 - The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

 The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity. -->

<!-- This chapter has explored the affordances and potential of selected tools and processes in the context of in-person, family-based, game coding. As explored previously the literature on design for face-to-face communities which encourages community members to develop their own practices is sparse. -->

<!-- This section begins to explore observations in line with conceptions of authenticity and agency and other studies, identify processes to to aid researchers / practitioners replicate practice and understandings of the process. -->

<!-- I will extract observations from this research that extend beyond the process of coding into other domains.   -->

<!-- In this section analysis uses the language and concepts introduces in literature on affordances and transformational agency which in turn draws on concepts of conflicts in activity in activity theory. To help this process a quick recap of relevant concepts in relation to the contents of this chapter follows. -->

<!-- This study follows socio-cultural take that while objects have a forma of agency, affordances are not magic and become interesting to educators as part of activity stemming from human-initiated activity. -->



<!-- These include; authenticity of programming environment and language, use of the existing structure of the phaser library, the learning process of participants getting stuck and having to resolve tensions, my time limits providing individual support as a facilitator of a group, and the patience of participants when they encounter incomplete documentation. -->

<!-- While some areas of the design emerged in phase one, became a stable part of the design, (for example template and supporting documentation) other processes remained more flexible to interpretation and direction by participants; , playtesting, division of labour and use of home interests.   -->



<!-- #### Seeding community practices vs allowing open experimentation

While this has tricky implications for practitioners in more formal settings, there are tactics and tools which can help.  

DEVELOP THE ABOVE AS A SUMMARY OF THE PREVIOUS STAGES -->
<!-- The drama process aligns with particularly the use of a playful, fictional absent character called the Golem or Wizard that both young people and adults collude to keep real.  some of the aspects of the 5th Dimension project [@blunden2014seeking] [@blanton_effects_1997]   -->

<!-- The  marshalling towards certain goals to maintain a shared script / experience. -->

<!-- In Papert's [-@papert_gears_1980] study of his childhood play with gears he celebrated the joy of understanding processes hidden from others by taking apart and playing with technology.  -->




<!-- Because of the common use of design stages as a conceptual design tool.
And a prevalence of research linking design thinking  stages  and coding. I coded data to that. When coding data a design cycle framework was one of the code structures. Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share. However, when coding I quick became aware that naturalistic practice rarely matched the progression of the design cycle. The stages were instead fragmented and sometimes happened in parallel. -->


<!-- When designing program to prioritise learner engagement on to respond to their interests I found over structuring activity via design stages may be not be productive. The emerging process in this design related more closely to tinkering methodologies (previous explored). -->

<!-- However, while tinkering and improvisational approaches have been advocated in the domains of hands-on STEM exhibits in museums as part of the Maker movement, they have been less adopted in the domain of learning computer coding. -->

<!-- One side effect of coding by design cycle stage was to expose the limits of even an iterative cycle interpretation of the design process of these participants. -->
<!-- There is little data on the effectiveness of value even of explicitly teaching design thinking / engineering stages. -->
<!-- I did not give explicit facilitator input or guidance on the stages which may also have avoided norming participants towards such patterns. -->

<!-- Another cause for a less stuctured was the use of a templated game which contained andauthenticity which invited testing and sharing with after only quick changes. -->

<!-- I propose designing for more chaotic practices can increase agency as it reduces a feeling of prescription that may reduce a feeling of agency. -->

<!-- FIND MORE EVIDENCE FOR THIS. THIS IS LEARNER CHOICE OVER ACTIVITY / AND IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THINGS HAPPEN -->


<!-- While there is limited data as this was not a subject for participant interviews, and there is no comparative data here, this is an area that merits further investigation. There are parallels in existing research.
MOVE TO CONCLUSION THEN -->

<!-- While computer design stages taught using perspective stages approaches [Waterfall etc], there has been a more recent move towards agile, iterative approaches which allow for more flexible and responsive working processes. -->


<!-- In other areas of creative processes the concept of jamming is potentially useful as a grounding. -->



<!-- While design cycles was not an explicitly part of the game making instruction, certain interventions supported this approach. In particular the use of maps as a planning and reflection tool and the use of playtesting as a social and personal form of evaluation of emerging designs. -->
<!--
**Improving is Creating and Planning when remixing**

<!-- Implication one - When mapping the activity to a design cycle. There may not be neat matches and at some stage if the process is very fragmented the researcher or teacher can legitimately ask how valuable the design cycle is as a planning or analytical tool.

<!-- #### Designing to incorporate learner identity

NOTE - INCLUDE HOME ED CONTEXT TO AN EXTENT TO PRECEED LATER CAVEATS IN CONCLUSION

Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].

This chapter supports this research and also finds game making as  a suitable medium to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

Conceptually, within AT, these interventions and design choices which yield possibilities for self-exploration can be see as potential anchor points to increase learner agency.

In summary:

Family game making, of completing projects together with your parents or siblings has potential to remove the **I'm not that sort of person** barrier of cultural identity as participants are surrounded by their people.

  - the choice of retro games as a medium provokes sharing for older participants while their enduring popularity maintains common ground with younger participants;
- encouraing game playing and discuauthenticityssion of games helps surface positive affect and

This distinction is fluid as some tools and processes which emerged in community practice, prove to be successful and which are then adopted as a suggested process for the next iteration of the design.

We can note tension of restricting user choice in order to create more "visible anchor points" to increase potential for increasing the agency of learners. Like swimming in a protected pool rather than in the sea. This tension is explored more in following chapter.

The full process and rationale and initial reactions are detailed in appendix 4.x . In summary,

The process was very engaging, parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital identities of their children. As part of the process I then proposed that there different game maker types and asked participants to evaluate and discuss with peers what kind of game maker they were. From the following list.

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

This self evaluation helped confirm my own observations of different motivations driving different participation behaviours. Fuller discussion follows in chapter six.

The success of activity spurred the creation of the creation of side-missions to be carried out in from of a dramatic process.

### On Fluency

For example, creating a new graphical element in a separate online pixel-art editor called Piskel, exporting and downloading it to the laptop, and uploading it to the glitch code playground and then making code changes in several parts of the code to initialise and implement new behaviour for this element.

These tensions were were highlighted in the end of P1 feedback and in some practitioner interviews that I conducted. FIND THIS IF SO

In contrast in P2 and P3 there is flexibility of interaction  which suits informal moments of playtesting.

<!-- #### Why prioritise local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community - and how are they different in character? PERHAPS DROP IF NOT NEEDED OR KEEP REALLY SHORT. AND MERGE UP.

While a lot of other research has focused on community as an online phenomenon, in this research that aspect has not been explored.

This section explores my decision to prioritise local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community as well as  how are they different in character.

One reason was practical,  a suitable online community pitched at children or even at novices was not apparent using the chosen tools set.

The advantages of this decision is that interactions play out off the screen, the limited games available increase community interaction, as participants drew only from a small pool of locally created games.

While there is convincing research on on how online community  can engender feelings of agency and motivation [ROQUE AND ITO AND GEE], I chose not to connect with existing online communities in this learning design. Online communities can serve as a form of authentic feedback as explored in the Scratch and New Grounds community websites. However, the process of being involved in an online community and in addition learning the processes of participation diverts time and focus from other activities including real life playtesting.

In addition, the diversity of creations available on a online community may also have detracted from the more shared experience of the template used. Not offering a choice of starting game helped this shared technical and cultural base.      -->



####  MoE

One area of research which was explored in this learning design but which has needed to be deprioritise is that of Mantle of the Expert and the permission to play and experiment which the drama process advocates.

While a fuller exploration of how this was put into practice in P3 via a narrative which wrapped around the making activity, it is relevant to the use of side missions, and the possibility for character exploration in terms of a maker type.

#### **An example of mini TADS - use of secondary resources**
 <!-- REFLECTION ON BRICOLAGE? -->
An illustrative design tension emerged surrounding which kind of documentation to prioritise. After initially steering participants directly to code snippets, I subsequently directed them instead to step by step tutorials which also included a link to the code snippets. I shifted between prioritising instruction-based practices and more piecemeal, bricolage inspired (see LR) developer practices. Whilst the process of instruction is problematic in terms of learner agency this vies with the practicality to establish a common understanding and shared framework for production.

a theme explored in more detail in chapter five
Traditional, printed, instruction-based software manuals are in decline partly due online documentation but also due to the increased intuitive nature of their design [@pogue_user_2017].

vThe careful alignment between navigational documentation and the participants driving objectives of the mid-level activity system of implementing a game element, also helped avoid mismatch between task and tools described above as mismatch between primary and secondary stimuli.
The process aligns with the concept of just-in-time instruction.

**How broadly can the principles be applied?**

The general use of design patterns to guide digital creation are widely replicable, that of coupling documentation. The UMC methodology applies more broadly to design based education via prototyping. which could take other formats. Thus it is potentially applicable to other domains. And example of such is in PBL work using a campaign template and characteristics ads design patters, and a Poster, and elevator pitch feedback before creating then a stall [blog post].

<!-- This decreased need for secondary documentation minimises the possibility for task / tool mismatch.  As outlined above, to avoid the barriers experienced when searching authentic, developer-focused documentation and the support forums, I created  bespoke code examples in an online collection. -->

### 6. The impact of constraints in design on agency - NOT SURE  -MOVE to concluson?

CONSTRAINTS IN DESIGN?
While supporting a flexible learner pathway is vital to this approach, the value of restrictions to creativity are also important here. The restricted genre, pixel art format and templated approach act not only as technical  scaffolds but also aligns with research on the value of constraints in facilitating rapid creative improvisation in the areas of music and drama.

The domains of programming, game jams and hackathons also use constraints in a similar way [@gabler2005prototype]. Thus, I now explore the tools, process and the community in this study mutually encourage an flexible approach often referred to as _jamming_. As explored in Chapter 2 existing research suggests that Game Jams can be profitably used in education contexts [@aurava_game_2021], although there is no agreement on the characteristics game jam pedagogy, and scant guidance on how to address potentially problematic issues (list these),

MOVE LATER / CONCLUSION
The characteristics described above offer a contribution to the literature on Game Jam pedagogy and learning design of this study offers greater scaffolding to the process to facilitate the process of jamming as a way of encouraging co-development of practices and making styles as proposed by Gutiérrez and Rogoff [@gutierrez_cultural_2003]. This strand is developed in the following chapter.
