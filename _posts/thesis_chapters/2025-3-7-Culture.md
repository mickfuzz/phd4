## Introduction

This chapter deepens the analysis and discussion on RQ2 regarding the potential uses of gameplay design patterns (GDP) and concludes with an analysis and discussion on RQ3, addressing reflections on participant agency. Chapter 6 presented findings on the different uses of gameplay design patterns (GDP) using three foci of analysis: personal, social, and cultural activity. To begin, this chapter discusses these findings in relation to existing relevant research. Part one specifically addresses the complexities of the abstract and concrete dimensions of computing education using a concept from design research that explores the value of gameplay design patterns as an intermediate-level, pedagogical framework.  

Part two shifts focus away from individual conceptions of knowledge and skill to examine the broader empowerment-related motivations driving this study within socio-cultural conceptions of agency. The purpose here is to ground this discussion of the study's emergent cultural and interpersonal activity within the context of ongoing explorations into theoretical and practical applications of agency in socio-cultural research circles. To achieve this, I begin with an exploration of the study’s findings in relation to instrumental and transformative agency and the concept of mediation in CHAT. As a way to address cultural development in more depth, particularly the development of learner identities within the research activities, I develop an interpretation of relational agency drawing on Rogoff and Gutiérrez's [@gutierrez_cultural_2003] concept of learner repertoires. To present a holistic picture of the complex cultural activity recorded in the research data, this discussion briefly addresses the wider aspects of the learning design.  However, it concludes with a proposed contribution suggesting that a collection of GDPs can help participants and facilitators as both as component features of emerging game making repertoires and as a orienting framework to increase the inclusive characteristics of the learning environment. Part two ends with an exploration of metaphors that synthesise significant features of the learning design which influence dimensions of agency.  

The final part of this chapter returns to gaps in the research landscape and outlines two key areas of contribution to the field. Firstly, it presents an applied computing pedagogy structured around the use of GDPs. Secondly, it offers a complex interpretation of shifting forms of agency grounded in this case study. This second, more philosophical, contribution is also grounded in a utilitarian approach to design-based research and formative interventions. As such, it communicates practical concerns to inform future recommendations for practice.

<!-- **more intro material**

The chapter contains a discussion on wider concerns of designing for learner agency. Here I synthesise analysis on processes which support learners to develop agency in this game making community
(and the role of different levels of authenticity?)

This section takes a step back to explore the wider perspectives of the findings beyond the immediate context to digital making and project based approaches and understandings of design patterns in educational contexts.

An underlying proposal of this thesis is the development of  learner agency can be facilitated by designing effective learning environments. To do this I draw on key forms of developmental agency explored in Chapter 3.

This section synthesises findings learner agency in relation to existing conceptions of agency in other research.

This section explores these academic conceptions in a playful way using relatable metaphors from related research. The aim of this playful/relatable approach is to aid the situation of later recommendations for researchers and educators working in this area in an accessible way. -->

In chapter two I described the characteristics and limits of existing pedagogies in the domain of computer game design and programming (CGD&P) addressing conceptions of abstraction including computational thinking; the role of levels of abstraction for teachers and learners; and the value of epistemological pluralism as a way to value concrete approaches. The research process, in particular attempts in later stages to align with UK computing curricular concerns, provoked careful reflection on abstract-concrete dimensions of emerging knowledge happening in the game making and digital making more generally. The previous chapter began to explore, through the lens of personal appropriation, a variety of concepts and practices suitable for development via this learning design in the form of a map of learning dimensions.

This chapter section develops this line of thinking in two broad streams. Firstly, the research process and the evolving design involve a process of _rising to the concrete_, an analytical process involving identifying from concrete data an abstraction of interest and utility and leveraging the power of this concept to generate distinct concrete instantiations of it. Secondly, the tension between abstract and concrete dimension of the process of learning to program runs as a theme through the literature of this domain. This section ends by unifying these threads with a proposal of GDPs as an intermediate-level construct located between these poles, demonstrating their utility for educational designers, researchers and for participants.



<!-- surfacing a distinction between curricular contents commonly associated with a more abstract understandings of personal knowledge, including more abstract elements of computation thinking.  -->


To start, however, let us consider the nature of the utility of abstraction using this study's theoretical framework of activity theory. For Sannino' [-@sannino_activity_2011] distinction between empirical abstraction, described as "observation and categorization", and theoretical abstraction, characterised as "practical transformation, change, and experimentation". The utility of such theoretical abstraction lies in its ability to generate "concrete manifestations and developmental forms of the reality under scrutiny", hence the use of the term _germ cell_ [@sannino_activity_2011, p.590]. In this research, the empirical level of abstraction was most prevalent present in P1, D1 and P2 where features to be added to the game were classified as gameplay features and categorised. The nature of abstraction becomes more theoretical as I position each feature as a gameplay design pattern. The guiding conception is the pedagogical utility of a strongly coupled link between a feature of an observable game product (in this case gameplay design patterns) and scaffolding resources available within a community. This concept becomes the root of the varied approaches and forms of support outlined in Chapter 5 and in the resulting uses of GDPs in Chapter 6. The following section makes a parallel between the utility of germ cell concepts and so-called strong concepts or intermediate knowledge in design theory [@hook_strong_2012; @barendregt_intermediate-level_2018].


<!-- Some instances based on this kernel concept were created by myself in response to user requests in varied forms of support documentation outlined in Chapter 5 ( e.g. quick start card -->

 <!-- Design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework (compared to computational thinking) -->

<!-- While understanding the process is more obviously useful for faciliators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects. -->

<!-- Through this lens the most abstract activity system is the larger one who's objective, to make an engaging game that tells an environmental story, aligns with the problem level of LOA. The level between abstract and concrete is that of choosing, implementing and testing game design patterns, which aligns with design. The most concrete in this interpretation is then the implementation of different lines of code or creation and migration of digital assets. -->


### Exploration of GDPs as an intermediate-level construct in relation to other conceptions of abstraction in computing education research

As explored in Chapter 2, design patterns in computing contexts are presented as a middle ground between abstract theories (e.g. computational thinking) and more concrete techniques. "Formulations that are too abstract will be impractical in real design use; those that are too specific will be difficult to re-use in new scenarios." [@dearden_pattern_2006, p. 20].
Höök and Löwgren [@hook_strong_2012] illustrate this _midway_ concepts as heuristics or design patterns between concrete instances of products and more general theories e.g. constructivism [@stolterman_concept-driven_2010].

The work of Eriksson et al. [-@eriksson_using_2019, p.15] using gameplay design patterns with young people frame design patterns as "intermediate-level concepts", and used a curated collection of GDPs as a base for young people to input ideas for game redesign. There is still much work to be undertaken addressing the utility of GDPs to support novice programmers. The use of design patterns to support learning coding and has been explored chiefly on professional rather than novice learners. While work on design patterns to support novice game programmer exists, it focused main on transfer to science simulation [@repenning_scalable_2015] or analysis and assessment of code complexity [@werner_children_2014; @bienkowski2015assessment]. Before fully exploring my research using this framing of intermediate-level concept I address the role of conceptions of abstract and concrete in research within the domain of learning programming: specifically I address computational thinking, levels of abstraction (LOA), and epistemological pluralism including succinct analysis the findings of this research using those concepts.


<!-- An alignment in this framing from the design research community with CHAT interpretation of the utility of a germ cell construct can be made in terms of the utility of the process and the process of divining a abstract enough germ cell to merit application in other instances. -->

<!-- A similar interpretation is adopted by a grouping of HCI researchers exploring the value of "intermediate-level concepts" [@barendregt_intermediate-level_2018; @hook_strong_2012], as a form of "representation of knowledge in-between general theories and particular artefacts in terms of abstraction and generalizability" [@eriksson_using_2019, p.15].  -->




##### Computational thinking

<!-- The term abstraction has varied interpretation even within the field of computer science education [@hazzan_reducing_2002]. -->

<!-- To ground this in GCSE examples.
Iteration and Selection are in the gcse example, tick examples of them. Just recognise. -->

Chapter 2 explores definitions of computational thinking varying in degrees of abstraction or application. Two notably interpretations include Wing's [wing_computational_2006] focus on abstraction encompassing as overarching computing principles and high level structural design approaches, and Resnick and Brennan's [@brennan_new_2012] more applied approach including _computational practices_ and perspectives. Wing's emphasis on the importance of the explicit teaching of skills of decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking, contribution on computational thinking is  more theoretical than applied and invites discussion on how best to teach this abstract approach to computation thinking. Grover [@grover_computational_2017; @grover_computational_2013] and Guzdial [@guzdial_learner-centered_2015] offer explicit techniques linked using computer code as the driving mechanism. Bell and colleagues [@bell2019constructing] explore the process of unplugged activities, exploring abstract CT concepts without using computers or coding.

This learning design takes a fundamentally different approach by avoiding the explicit teaching of these more abstract dimensions of CT. Abstract aspects of CT are strongly scaffolded: for example the process of code decomposition via the pre-existing functions in the code template, and abstraction again in template via the graphical design tool. The subsequent structuring of the of core learning design around a collection of GDPs coupling description and implementation also involves the processes of decomposition and pattern recognition. Thus, while the process was collaborative in goal formation the heavy lifting was carried out by myself, a decision justified by focusing on more relational elements of the learning design aligned with agency addressed by RQ3. Thus in the context of this study, Wing's CT framework is applicable some of the code creation processes I have undertaken as a learning designer, but is less relevant to participants.




<!-- The more concrete elements of CT definition [@brennan_new_2012], which exist on a more applied level, are readily observed in the data are explored in the appendix on learning map, -->


<!-- What has this research got to say about the relationship between the two? -->
<!-- **In terms of recommendations for researchers / practitioners of an intermediate framework:** -->
<!-- As such this research has only more theoretical propositions rather than participant data. -->

##### Levels of Abstraction

While Waite and colleagues also propose that abstraction should be explicitly taught, even to younger pupils [@waite_abstraction_2016], their approach to abstraction [@waite_abstraction_2018-1] is distinct from Wing's in that it is grounded in an operationalised computational model distinguishing levels of abstraction: specifically, in descending order of abstraction, the goal or problem to be solved, the designed structure of the program, the actual coding of that design, and at the most concrete level, the running of the code and its outputs [@waite_abstraction_2018-1] (see Table 7.1). Wing's CT concepts within the LOA model would lie at the design level. This advocacy for the utility of awareness of levels of abstraction, based on research indicating its efficacy in supporting learning programming [@cutts2012abstraction; @statter_teaching_2016], cites the value of learners knowing at what level of abstraction they are operating and their fluency in movement between the levels. Waite and Sentance's later work [@sentance_primm_2017] synthesises this interpretation of levels of abstraction with the concept of semantic profiles to create an applied pedagogy for computing education aligned with a UK curricular context. This work highlights the potential role of alternating between abstract and concrete concepts in semantic waves aimed at helping teachers design learning experiences which in part allow for participant shifts in LOA perspectives. In their PRIMM pedagogy the researchers also incorporate the UMC model and draw parallels with LOA. In the Use stage of the UMC model [@lee_computational_2011] (explored in Chapter 5 in relation to this research's learning design), participants would be aware of the goal of the program, and the results. Subsequently, in the Modify stage they would become familiar with the design and code levels.

Turning to a synthesis of my finding with those of Waite et al on levels of abstraction, while the teaching of the theories levels of abstraction is not explicit, movement is clearly happening, as demonstrated by the table below.


| **Level**            | **Focus** | **Example** |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Conceptual Level**  | Thinking about the GDPs to be added to the game | Goal formation, prioritisation |
| **Design Level**  | GDP supporting documentation scaffolds this process  | What it should do is to a large extent preset via documentation. |
| **Code Level**  | Writing the actual code, is supported via code patching  | is supported via code patching, and a structure which encourages modification |
| **Execution Level**  | Understanding the outputs | A strong correlation between goal and outcome, as playing the game product is very immediate. |

Table. 2.x Breakdown or Table of levels of abstraction. [@waite_abstraction_2018]

With this focus, we can analyse my learning design where movement between layers of abstraction and concrete is happening. However, rather than a neat semantic sine wave as depicted in Fig 2.x in Chapter 2, for my participants, such shift are often rapidly and  chaotically structured.

THIS AREA MAY NEED MORE DEVELOPMENT VIA EXAMPLES

<!-- Further analysis of my learning design in relation to the concept of LOA follows, after an exploration of abstract and concrete learning approaches in the work of Papert and colleagues in the following section. -->

<!-- THIS DEPENDS ON WHAT THE CONCEPTION OF ABSTRACTION IS HERE -->

##### Epistemological pluralism, bricolage & Microworlds

In Chapter 2, the concepts and legacy of Papert and Turkle's [-@papert_epistemological_1990] exploration of diversity in coding approaches are introduced through what they call epistemological pluralism. The focus here is on their championing of approaches beyond the dominant formal, abstract approach that "emphasizes control through structure and planning" [@papert_epistemological_1990, p.134]. This approach can be characterised by the following: a top-down design process involving extensive planning prior to coding, explicit teaching of language principles and syntax, and coding from scratch rather than altering existing products. To counter this dominance, Papert and Turkle [-@papert_epistemological_1990] highlighted the value of a more concrete computing pedagogy, likening the process to bricolage, a craft-based approach where participants become very familiar with their tools and materials. The authors' exploration of the types of coders as either Planners or Bricoleurs aligns with two aspects of the making styles explored briefly in Chapter 5. Bricoleur types are described as preferring to stay in closer contact with a concrete sense of the outcomes even at the expense of programming efficiency or neatness of code. This advocacy for the bricolage approach which remains anchored in concrete construction, appears at odds with Waite and Curzon's [@curzon_using_2020] research on the importance of alternating between abstract and concrete dimensions, present in research on semantic waves.

My research is relevant here in that my observations show many of my participants operating as bricoleurs, feeling their way through their game-making via smaller-scale iterations rather than extensive periods of planning followed by implementation. It should be recalled, however, that this process is encouraged by the structuring of the learning design. Returning to semantic waves, while exploration of abstract CT concepts may be lacking in the process, an interpretation of video data findings shows that the shifts in LOA that Waite and colleagues advocate are present, with frequent shifts between conceptions of goals, implementation in code structures, and observations of results happening. It is relevant then to distinguish the levels of abstraction present in this process: namely, perhaps, Wing's and Papert's conceptions of abstraction, present in top-down planning processes, and the goal-results hierarchy present in the LOA framework. It is within the design level of LOA that such distinctions persist, as Bricoleurs would avoid abstract design structures which detract from a close relationship between the code and the desired results. It can be seen at this point that such a coupling matches the structure of design patterns, indicating a suitability for their use to support this more concrete approach to developing programming.

The celebration here is of pluralism rather than the culturally prevalent perspective privileging abstraction. Abstraction is not seen as undesirable, and indeed, is present in much of Papert's work. For example, the importance of reducing barriers to learning coding through structural abstraction and thus the simplification of learning environments. Papert's focus on reducing barriers to participation is present in his focus on child-play as a leading activity rather than teacher-led instruction. This simple but radical perspective also drives some of the foundational work on Microworlds, using the LOGO language as a vehicle to make previously abstract mathematical concepts concrete through exploratory play [@papert_mindstorms_1980]. This perspective continues to drive constructionist design approaches supporting creative computing [@resnick_design_2005; @resnick_scratch_2009; @kafai_constructionism_1996; @kafai_constructionism_1996; @kafai_minds_1994; @lee_playing_2014; @peppler_makeology:_2016]. A component aspect within this approach is the careful consideration of the process of abstraction or black-boxing in learning design and tools [@resnick_reflections_2005], which is of direct relevance to my research. Specifically, these concerns are present in my design of the use of a code playground as a supporting tool, the use of a starting template with pre-created code functions in place, the structuring of the template with key variables moved to the start of the code, and a grid matrix in an array data structure.


<!-- THIS NEEDS WORK - MORE ON MY EXAMPLES - CHECK BELOW TO MOVE UP? -->

While this abstraction in my design is important to the experience of participants and the practicality of tackling a game-making project with novices, in the following section I return to address the utility of framing the design element of the use of GDPs as intermediate-level frameworks.



<!-- Their celebration of concrete coding approaches, including the use of tangible physical and digital objects, and more piecemeal, bricolage approach has influenced the design of popular educational programming software and pedagogy through the constructionist school and maker movements (as explored in the literature review). -->

<!--

move to lit review?
However, Wilensky [-@wilensky1991abstract] questions the nature of abstract in this context arguing that all objects and concepts are abstract until familiarity makes them more concrete to the user. -->


<!-- #### In SUMMARY

Thus in summary conceptions of abstraction above explored above include:

- Wing's take on computational thinking: abstraction, decomposition, generalisation / pattern recognition, implementation via an algorithmic process.
- A more holistic practice-based definition from Resnick, Brennan -
- Waite's LOA - abstract here drawing on levels within the problem or product  - navigation between levels, explicit teaching of such navigation. -->

### Observations on abstract / concrete dimensions in my data related to gameplay design patterns.

<!-- 1. positioning as intermediate
2.  looking at distinction in different studies in context -->


I now return to the proposal of GDPs as a useful intermediate-level framework, given the framing of abstraction summarized above, and explore this proposal using the findings of my research process. To do this, it is useful to re-examine the utility of the term "intermediate framework" [@eriksson_using_2019], given the exploration of LOA, semantic waves, and Papert's work. Does the framework provided by GDPs sit between a more abstract theory and concrete implementation as given? Waite's conception of LOA would place the implementation of each GDP at the highest level of abstraction, whereas the more potentially transferable nature of Wing's abstract CT conceptions would form a candidate for a more generalisable theory. As such, GDPs would be situated between those and concrete implementation. To illuminate this positioning, we can examine the above-cited research in the field of human-computer interaction [@eriksson_using_2019; @hook_strong_2012; @barendregt_intermediate-level_2018]; however, in most of these studies, the nature of the general theories is not clearly articulated.

At this stage, it is valuable to look past a potentially arbitrary placing of these levels within a hierarchy to investigate instead the core value of the relational nature of the framework to other concepts in the context of my research. To help with this analysis of utility, the following section develops this line of research, making more explicit the observed and potential uses of GDPs for different stakeholders in this context: specifically, comparing their utility for participants and facilitators/researchers.



<!-- To explore the findings of last chapter in relation to this exploration of the nature and purpose of abstraction in guiding frameworks in learning programming, I return to research on the use of gameplay design patterns. -->

<!-- Thus


This is the motivational aspect of framework?

a. As a research framework - Eriksson et al.
b. A facilitator / design framework -
c. as a participant framework for navigation and goal formation as explored in the previous chapter. -->

<!-- Addressing the first aspect, the process of rising the concrete outlined above is helpful not just for analysis (a) but also for ongoing pedagogical design (b).

The third aspect c, can be returned to, but where and when in this chapter? Points follow:
- the link with the experienced feature of the game / product as a framework increases inclusive nature of process (later?)

PERHAPS MOVE THIS TO NEXT SECTION
What about semantic waves and movement. How explicit does the understanding of the motion between poles need to be? For example in my design, it is not very explicit of guided towards. However, this may be different in different UK computing settings.

This potential non-alignment with UK non-formal may be a limitation in the take up of this research.   -->


<!-- #### Addressing utility for participants -->

<!-- One of the more developed work in GDP as such a framework is in Eriksson et al. The context of their GDP study is distinct in that whereas the young people in the Stringforce study are making design suggestions to alter a game they are not making their own games by modifying computer code. -->
<!-- In my design by contrast there is strong coupling between the role, description and implementation as illustrated by the structure of the supporting resources outlined in Chapter 5. -->

Addressing utility for participants, in computing education, design pattern-based approaches have benefits in making complex problems more modular and concrete [@muller_almost_2004-1; @waite_teaching_2021]. In the work of Eriksson et al., the young people make design suggestions to alter a game but do not modify computer code. This distinction is important because it removes the strongly coupled link (present in this design) between motivation, description, and implementation, articulated as a problem-solution structure that is present in conventional conceptions of design patterns. This coupling bears examination in relation to the positioning of GDPs as a leading activity, as illustrated by my decision to treat the implementation of each GDP as an activity system in itself. While the previous chapter explored the use of GDPs in various facets, this section turns to their utility for learners in this abstract/concrete domain.  

Firstly, GDPs are particularly helpful in participant goal formation, as explored in Chapter 6 in the sections on ideation and prioritisation. Secondly, the close coupling in patterns strongly supports the navigation between different project stages (explored in this chapter as LOA) via careful structuring of resources and documentation. Thirdly, GDPs help with the division of labour between collaborators, which is relevant here. For example, when tackling more abstract processes, concepts, and terminology. These roles are often taken on by a more competent partner. Thus, participant perspectives shift between the wider goal of making an engaging game for a real or imagined audience and a narrower goal of implementing a game design pattern and the technical actions and operations needed to complete it.  

<!-- Reflections in progression of design in P4 showed my reluctance to lead with or explicitly teach abstract concepts with CT. Further discussion on the dilemma of how explicit teaching of computational concepts should be in taken up in the following section addressing the perspective for designers / teachers. -->
<!-- #### Turning to the utility for designers, reearcher and facilitators,  -->

Turning to the utility for designers, researchers and facilitators, it follows that the concerns above are also relevant for this group of stakeholders in terms of supporting learners. GDPs can also be useful for wider pedagogical and analytical motivations. One such motivation is the ability for a solid understanding of GDPs to open up exploration of other concepts. This potential is expressed as a challenge by Barron, in research on project-based approaches to digital making, a key challenge to project based learning: specifically the challenge of is finding appropriate conceptual and practical frameworks to scaffold domain specific working practices to ameliorate the dialectical tension between engagement via tinkering and requirements to promote "principled understanding" [@barron_doing_1998, p.63].

My reflections on research data support a proposition that there is utility for facilitators to be aware of the level of abstraction present in different elements of project learning design. This value encompasses both the concepts that learners are working with and those which are potentially accessible via explicit teaching. The close coupling between design and code structure levels in my design may not align with LOA principles given that "1:1 mapping between the design/algorithm and the code may lead to confusion between the levels" [@waite_abstraction_2018-1, p.21]. However, given that Waite's subsequent research does not include examples of activity explicitly teaching abstraction [@waite_abstraction_2018-1; @sentance_teachers_2019; @sentance_teaching_2019], what counts as explicit teaching of abstraction is not clear. This question invites discussion on the value of explicit teaching CT of compared to development as as an embedded skill through bricolage approaches. As explored in Chapter 2 the literature review paints a very mixed picture in this regard and while it is problematised in relation to agency development later, this research doesn't negate the value of explicit teaching of computational thinking, Additionally, this research contends that GDPs are a more suitable accessible leading pedagogical framework than computational thinking, a proposal explored in the following section.

<!-- If a knowledge of CT is needed by the learning context then it could be profitably explored in other ways. For example, developing resources suitable for such reflection,  for instance a learning map to be used by participants and teachers as explred in P4 . Linking from docs to descriptions of the characteristics. Thus not a leading pedagogical framework but a map of possible skills and concepts made possible by the leading activity. -->



<!--
My own notes and reflections (see appendix.learning in particular) map cautioned me against explicit teaching of abstraction and imposing shifts in perspectives for fear of interrupting the flow of participant making. In this context I judged the imposition of an additional goal of understanding abstract curricular concepts as potentially counter productive to the overall aim of acculturation to game making tools and processes and developing an inclusive idioculture.

IS THIS DOUBLED / DUPLICATED?
However this research contends that GDPs are a more suitable accessible  framework than that of computational thinking when making games and as such should be the leading  and guiding pedagogical framework. If a knowledge of CT is needed by the learning context then it could be profitably explored in other ways. For example, developing resources suitable for such reflection,  for instance a learning map to be used by participants and teachers as explred in P4 . Linking from docs to descriptions of the characteristics. Thus not a leading pedagogical framework but a map of possible skills and concepts made possible by the leading activity. -->




<!-- Route-based activities with a 1:1 mapping between the design/algorithm and the code may lead to confusion between the levels. -->
<!-- I had a reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge. My concern also reflected potential disorientation and reduced experiences of agency from imposed shifts of focus rather than self-initiated ones. I also propose that to further research to would be needed to justify the utility take the time to interrupt flow to explicitly teach abstraction, and abstract CT concepts, apart from if understanding of such concepts are required by curriculum constraints. -->


<!-- BUT WHAT ABOUT LEARNERS? HERE THE PERSPECTIVE IS BLURRED IF TEACHERS ARE STEERING TOWARDS A CURRICULUM. -->

<!-- As synthesis, in terms of semantic waves, the movement between abstract and concrete is helpful to address some of the issues concerning inclusion and accessibility of overly abstract approaches [@papert_epistemological_1990].
 -->


### How my research contributes to discussions regarding dimensions of abstraction within existing research

The evidence and examples surfaced in this paragraph support a view of a collection of GDPs as a productive research and pedagogical framework. The data from the last chapter contributes a series of grounded pedagogical instances via examples that map a concrete pedagogical process to theoretical observations. Eriksson et al. note the utility of GDP concepts in several dimensions: as a lingua franca between researchers and participants; to aid the framing of analysis; and to inspire participants. However, given that the focus of this analysis addresses the utility for the researcher rather than that of participants, this research significantly advances these contributions. Additionally, given this shift to include the utility for participants and the problematisation of the term intermediate, I propose a change in terminology. Instead of an _intermediate framework_, I propose the term _gateway framework_ to avoid the confusion explored earlier in terms of its position within a hierarchy.


Within this line of inquiry concerning navigation of different levels of abstraction within this process, the characteristics of such a gateway framework would usefully include the following elements. Firstly, the process guides learners to use GDPs as their primary leading activity or object of activity (using CHAT terminology). Secondly, a working code framework or template is provided with affordances strongly coupled with object output, providing immediate feedback. Thirdly, just-in-time supporting resources are provided, closely aligned to the sub-goals of GDPs. Finally, this gateway framework may also facilitate reflection on its use, and reinforcement of this process can be structured using supporting tools, such as a learning map (see appendix.learningmap for an example in P4).

In the previous analysis of the use of GDPs through the lens of research on the abstract and concrete dimensions in computing education, there is an alignment with the personal dimension of knowledge highlighted in the previous chapter. For participants, the framework of GDPs facilitates goal formation. Once engaged with this goal, participants can use the affordances of the design to traverse different LOA without explicit instruction in the process of playtesting. The following section develops an analysis of the findings from the last chapter, outlining the potential of GDP concepts, especially within playtesting, to support these participant shifts in perspective. The following section addresses the social and cultural aspects of this study, using the development of varied forms of participant agency as an analytical lens.

<!-- PERHAPS BRING UP UP TO DATE ISSUE OF TRANSFER. - BUT PERHAPS LEAVE FOR CONCLUSION. NOTE ALSO THE BALANCE BETWEEN CT CONCRETE SKILLS AND TRANSFER IN [@kynigos_modifying_2020] -->

<!-- However this does not detract from the value of learners navigating different LOA in following their interests.
Leading with GDPs as a framework appears to support this  navigation, and at times in this research it is undertaken fluently and joyfully. -->

<!-- While I address areas for future research in the conclusion, a proposed benefit of this research is While understanding the process is more obviously useful for facilitators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects. To underscore the potential and to uncover a starting point for pedagogies that can be transferred to diverse design projects. -->

<!-- 5. DROP /MOVE TO CH.3? The kedging metaphor and the climbing wall metaphor - in relation to agency and design -  explore them, kedging is a bit flailing , wall less so -->

As noted in Chapter 2, much research on the learning to code has focused chiefly on this aspect of personal knowledge construction, neglecting this social and socio-cultural perspectives typified by socio-cultural approaches [find source]. This trend is exemplified by a comparison of Wing and Papert's conceptions of computational thinking [@lodi_computational_2021], with the latter's additional focus on the community application of created projects forming the motivational basis of much of constructionism in the process of creating objects to share. Thus, the issue at hand transcends concepts of efficacy of how to support the coding process to address the underlying goals of the activity. Following the legacy of constructionism to the present day, the articulation of Resnick on computational fluency, addresses the limitations of research focusing too narrowly on technical approaches rather than their expressive potential (and thus within a community) [@resnick_coding_2020] and focused on toolsets rather than pedagogies [@resnick_seeds_2020]. We should recall here the parallel call of Kafai and Burke in the field of game making for learning to address social and cultural motivations and aspects of the process [@kafai_constructionist_2015]. Given that a guiding motivation of this study to explore the process of designing and facilitating for participant empowerment learning to program, it is valuable to articulate different types of agency. The following sections are structured a synthesis of the approaches of Hopwood [@hopwood_agency_2022] and Matusov [@matusov_mapping_2016] explored in Chapter 4, specifically instrumental, transformational and relational agency.


<!-- In a UK computing education context, while the work of Waite and Sentence begins to address sociocultural aspects of teaching programming [@sentance_teaching_2019; @hwang_using_2023], this work focuses on the PRIMM  and thus invites further exploration. -->

<!-- ### Justifying the use of Metaphors in these FINDINGS - CONCLUSION?

<!-- REMOVE THIS DUPLICATE EXAMPLE .
For example in my design:
Introducing additional tools in the form of documentation to the initial coding environment and template provided in early stages introduced tensions between the opportunities for independent development and the additional complexity of the process. -->


### Instrumental and transformational agency

The exploration of tensions in Chapter 5 summary, design decisions of tool use can to increase agency in practical terms by providing affordances or by removing barriers to use. Conceptually these practical dimension can be framed as instrumental agency or removing aspects of negative liberty caused by technical barriers [@matusov_mapping_2016, p. 433].  Chapter 6 outlined examples of mediation and instrumental agency in the use of GDPs aligned often with a personal appropriation (are shown in varied forms in Table 6.1). The process of abstraction of complexity explored above would also fall into this category. Examples of designed attempts to facilitate instrumental agency would be steps taken the resolution of tensions surrounding authenticity of coding web development language, coding environment and documentation.

A distinction can be made with and a transformative agency   [@isaac_cultural_2022], in that expression of instrumental agency are unlikely to provoke environment changes in the activity system at hand. Thus instrumental agency in education can be viewed as an uncomplicated view of mediation as a means to achieve pre-set goals. Thus designing for instrumental agency is often framed within an instruction or school setting.

In line with collective conceptions of agency explore in in Chapter to, transformational agency may stem from transcending individual motivation  but also involves a transformation to systemic constraints. As outlined in chapter 3, Sannino explains TADS using a metaphor of a using a kedging anchors [@hopwood_agency_2022]. In this metaphor the act of casting out the anchor is a visible act of volition which aims overcome conflicts blocking activity progress.

While affordances for mediation in conceptions of instrumental agency may be visible within the learning community, this metaphor encompasses a sense of the exploratory nature of the transformation, and that the leverage or catching point for change may not be immediately visible to activity participants in the activity system. The process may serve to surface previously unknown forms of mediation and use of tools not only for those undertaking this volitional activity but also others in the learning community.

Understandably, examples of this process in the research process were prevalent in early stages where participants had access to little in terms of supporting resources. Illustrative attempts of TADS are present in (Appendix.design.p1). For example, email correspondence from myself to participants asking for help in organising project work resulting in the emergence of list of proto-typical GDPs. Additionally the process of leading with exploration of a half-baked template was an experimental response from feedback from participants requesting more hand-on work with the tools before beginning planning. Thus emergence, via interaction between participants and myself, of and the use of a half baked template and GDPs as a suggested leading activity and pedagogical framework is a manifestation of transformational agency.

**Engendering transformative agency**

As a designer I began to noticed acts of volition to adapt the game making process, for example in adapting the game to add sound and characters of interest. In preparation for P2, to aid learners evolving activity, and then tried to add explicit affordances and make them visible to learners.

The process is on-going and mutual. Additionally, this work happens in an facilitated environment. Design decisions server to clarify common problems areas, thus making the water clearer to better see anchor points.
Integrate research on engendering authorial and transformative agency [@engestrom2006development; @haapasaari_emergence_2016; @sannino_formative_2016].

### Relational agency

The process of developing new repertoires is not a solo process. The complex relations between participants outlined in the vignettes and data of the last chapter, in particular that in guided participation and cultural activity, demonstrate  interdependence characteristic of relational agency.

Edwards  [@edwards2009systemic] explores relational agency within a CHAT framework as transcending individuals capacity to encompass collective problems solving via specialisation and diversity of approaches within activity systems. As a collective participants can overcome systemic contradictions via expansive learning, rearranging working relationships and thus opening new forms of relational agency. This concept is illustrated by the importance of feedback in community making and tinkering activities leading to increased "relational expertise" in partipants [@digiacomo_relational_2016-1 , p.144],

### Shifting forms of agency

This interpretation highlights possible shifts in forms of agency and an emerging dilemma in the evolving learning design. Initial blocks are solved by transformative agency, patterns and tools become established in the community, and agency shifts to and more instrumental.

| **Name** | Transformative Agency | Instrumental Agency | Relational Agency |
|----|-------------|----------------|---------------|
|**Characteristics:**|  When participants are blocked from progressing or what to move their work in an new direction | Instrumental agency is present in the straight-forward mediational use of existing written instructions and in-template affordances. | Relational agency is present in the interactions between participants asking for help, sharing developing expertise, and via incorporation of home interests in new repertoires of practice  |
| **When shown:** |  In P1 before written instructions were available. Also in P3 when diverting from the existing template paradigm (V?). | Present from P2 onwards.  | Relational agency is present in P2 where forms of it emerge organically during playtesting and in P3 where it is also structured by introduced activities  |
| **Examples:** | In P1 participants suggest the use of lists of features as a key organising tool, a process culminating in a collection of GDPs.  In P3 Toby and Dan make a maze game instead of a platformer game (V?). | Examples: in use of quick start activities, and in V2 Toby use of written instructions | In the following vignettes  |


Table. 2.x Characterisation of types of agency in the design


### Implications for design & a contribution proposal

In the introduction I outlined that a driving motivation of this research was to better understand chaotic learning environments, of which P1 is an example. Given this draw to conditions of TA, such shifting forms of agency could create a resulting tension.

As a learning designer, design decisions to reduce practical tensions, increase the instrumental agency of learners allowing them to experience a feeling of control over their creative process. However, in adapting designs, and thus increasing affordances and instrumental agency here is a danger of designing away the possibility for transformational agency.

To retain this potential for transformation it may be advantageous to keep some key areas of the learning design should be more open in structure to encourage the emergence of participant responses and novel practices. Evidence of this exists, beyond P1, there were still spaces for TA once the core pedagogy is in place. For example, in Vig. Tody and Dan the break out of the template to create a different genre.

Also, not everyone like messy / sketchy pedagogies, there is a danger that  levels of stress for participants may reduce the inclusivity.

**Gap in research:** At this point we can readdress one of the gaps addressed by the problem statement of the thesis: The importance of designing for agency and lack of studies which do that using socio-cultural perspectives.  

The following discussion section reframes and analyses data in relation to existing research, drawing on concepts of FOK, third spaces and repertoires of practice.

It concludes by proposing that understandings of CGD&P pedagogies can be enriched in two dimensions, firstly in design and secondly in a deeper theoretical understanding of concepts of agency development.

### 2c - Relational Agency in emergent activities in emergent cultural context - 3rd Spaces, idiocultures, and repertoires

**Structuring this section:**

1. Overview / recap of relational agency and repertoires, equity and diversity
2. Playtesting as the medium (perhaps swap with 2. )
3. Examples, Fok in v.6. DOL, and more in the data (not all playtesting)
4. Variations in playtesting styles
5. Intervention to encourage player styles


<!-- In the last section using TADS and mediation helps analyse findings in personal (and guided participation) aspects of Chapter 6.  -->
<!-- POSSIBLY?
This helps inform a distinction between FI and SDE,
Whereas FI do x, SDE do y? <- too much.. -->

This section moves beyond instrumental and transformative agency to a wider more ecological interpretation of agency helpful in deeper analysis of the cultural plane of activity. In research which addresses participant agency, Gutiérrez et al. [@gutierrez_youth_2019-1] incorporate broader cultural factors including issues of participant identity and movement of practices between learning settings. While this work build on the foundation of 3GAT in terms of conceptions of interacting activity systems [@engestrom_development_1996], it adds concept of repertoire and third spaces.



<!-- This section contends that relational agency is the closest fit to match the development of these three elements but will complexify this via comparative analysis with transformational agency in the final section. -->

<!-- This section explores the findings of previous chapters using three of these concepts of that or third spaces, idiocultures and repertoires of practice.

#### 1. Repertoires and relational agency

<!-- What are repertoires and why are they so important to this study?: -->


As explored in Chapter 3 Rogoff and Gutiérrez contribute to discussion of expansive learning in CHAT with the concepts of repertoire formation to both, a< provide recognition of the way learners bring home practices into learning spaces, and as a positive enacted demonstration of diversity in learning practices. The associated concept of hybridity as a way of recognising and deploying diversity of mediational tactics and resources in learning contexts [@gutierrez_rethinking_1999] is relevant to this research as a pathway into an exploration of the competing alternate goals within the overall motivation of making a game to share, and component goals of implementing GDPs to do this.

Gutiérrez's [@gutierrez_developing_2008] focus on the movement of identity between settings' repertoires of practice draws on the importance of a wider cultural focus of the learning process, or the “cultural mediation of thinking” (Moll, 1998), cited in [@digiacomo_seven_2017] p.44. Gutiérrez sees a role for facilitators to facilitate this via learning design.

In the last chapter, data on activity on the cultural plane exposed elements of transfer between different activity systems, supporting Gutiérrez's [@gutierrez_developing_2008] perspective regarding the importance of transcending borders and linguistic practices between sites of learning. SO WHAT?

The data of this study provides a strong case study, evidence and detail to this process in the use of external repertoires and their remediation into new repertoires.
WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY HERE IS THIS IT? IS THIS A GAP ? ARE MORE CASE STUDIES NEEDED?



<!-- In the context of my study the role of forllowing design features of the learning environment bear greater exploration.

- the use of GDPs in the development of new  repertoires?
- the role playtesting in development of relational agency  
- analysis of additional activities helping the development of learner identities -->


While the data in the last chapter address aspects / elements of repertoires which incorporated GDPs, this chapter widens the focus of data examined to include other element of practices which help participants incorporated home repertoires as an inclusive practice.

**Turning to identity:**,
The relationship between developing effective repertoires and the affective relationship to the activity relies on the participants being able to identify with the ongoing activity   thus informing a processes of inclusion.

Barron's helping roles [@barron_parents_2009], Roque [@roque_family_2016; @roque_im_2016] employed supporting facilitators to highlight and celebrate the helping processes parents used to support children in a making environment.

Thus while under explored in existing research in CGD&P, it is of value to explore the process of design for identity development via supporting repertoire blending, in particular, due teh focus of this study in non-formal settings communities - [] FIND SUPPORT

#### 2. Playtesting as a suitable medium for emerging activities creating third spaces

Playtesting as an incubator for emerging cultural activities, has been crucial to the development of later stages of this learning design. The sum of introdued and emerging elements of repertoires can be framed as constituting the development of a particular game making idioculture.

As explored in the literature review, playtesting is a process common to game making which corresponds to the evaluation phase of design thinking cycles and the process of user testing in HCI [@fullerton_game_2018].

The role of play as leading activity is explored by Gutierrez [@gutierrez_learning_2019-1] to facilitate movement between sites of learning

An analysis on the role of playtesting and an emerging forms of playful playtesting follows.

<!-- In this section, I recall data to describe some of the emerging playtesting behaviours of participants in relation to the introduced learning design. -->




#### 3. Examples: Funds of Knowledge / DoL repertoires and how they emerge (in playtesting practices in particular)

One of they key findings of the previous chapter is the diverse use of GDP concepts within processes which allowed participant to incorporate practices and interests from home life or other spaces. Most notably this is seen within the sections on divisions of labour and use of funds of knowledge and identity. Examples include: being the identification with graphical art and the development of specialism in Madiha's family, the general use of game playing knowledge, home pedagogies like paper based sketching and more professional knowledge brought by Dan. This blending of the use of GDP concepts, in-template affordence, supporting resources, with such knowledge and practices from other activity systems can be analysed using the concept of repertoires. Rogoff and Gutierrez's initial motivation in their exploration of repertoires was to challenge simplistic, overgeneralising approaches regarding learning styles especially if applied to non-dominant communities [@gutierrez_cultural_2003]. The researchers highlight the value of identifying potential funds of knowledge framed as "linguistic and cultural-historical repertoires" that learners bring to learning environments [@gutierrez_cultural_2003, p.22]. Other research by Gutierrez addresses the importance of participants movement between sites of activity and its impact on learning [@gutierrez_developing_2008; @gutierrez_learning_2019-1].

 <!-- Examples include.... -->



<!-- In this section, I recall data to describe some of the emerging playtesting behaviours of participants in relation to the introduced learning design. -->

#### 4. Variations in approaches to playtesting

Some participants refrained from extensive testing of other games, waiting for others to test their games and observing their responses. Others were very social in their playtesting approach. Madiha making very positive comments on design of player characters and building relations in that way. The last chapter showed that some participants used playtesting as a way to gain idea of what to add to their game next and to ask for direct help in that process.  

Some children added additional playful elements to playtesting (see Appendix.playtestingtypes).  Playtesting surfaced design practices which involved a playing against game design norms of the genre.

Some in particular brought a physicality to the process, clustering in a particular zone of the class, referencing the game play elements, acting them out, attempting to change the games of others and playful tussling as part of resistance to those changes.

Playtesting acted as a stimulus and incubator for emerging socio-cultural practices prompting me to ask if suitable affordances be added to the design to encourage their further growth in line with Gutiérrez's valuing of the inclusive, diverse properties of hybridity in practices [@gutierrez_rethinking_1999].

I observed an evolution of the form and function of playtesting by young participants as an expression of agency by participants.

COMMENT  - This evolution maker types here exists especially in social makers, glitchers and magpies.


Within more narrowly defined game making activities centred around altering code and assets of their products, learners who had mastered certain specialist skills were asked by others for help. Their developing roles as domain experts provided additional affordances in the learning community and building an identify as specialist within it.


The introduction of these terms and missions
Stone and colleagues [@stone_problem_2007-2] underline the importance of "opportunities to transform learner identities needed for zones of competency" as something that can and should be designed into inclusive learning environments (focusing on goal development). The work of 5D research in different settings further explores the process of supporting learner identies in context []  Gutierrez, Cole


#### 5. The introduction of maker types and side missions as affordances of my pedagogy to legitimise diversity

Such diversity in playtesting behaviours drove my reflection on the additional motivations bleeding into this system from other activity systems. Rather than refocusing participants back to more coding-focused activities, I coded playtesting and game making approaches in to a loose typology (see Appendix .makertypes for fuller detail).   

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game   
- **Planners:** like to study to build knowledge of the tools before they build up their game step-by-step following instructions
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users.

While not a conscious link, there is a parallel to the contrast between planners and bricoleurs present in this typology. By way of contrast the wider focus playtesting as well as coding behaviours.

Some approached objectives in a methodical manner, others socially and others embracing a playfully disruptive stance. Some decided to focus extensively on the creation and implementation of graphical assets and level design.

This process extends the work of Barron and Roque [@roque_family_2016; @roque_im_2016] to begin to surface and celebrage stylistic elements for all participants not just parents.

The process contextualises and legitimises the previously peripheral activities with the groups conceptions of the idioculture of the wider activity. This recognition of the hybridity of possible modes of participation increases conceptions of enacted diversity of the community. This strand of thought also invites a deeper theoretical examination of the value of identify formation.




<!-- Hence the next section. An attempt a synthesis of diverse pedagogical elements  - DOES IT? -->

#### 6. Synthesis, potential of explicit structuring of identity formation / spaces for blending of repertoires

QUICK LIMITATION / SCOPE
While I have an interest in future research in the specific social and cultural pedagogical techniques used in this study, in particular the use of side missions linked to participation types within a drama process (see appendix.MOE), such analysis has had to been de-prioritised from this research do to practicalities of space limitations. I have described a synthesis of these socio-cultural process in a book chapter as a framework called the 3M approach [@chesterman_game_2023] a summary of which is included in (see appendix.3M).



It is of value to examine specialisation as a form of agency and identity formation using different lenses.

It can be seen through the lens of double stimulation. The choice to specialise, marks a form of transformative agency. Participants craft for themselves a specialist status which becomes shared and celebrated by the group.

Thus transformation is happening here but not in a revolutionary way. It is more of a blend of practices. In my data this happens in vignette data we can see elements of personal interest of young people, of home education collaborative work patterns, and of practices introduced by the facilitator from professional and educational contexts.  



##### Examining complexity within identity formation and specialisation



Or, perhaps more accurately here as a movement between activity systems, to be incorporated as a repertoire.

These repertoires become public, and are in part socially motivated, via the process of playtesting.

The process of feedback, recognising and valuing the merging areas of specialisation and expertise helps the development of diverse practices [@digiacomo_relational_2016-1]. The specialisation contributes to possibilities of relational agency for the learning environment as a whole. It exists as a form of identity within an individuals repertoire and for others to draw on as an affordance of the learning system.

The awareness of and conversations about maker styles and related side-missions created in this research are potential powerful tool to support this process in novice game making communities.




##### Use of GDPs as a gateway framework to support the development of social and cultural repertoires of practice  

The examples of cultural uses of GDPs in the last chapter included for use in helping design for others, as a way of incorporating home funds of knowledge and to encourage the propagation of existing and emerging design elements and practices through the community.

I propose that providing a menu of GDPs can, as with accessing more abstract concepts, act as a gateway framework to facilitate to process of development of social and cultural repertoires of practice.

<!-- GDPs are used both as a useful tactic of navigation and as a bridging strategy to wider repertoires, then this can inform process of supporting the development participants to assemble their own repertoires of practice in this new setting. -->

The nature and process of this community evolution merits exploration. As such, this section steps back to discuss the emergence of these practices.

### Metaphors as a way to explore conceptions of agency within digital making

The previous sections have explored a complex and multi-faceted view of participant agency in this learning design. Before undertaking a fuller summary in the final section of this chapter, this section reinterprets some of these aspects using a metaphorical approach. The use of metaphor here has two functions. The first is to help deepen my analysis via a move to the abstract, searching for communicable generalisations. Secondly, given the multi-faceted nature of the pedagogy, and bearing in mind previous reflections on the value of an utopian approach to communicating the future possibilities of findings [@rajala_utopian_2023; @gutierrez2020utopian] paired with the conceptual difficulties of communicating complex pedagogical affordances of adaptable media-making toolsets (e.g., Logo and Microworlds [@kynigos_half-baked_2007; @kynigos_black-and-white_2004-1]), I draw on metaphors as a framing tool to present an initially simplified viewpoint for further discussion. The discussion will draw from these metaphors' relatable core principles to aid the accessibility of this research for an audience of practitioners as well as researchers.


<!-- In this case metaphors concerning learning spaces and movement between spaces are often found in existing research including: walled gardens, playgrounds, sandboxes, harbours. -->

<!-- **Complexity of the findings and emerging pedagogy** -->

<!-- Beyond practical aspects of dissemination, a further challenge associated with the overall goal of bringing a complex, flexible, learner-driven pedagogy to bear, is addressed by Kynigos , in articulating the limitation of uptake of ideas surrounding Microworlds. -->

<!-- There are a lot of moving parts in the final pedagogy and while I have put in work to address foundational aspects using relatable metaphors, the target audience in terms of coding enviroment designers, represents challenges in terms of complexity.   -->

<!-- I do brand it , and provide useful contributions in concrete instances of work -->


#### Harbours as both protective and authentic

The intrigue of opening up previously mysterious areas and seeing or experimenting with what makes them tick, often referred to as looking under the hood, applies here in the early stages of the learning experience. The process of clicking remix to fix a broken, half-baked game involves entering unfamiliar and potentially exciting waters. However, the motivational impact of an authentic process and set of tools must be balanced by possible accompanying complexity [@nachtigall_authenticity_2024].

Harbours are protective spaces suitable for docking ships. They may be natural or designed. If designed, protection is offered by artificially created harbour walls extending out into the sea, creating a sheltered space, preventing large waves from entering but also allowing movement out into the open sea. Harbours provide the possibility for refuelling or maintaining sea vessels and infrastructure to connect to rail or road links for transport inland. The term harbour is used metaphorically to indicate a space of safety, nurturing, and a gathering space f


<!-- SUMMARISE - MOVE EXTRA / EXAMPLES UP TO THE FIRST SECTION - FIND A GOOD PLACE FOR IT. -->


While this design uses an authentic, professional text-coding language with its inherent challenges, many other design decisions in this study were made to create a supported, simplified coding environment. Relevant examples from the previous chapter include: using an online code playground; shielding learners from the underlying configuration of interrelated web technologies; removing or obscuring structural code complexity in the code template.

<!--
My design decision to build the toolset as structure on top of authentic tools and languages can be likened to creating a protective harbour to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web-technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency. -->

The practice of starting from a template mirrors professional practice. The goal being to shield new users from the complexity of the underlying configuration of interrelated web technologies and instead highlight design affordances that facilitate creative agency. This strong alignment with authentic, professional practice may help learners transition from a supported harbour to venture out into the open seas of less supported research and practice.

An example of this being Toby and Dan in Vignette X. who, in their choice to change the game genre from platformer to maze game, leave the safety of a set of design patterns and paired support documentation. Instead, Toby must develop his code patching skills in choppier waters by accessing more authentic documentation and charting their own patterns in the open sea of internet-based resources. This is made possible by having an experienced navigator with him, in the form of a parent with relevant skills. I propose that the curated replication of authentic processes of finding and incorporating code snippets into the starting template supported the development of skills used in the authentic waters of professional coding communities.


In terms of agency and choice over learner pathway, we can see that the safe nature of the harbour encourages free exploration within its area. There are limits to the rhizomatic nature of this exploration. The boundaries of the harbour walls represent the restrictive decisions in terms of the genre of end product, and simplifications in code structures used. The following section explores the restrictions (e.g. in genre) from a perspective of the creative potential of such limitations [@rosso_creativity_2014].



<!-- This alignment with a rhizomatic approach within a structure has been explored in this thesis using a metaphor of a harbour in terms of the conceptualisation of the design from a facilitator / designers point of view. The habour walls represent the restrictive decisions in terms of the genre of end product, and simplifications in code structures participants must understand or create to make progress. -->

<!-- to other forms of web coding projects, due to the similarity of as this element of practice.

<!-- While it is important to acknowledge the danger that such support may make learners run into trouble if coding other projects outside of this supported space, the use of authentic code language makes this less of an issues than with specialised coding environments aimed at novices [@hagge_coding_2018]. Thus to make one addition to the metaphor this design is like a sea-harbour, tools like Scratch are like a swimming pool. -->



#### Spaces to play - playgrounds and jam sessions

<!-- The freedoms and restrictions of playgrounds -->

A similar metaphorical dimension of protection is present in metaphors of play spaces, a link which is immediately present in this design in the use of code playgrounds (web-based environments which reduce the complexity of web development and provide immediate feedback and community). Additionally, the process of checking the performance of games is called play-testing, with connotations of a playful, and therefore social space. Similarly, the term sandbox is used extensively in web development to indicate a safety in terms of non-critical space to trial new code and make mistakes. As with harbours, a space of play space evokes protection within designed limitations [@rosso_creativity_2014], but beyond that they provide affordances to encourage learners to evolve their own play processes as a form of transformational and relational agency. The concept of musical play within jam sessions is a productive way to explore this tension between freedom and structure.


In the previous chapter, I explored the flexible nature of emerging design behaviours and proposed them as a form of improvisation or jamming. Jamming, a term common in music and theatre, describes responsive, improvised, rapid and fluid responses to collaborators' ideas and audience reactions [@pinheiro2011creative; @sawyer_group_2003]. The area of improvisation is underexplored in the game jam context compared to that of music and theatre [@jaffurs_impact_2004-1; @merilainen_game_2020]. The following section makes a closer parallel in the context of the data of this study.

On a macro-level, at a jam event, infrastructure in terms of drums, microphones and amps are provided often by established regulars of the process. A jam on a micro-level is an introduced, familiar framework, restricted in that it is based on a familiar, popular song (often referred to as standards), within agreed genres (most often blues and jazz). The short structure of a song and the key in which it is performed form a base guiding improvisation. Within a jam process, bringing your own style to build on that structure is welcomed. The process is augmented by the group element of the musical jam, where music makers pick up techniques from others in the process. Visual and verbal encouragement is often present in successful jam nights to encourage newcomers. If a jam session is regular, local popular standard songs emerge. This provides opportunities to hear them played regularly, allows potential participants to hear them versioned before entering, a useful form of peripheral participation.


Several parallels to the design and processes in my research exist. The half-baked game template can be seen as a shared song framework that participants build on in idiosyncratic ways. The value of a process that incorporates an authentic audience made up partly of peer makers is important for the development of repertoires of practice in both contexts. The value of the possibility to blend established repertoires with those brought by new players is a shared contextual motivation.

Table 7.2 exploring valuable concepts via metaphor.



At this stage is relevant to return to issues of underlying  motivation driving participation as a way of making a link to existing research on digital making pedagogy. This metaphor serves to illustrate the importance of and possibilities for development of relational agency via participation in the joint process. Additionally, if relational agency is the goal and the means then building fluency of practice is an observable result of this process both in dimensions of technical fluency and in possibilities for expression. In the next section I explore a contribution to pedagogies developing technological or computational fluency [@resnick_coding_2020; @papert_technological_1995].




<!-- Some young participants became remarkably swift and adapt at thus transforming chains of actions into a fluid operation. -->

<!-- While the distributed nature of the toolset, hindered peer learning in P1 as too many tools were introduced, in P2 it helped build authentic digital literacy skills.  -->

 <!-- and the presence of affordances suggesting a particular form of action. For example a roundabout, or climbing frame in a playground invites a certain kind of interaction.

Thus in the design of this study

- template affordences,
- GDP menu as affordences

Other affordances of the design would encourage greater authorial (and relational agency), for example those designed to build user's sense of belonging in the game making community.

In this research, similar metaphors have emerged in the pedagogical and technical process surrounding the concept of playgrounds and gardens. In the previous section the use of a curated set of design patterns can be thought of as play areas or equipemtn inviting interaction.
 -->

<!-- **Games and play spaces**

These metaphors invite a connection to play theories concept of as the magic circle. Play theorist outline the value of stepping into a more controlled area of voluntary experimentation where the fear of failure is reduced. Game rules are norms which seed participation in community processes.

The concepts of affective space and magic circle  as a way to encourage participants to improvise from a starting structure are of value to provide guidance to practitioners in the domain of informal digital design.

The playful context of the game's magic circle can facilitate participants to adapt norms and rules to their own playing styles. Through this lens, the interaction of playtesting, code playgrounds and a sandbox of game patterns emerge as a key practices to facilitate and maintain learner agency. The discussion of the next chapter explores the intersection of these elements in more detail. -->

### Returning to gaps in the research landscape & my motivations

In Chapter x, I outlined in broad strokes areas of the landscape of computer game design and programming (CGD&P)

Overall, a gap in making games compared to playing them, a lack of those focusing on social and cultural aspects, and in particuar lack of specific pedagogies to address how to support these dimensions, in particular limited understanding on the formation of making identities.

In addition there is another gaps conceptually in a clarity in terms of what we are undertaking (CGD&P) for, i.e. the motivation, what we are developing.

While vague conceptions of collaboration and broader 21st C skills seem broadly applicable, they are unfocused.

While one promising concept, that of computational fluency, exists in broader research, the concept is only explored in broads strokes as both technical competency and an ability to for self-expression within digital code mediums [].

The work of Resnick is convincing but lacks theoretical foundations as Papert's ideas were before their time. It is of value to align them with more contemporary socio-cultural conceptions, in particular the lens of agency.


This research aims in part to explore to what extent my own interest in chaotic, community-based pedagogies aligns with those gaps.


### First area of contribution to the research in the field: An applied pedagogy with detailed analysis of inherent structural components

<!-- BRING IN A SUMMARY OF LEARNING FROM THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER ON GDPS. -->


This chapter contend that the underlying structure of the learning design is vital to support the social and cultural processes described above. This technical structure synthesises UMC pedagogy, a half-baked game template and the use of a collection of game design patterns. This section summaries this structural / technical approach.

In terms of the specificity of the last section, this chapter has, in line with underlying Marxist principles, returned to the concrete. Specifically the theoretical generalisation or germ cell that emerged from this research of the use of GDPs is applied in specific concrete instances in a variety of ways. The additional scaffolding provided by GDPs and the  synthesis of UMC and half-baked game, specifically as a boundary object with affordances inviting completion, contributing a more specific, accessible and coherent pedagogy to the the field of game making.

The scaffolding provided by the template and the close coupling of the purpose, description and implementation of each GDP accelerates and supports the making process which in turn allows for greater possibilities of social and cultural making via playtesting outlined in the following section. Thus the structural elements of this design facilitate the kind of relational pedagogies originally advocated by Papert and but which have too often been missing from research in this field.




<!-- The use of a menu / collection of resources can be considered an inclusive educational practice and offer a rich description of a concrete example which aims to align to inclusive, practice-based frameworks like UDL and PBL. While this may involve more work in advance, the benefits to inclusive practice merit it. -->


The potential of this innovation is significant in scope. Firstly, the surfacing of GDPs as a germ cell concept, facilitated the development of in different "stepped" progressively graded project briefs which build one upon the other as a flexible scaffold (HOW?), in a way which helps address the tension between freedom of choice of learner pathway, and expression of interest within a manageable technical structure (with relevant supporting documentation).


**Can't quite fit in.**

These varied forms of documentation, and their varied adoption and propagation represent different approaches to  scaffolding the process of becoming familiar with and then modifying to the code in often increasingly ambitious ways inline with the stages and ethos of a




### Second area of contribution to the research in the field:  A complex view of agency and repertoires development AND the value of that to contribute to research on DBR / FI etc.

<!-- - Addressing gaps in the research - The work of Resnick is convincing but lacks theoretical foundations as Papert's ideas were before their time. It is of value to align them with more contemporary socio-cultural conceptions, in particular the lens of agency.
- Also, as agency is seen beyond a individualised property, as participation in a community - as such computational fluency should also be challenged as a individualised approach.
- agency as choice over learner pathway potential is present in the potential of the menu of GDPs
- But beyond that simplistic element of choice, Development of relational agency is a part of the social and cultural aspects of repertoires development, which can be aided by the use of techniques like the explicit structuring of playtesting with side missions and implicit pedagogy of supporting maker types and parental helping roles.
- because of the DBR approach, agency here can be conceived  is ideally part of a utopian process, and thus as equity [Gutierrez], where there limitation in my approach, there are the essential conditions present. Thus it is transformational (which may not scale)
- More broadly this research can be developed beyond agency to encompass, equity, diversity, enacted, concrete, thus towards inclusion. -->


<!-- Given this challenge, the process of presenting the main elements of the learning design as a whole are challenging [@kynigos_half-baked_2007; @kynigos_black-and-white_2004-1], and bearing in mind that there are already a good degree of complexity in the pedagogy summarised above, it begs the question is it tactical to attempt such a synthesis in terms of the specifics of the learning design. -->





##### Returning to shifting forms of agency


REFRAME AS CONTRIBUTION
In this thesis I highlight the value of recognising the shifting nature of agency in this game making process, the value of designing for varied forms of agency, and  the use of metaphors to represent learning spaces and processes that foster agency in game making.

The following table is an illustrative chart using the data of this study.

| Instrumental Agency | Transformational Agency  | Relational Agency  |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Example one Vx etc.  | Example one Vx etc. | Example one Vx etc. |

Table. 7.x Examples of forms of agency in the research data

#### Summary of discussion on designing for agency

Agency in this in game making community is seen as multi-dimensional and as a process located in community participation rather than an individualised property.

A straight forward manifestation of agency stems from the importance of the collection of GDPS as a guiding activity. The  resulting choice over learner pathway helps transcend  limitations typical in instruction based approaches.

Beyond that element of choice, development of relational agency is a part of the social and cultural aspects of repertoires development, which can be aided by the use of techniques

As indicated above, I make no extra-ordinary claims concerning the processes used to achieve this goal in this design, those of  explicit structuring of playtesting with side missions and implicit pedagogy of supporting maker types and parental helping roles. My proposal is not that these particular techniques are particularly impactful, rather this is a potentially fruitful but under-researched area of design in this field and merits greater attention.  


**Agency / Equity Terms - utopian concepts**

The discussion above concerning shifting forms of agency can be developed further using the concepts from Gutierrez and Rogoff.

Given the mutuality of the DBR approach of the research process, and the development of relational equity in the process of specialisation [Gutierrez], the process aligns with a utopian approach to design research

Returning to the dilemma regarding the difficulty of maintaining a learning design requiring heroic levels of transformational agency, and the difficulty of replicating such conditions,

While there is clearly value in TADS as a concept in early stages of design, in particular as analytical tool, I lean more towards Gutiérrez's framing of equity and diversity in learning design overall as a goal to work towards.

More broadly this research can be developed beyond agency to encompass, equity, diversity, enacted, concrete, thus towards inclusion.


**Terms -  designing for agency means developing X.**

There is potentally a gap in communicating the value of this framing of the research to practitioners. In particular he framing of agency as a group process rather than an individual attribute could be confusing.

To follow on from the gap in research concerning the underlying goals of undertaking CGD&P. Let's turn to terminology.  

What goals in the field of CGD&P address the development of agency.

The concepts of computational fluency is can be critiqued as a potentially individualised approach compared to
Fluidity of practice of participants for characteristics of an emerging inclusive, idioculture

Learner agency in the form of choice over the  chosen activity is present not only in the dimensions of the difficulty and theme of the game features they wished to add, but also in their approach to undertaking it.

The conception of development of repertoires of practices is key to this interpretation.

As such, I draw on concrete example of repertoire in my research as a case study contribution to applied research in this promising field.


**equity and diversity as concrete instances with the learning environment**

Given the possibilities for participants, in particular children to develop specialism which allow them to share their expertise with adults, this invites further investigation of relational equity as a particular form of relational agency. This potential is explored in the conclusion.

#### Contribution to the research in the field:  The impact of the DBR / FI  


<!-- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10749039.2020.1806328#d1e455 -->



While the core theoretical framework of CHAT has been extremely useful in exposing important element of this research in flexible ways, this research raises important questions which are still in the process of being advanced in terms of suitable methodology.  Conceptions of both CHAT and DBR are still evolving. For example, AT proponents are advancing a 4th generation which responds to increasingly rapid and evolving situations [@engestrom_mediated_2021]. As a early career research and novice I cautiously advance some observations, at times framed as questions which may be fruitful in future interaction with DBR and FI research community.

1. How structural and permanent does transformational agency needs to be before it becomes transformational compared to a more blended view of emerging repertoires of practice?

2. What are the pros and cons of the use of 360 video to capture social / cultural interactions especially in this field.

3. The focus on broad affordances, and an expanded view of motivation and new emerging Zopeds - is needed for socio-cultural theory in this area. Hence the value of an experimental approach and the role of playtesting in advancing that process.

4. How best can socio-cultural approaches be aligned with constructionist legacy. Is my approach of x, fruitful in other areas?


TO INTEGRATE
The process of identifying and working with GDPs in this research process can be mapped as a dialectical process of moving (rising) to the concrete [@sannino_activity_2011]. It is this movement from a kernel idea into varied concrete instances that is the root of the power of the approach according to CHAT scholars.  While, the varied uses as meditational strategies and their integration into varied concrete forms of creative cultural and interpersonal repertoires many be particular to this setting, the germ cell concept described above is a theoretical and generalisable abstraction not particular to this context.

### On planned and emergent activity)

MOVE TO A DISCUSSION SECTION?
COMPRESS FOR INTRO?
THIS IS PART OF DBR - REFERENCE THAT IF IT IS STILL NEEDED FOR THE CHAPTER.



The previous chapters have described interventions in design that can be characterised on a spectrum between those planned and introduced by myself as a facilitator and those which were emergent, i.e. invented or adopted by participants as a response to the contradictions covered in chapter four.  

The distinction between planned and emergent activities became blurred as practices merged. In Chapter 6 outlines that while  I tool a lead to collate game design patterns into an organised collection with accompanying resources and a navigational menu, many of these patterns, were introduced  initially by participants who recognised them and wanted to add them to their own games.

This aligns with a key characteristic of formative intervention and DBR. Namely that elements of the introduced design changed responsive to learner need as the design evolved through iterations. Some introduced  processes outlined in this chapter were very minimal in embryonic form but extended significantly by participants.


AT theory emphasises that the process of activity does not start in a vacuum. This helps justify the formative intervention process which is active in intervention and in the initial shaping of activity. In an educational context, this can involve introduction of tasks as starting activities to shape. This is justified conceptually from a view of not restricting participant agency in that some form of activity should be suggested in order for them to make a rational choice as to weather to participate. It follows that this activity should encourage the communication that participant choice is significant in the design.

<!-- While, the personal expression via narrative and asset design can be engage and sustain the motivation of participants, these processes brought tensions identified in the _design chapter_ namely: (edit down into list? ) -->

<!-- **Exploring Tension - time spent on task - ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**
Take the example above, through use of pixel art editor, and template with small, retro themed graphics, as a designer, reduce the propensity to spend along time on asset creation as retro pixel art is quicker to make. -->

<!-- **Expectations- ALSO EXPLORED IN LAST CHAPTER**
- incorporating familiar or personally meaningful elements can involve challenges including that of unrealistic expectations based on previous game playing experiences -->






<!-- NOTE - NOTES ON THE CULTURE OF HARDNESSS - FIT IN SOMEWHERE IF APPROPRIATE

When explored from game making perspective the hard is good lens, is limiting in terms of building the engagement of players. However, culturally the desire to make games hard for other participants is more understandable in the context of retro games. .

- arcade games were designed to be hard to extract money from players
- nes games reputation for being brutal as they often had no way to save states, and much of the games challenge, due to limitations of number of levels or modes of playing, depended on this 'hardness'
- this developed later for snes games , finding challenge and other forms of ways of maintaining interest for different genres of games_
- retro games are associated therefore with being brutal and frustrating.
- thus in some ways the process of making a hard game is a way of getting your own back at all the games that have frustrated

### Building Identities as Game Makers  - EXTENDED

PARK THIS FOR NOW IN DESIGN CHAPER

COULD RETURN TO THIS IN A DISCUSSION CHAPTER - AS HAS IMPACT ON GDP TOO.

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with the positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you. -->

<!--
MOVE THIS SOMEHOW INTO A DISCUSSION AREA
#### Helpers supporting supportive community behaviours

While not a key part of this study, it is of value to briefly examine the role of student helpers in this phase.
One of their remits was to support the work of participants and to guide reflection by asking simple questions like "What have you been working on?", What are you working on now. What do you want to add to your game. Beyond this, students also gave feedback between playtestings sessions, connected different participants, supported parental behaviours,   into the design process via debriefing sessions. In journal notes I made observations and gathered feedback, while not fo extensively studied there is potential here.
Especialy in the potential to replicate family supportive behaviours with non-expert facilitators in a volunteering settings, specifically with bespoke guidance to support game making.

#### Code roles  and experimentation

While the parents are the ones doing the majority of the heavily lifting importing new code, children are observering and emulating this behaviour.

In one interaction child Ne visits the page to add a mechanic, starts to scan it, highlights some code, but then seems to change her mind
- perhaps recognising limits - or fearing the process of breaking her game - and returns to more familiar territory of changing game assets and level design.

- Glitch - 2019-05-08 - Te and Da  - create moving enemy but it totally leaves the screen. This caused amusement and participants knew how they thought they would follow that up.

 The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful. -->

 <!-- As mentioned in the previous sections, after analysis of this vignette in particular, it seemed promising to investigate behaviour and engagement at different stages of design process for this pair. To do this I have made extensive notes and used a coding structure for two complete sessions of this parent-child pair. The following observations have been made by comparing the codes on stages of design and types of participant interaction. This data was then triangulated participant feedback and my own journal notes. The observations are presented themed by the design stages used in the coding process with some general observations listed at the end of this section. -->

<!-- #### Discussion on design stages and GDP for this pair - DROP THIS?

 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.
 This parent was much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents. The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker/player type (concepts explored in previous chapter). This interpretation seems confirmed by less social interactions compared to may parents. The pair engaged far less in play testing of other games and peer support to overcome barriers. They also followed the stages of design more closely than may other groupings, an observation which is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

 This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." This alternation is driven or facilitated by the different stages of implementing GDPs. The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

 Using the coded data from nvivo to compare design cycle stages with pair collaboration, it can be observed that the most likely stages for pair collaboration were during the Ask/Imagine stage, Testing and Planning.

 The vignette shows evidence of that the actions of the parent to re-engage the child at different stages of the design cycle helped sustain the child's engagement in the more focused design process happening on the screen. However, an opposing pattern of behaviour may also be valid. When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups. Within Rogoff's model of community of learners [-@rogoff_developing_1994], this observation is viewed as valid form of participation. The child's ability to legitimately disengage from pair coding to observe the work and interactions of others in this emerging community of learners may also be sustaining.

 It is of note that when describing the design cycle for this family that this family along with others are working with decomposed smaller design challenges in the form of implementing GDPs. Thus the cycle is repeated for each new pattern that the pair take on. These smaller design iterations can be expressed within the framework of AT as an activity system. -->

 <!-- #### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

 NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION?
  NOTE - This more general observation may be part of the previous chapter

 We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

 - The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
 - This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

 Discussion

 - The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

 The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity. -->

<!-- This chapter has explored the affordances and potential of selected tools and processes in the context of in-person, family-based, game coding. As explored previously the literature on design for face-to-face communities which encourages community members to develop their own practices is sparse. -->

<!-- This section begins to explore observations in line with conceptions of authenticity and agency and other studies, identify processes to to aid researchers / practitioners replicate practice and understandings of the process. -->

<!-- I will extract observations from this research that extend beyond the process of coding into other domains.   -->

<!-- In this section analysis uses the language and concepts introduces in literature on affordances and transformational agency which in turn draws on concepts of conflicts in activity in activity theory. To help this process a quick recap of relevant concepts in relation to the contents of this chapter follows. -->

<!-- This study follows socio-cultural take that while objects have a forma of agency, affordances are not magic and become interesting to educators as part of activity stemming from human-initiated activity. -->



<!-- These include; authenticity of programming environment and language, use of the existing structure of the phaser library, the learning process of participants getting stuck and having to resolve tensions, my time limits providing individual support as a facilitator of a group, and the patience of participants when they encounter incomplete documentation. -->

<!-- While some areas of the design emerged in phase one, became a stable part of the design, (for example template and supporting documentation) other processes remained more flexible to interpretation and direction by participants; , playtesting, division of labour and use of home interests.   -->



<!-- #### Seeding community practices vs allowing open experimentation

While this has tricky implications for practitioners in more formal settings, there are tactics and tools which can help.  

DEVELOP THE ABOVE AS A SUMMARY OF THE PREVIOUS STAGES -->
<!-- The drama process aligns with particularly the use of a playful, fictional absent character called the Golem or Wizard that both young people and adults collude to keep real.  some of the aspects of the 5th Dimension project [@blunden2014seeking] [@blanton_effects_1997]   -->

<!-- The  marshalling towards certain goals to maintain a shared script / experience. -->

<!-- In Papert's [-@papert_gears_1980] study of his childhood play with gears he celebrated the joy of understanding processes hidden from others by taking apart and playing with technology.  -->




<!-- Because of the common use of design stages as a conceptual design tool.
And a prevalence of research linking design thinking  stages  and coding. I coded data to that. When coding data a design cycle framework was one of the code structures. Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share. However, when coding I quick became aware that naturalistic practice rarely matched the progression of the design cycle. The stages were instead fragmented and sometimes happened in parallel. -->


<!-- When designing program to prioritise learner engagement on to respond to their interests I found over structuring activity via design stages may be not be productive. The emerging process in this design related more closely to tinkering methodologies (previous explored). -->

<!-- However, while tinkering and improvisational approaches have been advocated in the domains of hands-on STEM exhibits in museums as part of the Maker movement, they have been less adopted in the domain of learning computer coding. -->

<!-- One side effect of coding by design cycle stage was to expose the limits of even an iterative cycle interpretation of the design process of these participants. -->
<!-- There is little data on the effectiveness of value even of explicitly teaching design thinking / engineering stages. -->
<!-- I did not give explicit facilitator input or guidance on the stages which may also have avoided norming participants towards such patterns. -->

<!-- Another cause for a less stuctured was the use of a templated game which contained andauthenticity which invited testing and sharing with after only quick changes. -->

<!-- I propose designing for more chaotic practices can increase agency as it reduces a feeling of prescription that may reduce a feeling of agency. -->

<!-- FIND MORE EVIDENCE FOR THIS. THIS IS LEARNER CHOICE OVER ACTIVITY / AND IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THINGS HAPPEN -->


<!-- While there is limited data as this was not a subject for participant interviews, and there is no comparative data here, this is an area that merits further investigation. There are parallels in existing research.
MOVE TO CONCLUSION THEN -->

<!-- While computer design stages taught using perspective stages approaches [Waterfall etc], there has been a more recent move towards agile, iterative approaches which allow for more flexible and responsive working processes. -->


<!-- In other areas of creative processes the concept of jamming is potentially useful as a grounding. -->



<!-- While design cycles was not an explicitly part of the game making instruction, certain interventions supported this approach. In particular the use of maps as a planning and reflection tool and the use of playtesting as a social and personal form of evaluation of emerging designs. -->
<!--
**Improving is Creating and Planning when remixing**

<!-- Implication one - When mapping the activity to a design cycle. There may not be neat matches and at some stage if the process is very fragmented the researcher or teacher can legitimately ask how valuable the design cycle is as a planning or analytical tool.

<!-- #### Designing to incorporate learner identity

NOTE - INCLUDE HOME ED CONTEXT TO AN EXTENT TO PRECEED LATER CAVEATS IN CONCLUSION

Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].

This chapter supports this research and also finds game making as  a suitable medium to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

Conceptually, within AT, these interventions and design choices which yield possibilities for self-exploration can be see as potential anchor points to increase learner agency.

In summary:

Family game making, of completing projects together with your parents or siblings has potential to remove the **I'm not that sort of person** barrier of cultural identity as participants are surrounded by their people.

  - the choice of retro games as a medium provokes sharing for older participants while their enduring popularity maintains common ground with younger participants;
- encouraing game playing and discuauthenticityssion of games helps surface positive affect and

The full process and rationale and initial reactions are detailed in appendix 4.x . In summary,

The process was very engaging, parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital identities of their children. As part of the process I then proposed that there different game maker types and asked participants to evaluate and discuss with peers what kind of game maker they were. From the following list.

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

### On Fluency

For example, creating a new graphical element in a separate online pixel-art editor called Piskel, exporting and downloading it to the laptop, and uploading it to the glitch code playground and then making code changes in several parts of the code to initialise and implement new behaviour for this element.

**A tension in use of norming practices and participant choice?**
However, as a seeming counterpoint to this growing agency is the norming effects of concepts that gain community currency in playtesting. The repeated attempts by participants to make the jumping mechanic of Molly less frustrating can be seen as a potential drag on the agency or autonomy of Molly as a designer. However this may be a false dichotomy. Such norming practices can be seen from a different perspective according to Rogoff, as a productive nudge to get real.

#### Community concepts and norming behaviour emerging during playtesting

MOVE BACK TO CHAPTER 6 IF SPACE?

NOTE THERE IS SOMETHING HERE ABOUT ME STEPPING BACK AND LETTING THE COMMUNITY EVOLVE.

Ed gives a more technical explanation from  involving the naming of the variable _jump speed_.

Other children come and play the game but only for less than a minute before leaving. Towards the end of the playtesting process, as one child leaves, Molly comments "It's so frustrating." This suggests an evolving understanding that her game is frustrating to players rather than pleasantly challenging.

The indirect norming behaviours described in appendix 5.Norm.x mirror observations seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues [@rogoff_cultural_2003] on learning in  community settings.

There is an apparent tension in play here between encouraging individual agency of expression within the game and an evolving community tendency to norm peoples games to be more _playable_, specifically that player movement should conforming to wider expectations.

What we can draw from the data at this stage is that playtesing provides many leverage points to facilitating learner agency and discuss the limits of designs. IN addition, playtesting is a process that allows participants to demonstrate informed criticality as a player and guide the creations of peers via gameplay feedback.

This process is an example of an emerging process where cultural concepts are mutually constituted by all actors involved in the game making activity system. While the concepts of hardness and challenge that emerge and not concrete examples of GDPS, they are the results of changed GDPs. The next chapter explores similar data on the use of GDP related concepts by participants and the resultant potential impact on participant agency.


<!-- #### Why prioritise local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community - and how are they different in character? PERHAPS DROP IF NOT NEEDED OR KEEP REALLY SHORT. AND MERGE UP.

While a lot of other research has focused on community as an online phenomenon, in this research that aspect has not been explored.

This section explores my decision to prioritise local playtesting rather than participation with a wider online community as well as  how are they different in character.

One reason was practical,  a suitable online community pitched at children or even at novices was not apparent using the chosen tools set.

The advantages of this decision is that interactions play out off the screen, the limited games available increase community interaction, as participants drew only from a small pool of locally created games.

While there is convincing research on on how online community  can engender feelings of agency and motivation [ROQUE AND ITO AND GEE], I chose not to connect with existing online communities in this learning design. Online communities can serve as a form of authentic feedback as explored in the Scratch and New Grounds community websites. However, the process of being involved in an online community and in addition learning the processes of participation diverts time and focus from other activities including real life playtesting.

In addition, the diversity of creations available on a online community may also have detracted from the more shared experience of the template used. Not offering a choice of starting game helped this shared technical and cultural base.      -->



####  MoE

One area of research which was explored in this learning design but which has needed to be deprioritise is that of Mantle of the Expert and the permission to play and experiment which the drama process advocates.

While a fuller exploration of how this was put into practice in P3 via a narrative which wrapped around the making activity, it is relevant to the use of side missions, and the possibility for character exploration in terms of a maker type.

#### **An example of mini TADS - use of secondary resources**
 <!-- REFLECTION ON BRICOLAGE? -->
An illustrative design tension emerged surrounding which kind of documentation to prioritise. After initially steering participants directly to code snippets, I subsequently directed them instead to step by step tutorials which also included a link to the code snippets. I shifted between prioritising instruction-based practices and more piecemeal, bricolage inspired (see LR) developer practices. Whilst the process of instruction is problematic in terms of learner agency this vies with the practicality to establish a common understanding and shared framework for production.

a theme explored in more detail in chapter five
Traditional, printed, instruction-based software manuals are in decline partly due online documentation but also due to the increased intuitive nature of their design [@pogue_user_2017].

vThe careful alignment between navigational documentation and the participants driving objectives of the mid-level activity system of implementing a game element, also helped avoid mismatch between task and tools described above as mismatch between primary and secondary stimuli.
The process aligns with the concept of just-in-time instruction.

**How broadly can the principles be applied?**

The general use of design patterns to guide digital creation are widely replicable, that of coupling documentation. The UMC methodology applies more broadly to design based education via prototyping. which could take other formats. Thus it is potentially applicable to other domains. And example of such is in PBL work using a campaign template and characteristics ads design patters, and a Poster, and elevator pitch feedback before creating then a stall [blog post].

<!-- This decreased need for secondary documentation minimises the possibility for task / tool mismatch.  As outlined above, to avoid the barriers experienced when searching authentic, developer-focused documentation and the support forums, I created  bespoke code examples in an online collection. -->
