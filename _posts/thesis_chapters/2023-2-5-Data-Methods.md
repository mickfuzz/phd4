### Culturally Inclusive Methods to Kick Start Game Making Communities (with agency in mind)

2022-08-11 - now thinking of putting this chapter first. Fits with narrative. And the progression from broader cultural factors, creating a coding culture, and linking to home interests / cultures.

Thus not dealing with the primary unit of activity yet, giving the cultural context. And exploring barriers to participation and efforts to overcome them.

## Scenarios - drama processes

### Vignette to start this section - something Cultural - Drama scenario - and response via interviews

<!-- Choices

- Something about aliens / feedback? Sub- Missions?
- perhaps a feedback session?
- Something about drawing on home interests.
- an example of playtesting?
- an overview of Mi's interactions on 2019-03-18 - home interests of art, community help, playtesting and being playtested, use of tools, Mi as a social coder compared to others.
- Or could look at the whole family unit mi, zi and ne - And their interactions with alien narrative. -->

<!-- Something like the social activity of Vignette Sh and Th - perhaps even that one - as it goes on to
describe the different kinds of interactions. But that is more interpersonal interactions for the most part.
Here we are looking at something cultural?? -->

Extract/s from Interview Ma  - A summary of the aliens / feedback - Missions ideally as a follow up.

## The impact of playing games and ongoing play-testing

<!-- NOTE - Include examples here which do not talk of GDP explicitly - but other cultural aspects. -->

For participants, playtesting provided a diversity of community-building behaviour.

Also noticeable is the variety of ways in which playtesting happens and how younger and older participants looked to give and take from the experience.

Older participants often used this as a way of being supportive to both parents and young people. This happened in the following ways:
- praising graphical content
- making links with home interests of participants and building rapport - ( e.g. do you like dogs? )

## The impact of remixing a half-baked game in a code playground  

**Tools: Specifics on Code Playgrounds and Phaser and a Javascript framework**

Make point that it is hard to separate out tools and communities. In case of Mozilla, code playgrounds, and teach the web, and the culture of developers and teaching communities they are interlinked.

Discuss and compare to Kafai in book, the lineage of Logo, Scratch.
Instead the more authentic approach of a real language.

The limits that this imposed and the development of a new technique of patching as a process, and the use of code frameworks. This you can argue is a much more authentic process which could get extended in other directions.

Bring out detail from the study to this section.

 - the media literacy practices of transfer between tools - similar to other studies - see guided participation papers

**Why Glitch and Code Playgrounds**

[THIS IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SO SHIFT TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER?]

An unusual approach so why?

- involvement with mozilla / teach the web
- authenticity - link between developer community and education, global in scope
- can use a cut and paste, remix, irreverant approach - link to media activist / hacktivist pirate cultures.

other unexpected Benefits

- could bring in other web creation resource, piskel,

Tensions compared to other more walled garden approaches - see below in tensions / move to make code.


### Documentation Types

#### Code Examples and Step By Step Tutorials

Towards the end of phase 1 I began to create code examples to illustrate of how particular commonly requested game features were implemented. These barebone game projects were hosted on a code playground. An online document in our shared google drive working space linked to these examples. I would help participants access this when they requested a certain feature. This list of game features began to grow. For phase one these code example were not particularly successful at increasing learner independence. There were differences in the code structure of their games and the examples and translation was not intuitive.

 In phase 2 I began to write up the implementation of the same game features but more closely integrated with the new starting code template used. Thus these individual tutorials became much directive. The step by step tutorials were available online and also as printed A4 hand outs which were provided on request of the older participants. I have brought the workshops resources together a book published on the FLOSS Manuals documentation platform Chesterman, 2019).

### Guided Code Patching

  In response to on-going frustrations of time blockages, where were commonly reflected back by participants, even after step-by-step tutorials were introduced, I added an additional layer of a more systematic structure to the existing resources. Visual aids guided where to cut and paste code patches within their code structure with a greater level of specificity see figure as an example. This addressed a common lack of detailed understanding of the underlying code structure used in the code and the importance to place code extracts in the correct function to maintain the integrity of the syntax.

  ![](./Pictures/10000000000003C00000021CF8C083766ADDCF9E.png){width="16.51cm" height="9.278cm"}

  In making decisions like the one to include extra visual scaffolding in step by step documentations. I am balancing here many different factors of concern in the complex learning environment. These include; authenticity of programming environment and language, use of the existing structure of the phaser library, the learning process of participants getting stuck and having to resolve tensions, my time limits providing individual support as a facilitator of a group, and the patience of participants when they encounter incomplete documentation.

  During this process of careful documentation I became concerned that over facilitation in this instructional way would remove the possibility for errors and thus reduce the opportunities for learning from resolving failure. However, while each stage of the process of adding game pattern was documented in as complete a fashion as possible, in practice mistakes were still made and additional customisations were made. Thus while the process did reduce dependency on my input as a facilitator there were still opportunities for me to support and resolve coding errors in person. When doing this I or other volunteers were able at times to give wider perspectives on the details of specific coding concepts and wider computational patterns. For example in terms of process, rather than writing code from first principles, this 'code patching' technique and subsequent debugging more closely represents the kinds of skills used by computer professionals on an everyday basis

### On Debugging and Embracing Different Types of Errors

 In the context surrounding the interaction outlined in the above vignette, the parent had tried valiantly to overcome a conflict caused by incomplete documentation and her own incomplete knowledge of the computational patterns used in the construction of the game's code. A way to start to normalise the experience of overcoming blocks is to get greater granularity on into the detail and types or errors. In the art of war on errors, we must know our enemy. These include:

 -   **Syntax and Program Errors** are errors in your code which stop the game from functioning at all, often resulting in a blank screen.
 -   **No Behaviour Bugs** are errors which in your code which don't stop the game from functioning but your intended effect is not present when it should be.
 -   **Glitches** don't stop your game from running but as you play you see that there is an unintended effect. The game does something different from what we want it to do.


#### Syntax and Program errors vs No Behaviour

Find examples.

Sh & Th for example gets so frustrated that keeps moving on to create compound errors.
One no behaviour bug can be worked around but a syntax bug stops everything.


#### Glitch Examples

Short examples of different types and the affect implications.

Glitch errors can be productive.

**Productive in exploring code / creating new game opportunites**
An interesting one where the x / y axis mix up for Te 2019-03-18 leads to a new challenge in the game.

**Productive in in**

- Glitch - 2019-05-08 - Te and Da  - create moving enemy but it totally leaves the screen. This caused amusement and participants knew how they thought they would follow that up.

 The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful.

#### Discussion on Errors

Further analysis of the different kinds of errors that are likely to arrive and testing different strategies for dealing with them that take into account the zone or proximal development of the participants may provide not only useful input for the participants, but also opportunities to check understandings of processes and game patterns and computational patterns in use.

Question - do more useful / less de-motivating errors result from remixing and game patching?

Perhaps see the above glitch examples. Not fully understanding every line of code can create a fun, unpredictable environment. We can infer from these examples that wrong behaviour may be easier to investigate and to correct than no-behaviour errors.

Aspects of the design encourage this kinds of error. Certainly the process of code patching does.


## Personal expression - Funds of Knowledge

### Building Identities as Game Makers

My journal notes see an evolution of attempts to try to build into the program, activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers or more generally digital designers. In and early tentative attempt to define in broad strokes the types of game maker behaviour and underlying goals. In doing this I have taken inspiration from Bartle's game player types Hamari and Tuunanen, 2014). I translated player types to maker types based on notes in my observation journal and extracts from screen capture data. The following list of *Game Maker *types:

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

For examples in the Vignette of S and T's interaction we can see attributes of the child as a Glitcher. In terms of understanding of the game as a dynamic system, this is seen clearly in the parent's alarm at the child's deletion of all elements of hazard. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. "It's no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid." The child seems determined to remove all hazards. My understanding is that she is also aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play. They seem to take pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context. The process mirrors play theory concept of playing against the game or dark play Sutton-smith, 2001).

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with the positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you.



### Circulation of peers and helpers & playtesting

This often facilitates talk aloud of design decisions and justifications.

### Accessing Help and Documentation

In the emerging community there was a variety of help available including;

- Written documentation from the learning design via step by step tutorials
- A series of code examples in working code playgrounds
- Facilitator help through asking for help
- Student Helper attention and help
- Peer support from parents and children

#### Tactical use of in-session support time

Parent Ma made a comment showing that he was aware of the particular value of the in-class sessions to overcome some kinds of blockages.

#### Accessing online, professional/community documentation

Te and Da - Accessing documentation Phaser

The process of modelling the specific practices of accessing developer documents and help forums is a form of apprenticeship and a direct sharing of a professional cultural practice.

Te takes a lead on looking for help on added a new GDP following enemies. He starts with menu, then book, then Da suggests googling and thus taking a step outside of the walled garden.

Discussion. There are pros and cons stepping outside that garden. Confusion, conflicts, complexity. etc. Vs. generating new patterns and personalisation of game content.
NOTE - THIS LINKS WITH DISCUSSION ON CHOICE OF DESIGN MORE GENERALLY.


#### Tactics in accessing help from peers and facilitators

A common teacher tactic is ask three then me.

The family group of Mi, Zi and Ne showed a lot of flexibility and tactical choices when trying to overcome blocks.

Zi more directly and loudly asking for help for faciliator often followed by comment from his mother to leave him alone.

in 2019-03-18 - 18.20 Mi's meets many small blocks and asks for help from a variety of people.
- Student helper to get online,
- Peer parent about use of piskel, and then her son
- Ne daughter
- Mick overall facilitator


#### Division of Labour - code patching and experimentation

While the parents are the ones doing the majority of the heavily lifting importing new code, children are observering and emulating this behaviour.

The documentation leads to a page with code examples.
In one interaction child Ne visits the page to add a mechanic, starts to scan it, highlights some code, but then seems to change her mind - perhaps recognising limits - or fearing the process of breaking her game - and returns to more familiar territory of changing game assets and level design.


## Discussion in Relation to Existing Research

Make links and try to develop knowledge inline with...

See summary at start of the chapter.




### GDPs and the sharing of personal experiences, identity and preferences  (cultural) -

In the previous example Ch was able to draw on his home knowledge of games and game culture. This section widens focus to also examine the intersection of GDP and of non-gaming experiences.

As we explored in the introduction and literature review, the ability to incorporate the following elements into created games and playful digital designs allows for personal expression in a way that can be engaging and sustain motivation [papert, roque, kafai etc];

- design graphics
- audio assets
- narrative elements
- physical computing

<!-- Recap from Lit Review / Intro -->

However these processes can expose and deepen key tensions identified in the _design chapter_ and in the literature review. Namely;

- time on asset design can detract from systemic and learning code concepts and syntax.
- incorporating familiar or personally meaningful elements can involve challenges including that of unrealistic expectations based on previous game playing experiences
- tension of a walled garden approach vs responding to freer design choices
- list others, draw on Roque, Kafai and Papert

This particularly salient to game making in a community context. As per work on Kafai and Roque who observe the following features of personal expression in a community game making setting.

- propagation of assets..
- pride sharing back?
- value of feedback, asset creation as a speciality

This section looks at the specifics of community aspects of personal expression in the data collected in this study, dealing specifically with narrative elements, and graphical and audio assets.

<!-- NOTE - CROSS OVER WITH PREVIOUS CHAPTER? PROBABLY DESIGN
(may need to move?)
Just create a summary here.

Existing research on digital making and creative coding has emphasised the role of personal expression to incentivise the creative process [Scratch roque community]. The creation of personally meaningful object to share with a community is a foundational concept in Papert's constructionism [CITE]. While the 3M design is more limited than a Scratch media project in the potential to incorporate home interests, participants did embrace existing immediately clear possibilities offered by the certain GDPs in the 3M starting design.
-->

<!-- NOTE - add into the design chapter - challenge of personal expression, incoroporating previous gaming interests and unrealistic expectations.
 -->

<!-- NOTE IS THE FOLLOWING ALSO FOR THE DESIGN CHAPTER?

Another opportunity involved choice and design of game assets that allowed the expression of identity or a designed element - for example graphics, audio or a written message to appear at various stages of the game.

The incorporation and design of game assets is taken as work on GDP for the purpose of this model.

The core GDP involving game assets already exist in the starting template.
- Objects as a reward to incentivise player exploration
- Objects as a hazard penalising player progress

The starting three assets, player, hazard and reward provide a scaffold to  guide  the choice of game possible themes.

The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game.
So while structured to avoid

 -->

#### Narratives and aesthetics of Games driven by Home Interests

- Interview data - Fi and Ma - talk of the way they incorporate interests of trains into the game.
<!--
also in [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;] -->

As part of the creative process participants were able to input their own preferences and interests. These commonly seemed to be driven by existing preferences and habits stemming from home life and other cultural sites.
Examples include participants choice of the theme of their game. Environmental aspects appeared to be something that many families could draw on from their home lives.

The design processes involved choice and design of game assets that allowed the expression of identity or a designed element - for example graphics, audio or a written message to appear at various stages of the game.

One pair Ch and Pa the grandparents of Te, included narrative text at the start of their game which explained their choice of graphical elements.

     var starttext = "This is a game which pits a honey bee
     against a swarm of Asian hornets,
     which are alien invaders attacking bee
     hives in the UK and which beekeepers
     are trying to stop spreading here.
     Try to guide the bee to collect all the
     flowers without being caught by the
     hornets.
     Use the arrow keys to move the bee.
              Press return to START.";


In a noteworthy exchange a young participant Zi asks one of the grandparents of child if they had done any amazing things in their life. This exchange follows

   zi: Have you done amazing things?

The exchange seems to throw Pa but they draw Zi's attention back to the game. Showing that it demonstrates their interest in bees as they are beekeepers.

The source of Pa's hesitancy to share more is not clear. However her willingness to share that part of her personal story via the narrative of the game is shown here as is the willingness of the young participant to ask about the personal experiences of the older participant during the process of peer testing her game.

Participants Ma and Fi designed one game around the characters of a train driver that needed to collect coal.


    Mick: (17-46) Can you tell me anytime that you felt like you bring your own identities or interests into what you were doing.
    Ma - Oh, definitely. Yeah.
    Mi: Let's ask Fi that as well.
    Ma: Yeah.
    Mi: Can you do feel like in making the games, you're able to bring your own interests or things that you related to into it?
    Fi: Yeah. The Fireman.
    Ma: Yeah, well, tell us about that game. Tell about your interests and stuff?
    FI: A little fireman, he's going around collecting coal for this train. They lost it. But then there's sheeps on the line.
    ....
    Ma: What is your aspiration for your life?
    Fi: I wanna be a fireman.
    Ma: On a...
    Fa: Train.
    Ma: Steam train.
    ...
    Fi: I really like trains, since like I was very, very young.

    Mick: Do you think I mean, was that was that like something that helps you a little bit keep your interests go in for the game?
    Ma: I think it excited you to have to build a fireman sprite? Is that right?
    Fi: Yeah?
    Ma: and to have it train themed, didn't that like, keep your interest in the designing part of it up? Is that true?
    Fi:  Yeah.
    Ma: Because the whole theme of it. Just I know just you're eyes lit up when you realised you could expand your interests into gaming.




In an interview exchange this pair
NOTE ADD IN EXCHANGE FROM INTERVIEW ABOUT INCOPORATING INTERESTS Fi and Ma

<!-- NOTE
NARRATIVE / drama IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER?
how do these two sections work together? remove this one?
 -->
While these pairs had the most clear links to home interests in terms of a guiding narrative of the game, other participants were able to bring personal expression to the process via game assets in other ways.



#### Visual asset creation and selection   

- Mi's interactions around graphics creation - write up transcript
- Mi's exploration in others.

There was a high degree of personal expression through interaction with the process of creating visual assets in particular.

NOTE THE NEXT SECTION IS QUITE GENERAL MOVE TO START OF THIS SECTION OR LIT REVIEW?
The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;]

In this exerpt parent Mi has spent

    St:  That's Good!
    Mi: Oh do you like it?
    St: Yeah
    Mi: Thank you. I'm very proud of it. Concentrated extremely hard. The thing is, you can get quite consumed doing things like this can't you?
    St: Yeah
    Mi: That's the problem at home I get a bit kind of lost. I can't get the knack of some things. It takes me so long to get it. I'm like  so excited.   
    - Both laugh.
    St: So are you going to do bits at home? When the kids are..
    Mi: I tried and I lost it all. And you know when you just completely... And even Ne didn't know so I just ... what a shame..  hours ....
    Laughs

    Mi - Lost time. Never mind.  We live and we learn.   

    Mi – We’re finished.

    Mi  - Right what’s next? Now I’m an expert pixel?
    Mi – Now I have to figure out how to get it in there don’t I? Without losing it I’ll be very upset.
    St – Have you saved it?
    Mi – No I’ve not saved it.
    St – Save there. (points to relevant button on screen)

We can see Mi cultivating a sense of ownership over the graphical element that she has created. There is also the development of a growing sense of competency in this area of asset design.


#### Other examples

**Repurposing graphical assets  in a playful way**

Pair Sh and Th used a graphic of a cute dog as the background of their game.  

- playing around the graphic - covering it over and revealing it

The child expressed a lot of positive regard to this dog and used it a way to stimulate conversation about their home interest in dogs during play testing.
- participant self-expression and a conversational prompt to other during sharing of the game

The subject was completely unrelated to the previously stated theme of the game.
It may be the parent knew this was a way to sustain involvement and interest.

These interactions re sometimes playful, and sometimes chance to share something serious. It allows young person to talk about dogs and their love of dogs. Even at one point that they used to have two and one died.

**Audio assets**
In the second iteration of glitch game club participants were introduced to tools to create sounds and a free audio resource repository. This allowed for rapid, broad strokes personal expression in a similar way to the use of graphical elements.
Examples? Ru and Ro ? in one of the later weeks?

### Discussion - on assets and participation

Cultural interactions seem to be able to motivate and sustain other interpersonal activity which may be experienced as work.
This is supported by other research on digital making and motivation. CITATION HERE? - or in cultural discussion?  

**Tangled nature of graphics and narrative in this design**
In the data analysed, young people


**Limitation of asset work as a GDP**
Note the limits of this interpretation.
While the reinterpretation of the MDA framework into a menu of GDP is practical for the elements that they want to change, it is not strictly a pattern to be implemented here.
A tension here to be briefly explored or noted to explore later.



## Design stages or flexible design practices

Surfacing maker types (as per player types) can encourage epistemological pluralism [Papert] or flexible design practices.



### Shifts in design practice

NOTE - Preceeding To follow shifts in perspectives bound up in designing for others, and the shift in layers of abstraction,

This section explores what other shifts in design practices



#### Alternating coding

Sh and Th
The parent cedes the keyboard and mouse and sometimes swaps chairs to allow child to play test the game created.

This follows a pattern of X   


#### **Shifting between Facilitator and more active partner**

At one point the testing process here is quite frustrating as gravity value is very low making any movement very slow with little control. While the child has previously rejected increasing the value, the parent's initial acceptance of this decision is later questioned. The parent who has to do the majority of the testing is more insistent to remove a frustrating part of the testing  process.  

Discussion drawing on more radical attempts to describe the best way to bring young learners into a design practice.
Perhaps in the field of participatory design.


#### **Rapid prototyping**

As per Te and Da - example in previous chapter where the preview window replaced paper prototyping, rapids shifts between code and game are optimal and build a particular fluidity of practice

- Well suited to build a repeated design practice.
- Especially with starting documents,
- Small changes had big effects.
- Variable changes needed immediate testing.  

While the design suits repeated design practice as illustrated by the example above, not all pairs or individuals interacted with GDP in such a neat way.

A later discussion section in this chapter illustrates a more complex interaction with design stages.



### Design (not GDP) supports Flexible Design Practices - Discussion? MOVE?

HOW EXACTLY? FOR NOW THIS SECTION IS A SUB SECTION MINI DISCUSSION.
HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO LATER DISCUSSION ON MINI JAMS ETC.
SHOULD THIS TALK OF DESIGNING FOR LEARNER AGENCY AND FOR DIFFERENT MAKING STYLES BE INCLUDED IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER  ON INTERVENTION METHODS?

Previously a broad range of observed design practices of participants which involve game design patterns were observed. The overall direction of the section is that it is beneficial to creative a community where there is a diversity of approaches being undertaken but with some underlying shared themes and practices.

Iterative agile design is a highly cultural / interpersonal process. (Glossary)

QUESTION - INCLUDE THIS OR NOT?
As discussed a in previous section design thinking education has created a set norms in communicating the stages of design that complexities are less readily communicated. On closer inspection, much literature on design processes contains caveats that some processes can happen in parallel and one stage may need several iterations. Given this caveat, I began to how useful is the overall in observing the emergence of complex creative processes.

To address this, this section looks as some of the emerging patterns which complexify the emerging norms of design thinking education.  *if that's useful that is - if not just describe complexities*

### NOTE - MOVED FROM ANALYSIS OF TH AND SH Vingette Describing design stages for this pair beyond this interaction

 <!-- NOTE - This section may move to a (previous) chapter (provisionally structured around inclusive methods) - of which overall interaction with design stages could be one aspect.
 As such observations are listed in bullet point in case a lot restructuring is needed. -->

 <!-- NOTE -  the chapter is moving towards GDP as main activity unit. or is this already addresAs sed in Methodology / Design
  -->

 <!-- As mentioned in the previous sections, after analysis of this vignette in particular, it seemed promising to investigate behaviour and engagement at different stages of design process for this pair. To do this I have made extensive notes and used a coding structure for two complete sessions of this parent-child pair. The following observations have been made by comparing the codes on stages of design and types of participant interaction. This data was then triangulated participant feedback and my own journal notes. The observations are presented themed by the design stages used in the coding process with some general observations listed at the end of this section. -->

 <!-- NOTE PERHAPS MOVE THE GENERAL OBSERVATIONS TO THE END OF THIS SECTION AS DISCUSSION OR SOME WHERE EVEN LATER. OR ANOTHER Chapter
 REWRITE TO KEEP FOCUSED ON DESIGN PATTERNS.

#### Discussion on design stages and GDP for this pair - DROP THIS?

 <!-- - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities. -->
 This parent was much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents. The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker/player type (concepts explored in previous chapter). This interpretation seems confirmed by less social interactions compared to may parents. The pair engaged far less in play testing of other games and peer support to overcome barriers. They also followed the stages of design more closely than may other groupings, an observation which is explored in more detail later in this chapter.

 This parent-child pair alternate between use of keyboard and mouse. The parent is keen to give the child hands on experience when possible, noting "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles." This alternation is driven or facilitated by the different stages of implementing GDPs. The parent may take the driving seat to overcome code blockages early in a create stage but yield to allow the child to input their design choices when more complicated work is complete.

 Using the coded data from nvivo to compare design cycle stages with pair collaboration, it can be observed that the most likely stages for pair collaboration were during the Ask/Imagine stage, Testing and Planning.

 The vignette shows evidence of that the actions of the parent to re-engage the child at different stages of the design cycle helped sustain the child's engagement in the more focused design process happening on the screen. However, an opposing pattern of behaviour may also be valid. When parent problem solving the child is sometimes physically inactive, looking into space, but then explores the space and/or engages in peripheral activity with other groups. Within Rogoff's model of community of learners [-@rogoff_developing_1994], this observation is viewed as valid form of participation. The child's ability to legitimately disengage from pair coding to observe the work and interactions of others in this emerging community of learners may also be sustaining.

 It is of note that when describing the design cycle for this family that this family along with others are working with decomposed smaller design challenges in the form of implementing GDPs. Thus the cycle is repeated for each new pattern that the pair take on. These smaller design iterations can be expressed within the framework of AT as an activity system.

 <!-- #### Comparing the activity patterns of this family to others

 NOTE - MOVE / REINTEGRATE? OR REWRITE AS A LINK TO THE NEXT SECTION?
  NOTE - This more general observation may be part of the previous chapter

 We can compare this pairs pattern of activity with other pairs / families.

 - The parent here is much more commonly rooted to the computer than other parents.
 - This meant they engaged far less in play testing of other games and found it harder to gain attention for direct support.
 - This grouping sometimes left early having completed more in code development than others but completed less social activities.

 Discussion

 - The parent had indicated that she considered herself a "planner" as a maker type  which is confirmed by less social Interactions

 The observations above show the importance of recording the whole room. Some participants will roam to observe the work of others, to socialise, to gain attention of others for support or for feedback. When analysing data using 360 recorded video side-by-side with the screen captured data, the participant can be followed around the room and their activity can be noted even when away from their activity. -->

#### The limits of design cycle stages

When coding data a design cycle framework was one of the code structures. REFER BACK TO ENGINEERING SOURCE.
Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share.

While design cycles was not an explicitly part of the game making instruction, certain interventions supported this approach. In particular the use of maps as a planning and reflection tool and the use of playtesting as a social and personal form of evaluation of emerging designs.

When coding I quick became aware of the limits and challenges to coding to this.

For example a lot of time in this informal game-making sessions were spent on activities outside of this cycle.
For example, opening up the right tools, navigating to correct locations and finding past assets involved a fair deal of effort and collaboration.

I have been pragmatic and map elements like this these loosely. Where appropriate I make notes on that activity in free form areas of other documents like spreadsheets.

This limits claims I can make from the coded data. However it raises interesting points which merit discussion.

#### Value Faff Time.
So much of the creative process is faffing. More precisely many creative moments happen in times not neatly represented in the cycle.
For example the navigation to the right location in creative software, finding assets, migrating assets between authoring tools, converting to correct formats, evaluating new tools.

This is something that I do not have a precise name for. I call it digital laundry or digital housekeeping. Things that at times can be low attention span or which can be extremely frustrating like needing to tidy up so you can find your car keys.
There is frustration here, but there are also moments of creativity, and there are bonding moments which are undirected activity but shared.  
For example.....

#### Improving is Creating and Planning when remixing

For example when altering jump and move variable for the first time. They are deliberately set low. Thus while technically this is improving the code. As the participant is meeting those variable for the first time we can recategorise in the create category.

CASE - One parent did extensive design and then altered the variables at the end. Mi -

<!-- Exerpt Mi - 2019-03-08 - 52 mins -->

#### Digital Jamming

This has an example in the use of sound making software Fi & Ma -
The process of tinkering and messing spurs creativity that doesn't map to a design cycle.

They are in an evaluation of tools which could be said to be in planning stage,
However this quickly become creation as they decide the spontaneously created music is preferable to the one created using a different tool at home.

The joint jamming then has created two different soundtracks. This sparks a new thought to create different soundtracks for different levels.
This would fit within the Imagine stage.
Plan then Create then Imagine then Revise all in the space of a minute.

Implication one - When mapping the activity to a design cycle. There may not be neat matches and at some stage if the process is very fragmented the researcher or teacher can legitimately ask how valuable the design cycle is as a planning or analytical tool. Other less formulaic theoretical perspectives on creative processes exist including rhizomatic approaches [@de_freitas_classroom_2012]. And some attempts have been made to incorporate design thinking with a rhizomatic approach [@biffi_chasing_2017-1].

Implication two -when designing a program and thinking of how to present the process to participants, over structuring around a design cycle approach may be not be productive or accurate.
Question? How does this relate to tinkering methodology?
What other framework would be suitable here?


#### Discussion - encouraging improvisation in the design process.

<!-- Pumping up the Jam - -->

In many interactions we see improvisational approaches.

Example from Te and Da - 2019-05-08 -

    Da- use paper to design
    Te - I'm just going with it

The tools, process and the community encourage a jam / improvisational approach. Remixing, chipping away, a shattering of design cycles. More of an informal approach

The concept of Jam is explored in rapid, improvisational events called Game Jams.

Some of the following sections discuss design factors and participant responses which fit this category of informal creative practices.
player types


#### Example: Fluidity of design practice

Another example shows an evolving fluidity in response. Ch incorporates a boost to player health after a level after being given feedback during playtesting.

Other participants also demonstrate fluidity of response although to a less sophisticated degree. The process of altering design especially suits a fluid response as makers build their design skills by rapidly altering  

This is participatory appropriation in that it is a new GDP that stems from original thinking on the part of the participant.  


## Community Aspects of the 3M design

When reviewing video data. There are lots of interactions, peer and pair, that are influenced by the community focus of the learning design.

A bullet point summary follows

- helpers circulating (2019-03-18-te for example )-  playtesting as a community activity and feedback.
- getting help from all sources possible


## Discussion - Overcoming Tensions and Blockages related to Culture and Affect

A tension outlined in the literature are barriers to coding and complex digital practice. A common perspective being I can be paraphrased as *I'm not that sort of person *(explored in lit review). My starting thoughts for this program to address this barrier included the following perspectives:

-   The premise of family game making, of completing projects together with your parents or siblings has potential to remove the *I'm not that sort of person *barrier of cultural identity as participants are surrounded by their people. -   In a large majority of cases game playing has high exposure for parents and grand-parents (either directly or through other family members). The choice of retro (arcade / first generation) games as a medium maximises this familiarity. -   The choice of toolsets to allow participants to bring their own family interests and explore issues being discussed in the home life helps participants to draw on home funds of knowledge and discourse while learning unfamiliar processes Moll et al., 1992). -   The use of regular physical / drama games and physical making activities may reduce anxiety associated with new language acquisition Krashen, 1982) (in this case the technical terminology).

Some of these observations and starting points were the continuation of my own work as a facilitator of open making focused training sessions. Especially the use of fun, communicative drama games to create a playful atmosphere for learning. An observation from my journal during phase one of the program underscored the importance of this starting points. The value of playfulness is illustrated with one exit interview with a parent where they shared their reasons for leaving the program. At one stage after a week where they had missed a session, their family looked around and saw other groups involved in 'hardcore coding' and no longer felt at home. They compared this previous sessions which had more fun and group oriented activity.

I was struck that his incident happened during a session where I had not played customary drama games to create an inclusive environment. The games had been omitted as I was responding to a sense of urgency coming from families to solve problems. The scarcity in facilitator time drove me to crack on supporting families to debug code errors. The incident lead me to greater reflection on ongoing measures needed to prevent participant drop out for due to cultural tensions and negative affect to the working community. These include:

-   An awareness of the danger that those more confident in coding create more involved code problems that need more facilitator time, potentially making others feel less valued. -   A concern for the fragility of learners positive affect towards the group game making process and thus the need for initial playful starting and closing activities to be continued beyond initial sessions. -   The value of a stronger buy-in by participants, ideally a greater commitment to the collective making process balanced with the need for low pressure (avoiding a negative sense of obligation).

These observations were in part resolved by previously discussed issues including the more egalitarian and accessible pathways to making resources and navigating their learning. I also adapted my sessions to ensure a consistency of non-digital and playful activities. The challenges of helping participants increase their confidence and commitment in program participation are explored in the the following descriptions detailing specific activities which were added to the program.
