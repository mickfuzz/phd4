## Personal context

In the middle of regenerated Hulme on the corner opposite the Birley fields campus is a squat unassuming building called the church of the Ascension. A part from being  a site of sanctuary for the political refugee Virag Mendes in a notable anti-deportation campaign of the 1980s, it was also the site of one of Europe's first electronic village halls. In 1996, as an unemployed recent graduate and new editor of a fanzine on the fledling electronic music scene centred around the Hulme venues of the Nia centre and New Adri, I was directed to this centre as it had the software Abiword which had the ability to print out rounded text boxes, a feature I thought would look pretty snazzy cut and pasted over over-photocopied backgrounds from 2000AD. No physical place in the UK seemed to better live out the counter-cultural, dystopian, cyberpunk ethic popularised by 2000AD and the author William Gibson. At the Hulme Community Computing Centre the hippy volunteer who facilitated my fanzine printing encouraged me to make a website of the fanzine. On later visits he gave me a print out of a website that detailed how to write HTML web pages and offered free webspace as part of the HCCC site. Pete was enthusiastic about the Unix operating system common mostly on web servers and university computers.

This spirit of peer-learning combined with my desire to share the ethos of the DIY music scene fuelled many years of using the internet to promote unlicensed music events. In 1995 and 1996, the internet, like Hulme, seemed to be a corporate free space, a space for oddballs, niche enthusiasts and more importantly activists. This period saw increasing alignment with the growth of the internet to link up activities of disparate political and cultural groups around gatherings international finance institution (IFIs). For me this culminated in helping to organise and promote an event for June 18th 1999. Similar carnival-themed events drew on the blue print of reclaim the streets mixing street blockaded by outdoor sound systems. While the site of street party and protests as a chaotic and inspirational environment has been explored [@carmo_reclaim_2012; @jordan_notes_2005].

I have been inspired by the possibilities of the party and protest movement as an inspirational site of learning. My involvement with the movement led me to help develop my internet publishing skills aligning myself with a broad network of media and internet activists centred around the Indymedia project. On a personal level, my development as a media activist including but not limited to: graphic design; web page creation; computer programming; video editing; audio-visual events tech; and server maintenance was driven with motivation and support provided by people involved in that scene.

<!-- In 2001 later after working as a teacher, and being immersed in the party and protest scene I returned to Manchester and found a home in the Redbricks estate. Since 1999 local residents had rented a pre broadband T2 internet collection and used linux servers and snaking, self-made  network cables across roads, through roof spaces, to share this connection for affordable prices. Pete helped set up our connection for a home office for a new internet project called Beyond TV which was a pre-YouTube internet sharing site off shoot of the Undercurrent VHS magasine video activist project [^4].   -->

The empowerment and education aspect of these networks and new uses of technology was something that I wanted to share with wider networks. To pay the bills I developed a specialism in  internet and media creation training and community as paid activity to support my environmental and migrant activism. One role was as a documentation writer for Floss manuals specialising in free and open sources tools for media and secure communications. Another of those roles was to set up run a media centres for an activist social centre, Community Arts Northwest and People's Voice Media.

As time developed, my activist activities aligned with arts techniques, integrating performance art and activist outreach particularly at film screenings. I enjoyed being part of a wide network of activist embracing playful, performance based actions and activism [@klepto_making_2004; @routledge_sensuous_2012].   

Unfortunately, the performative element of activism took a dark turn as when it was revealed that the activist network I had been involved with were heavily infiltrated by police. Police infiltrators had also been undertaking a performance. The reality that the police and wider authorities had just been letting direct actions happen and even instigating some of them was stark.  While I had always been aware of the limits of our agency, I was still not ready for the reveal. The process of being secretive about our actions and my role in outreach for this movement became very uncomfortable.  The movement felt unsafe for myself and for others.   

The intervention of environmental direct action had clashed against the interests of the state. It had become clear that while bother sides were prepared to bend or break the rules our side was much less prepared in terms of legal and financial back up.

After writing the first draft of this personal history, it seemed quite depressing. The ongoing revelations of the extent of the police infiltration of activist networks[^1], and the use of personal and sexual relationships to further this disruption to the groups[^2], took a heavy toll on my mental health and my world outlook. My work with social movements to take advantages of new opportunities created in part by community-driven technology to cause societal change had been met with a response from forces that were far better resources than we were. The push back from state and corporate bodies had used a diversity of means at their disposal: some legislative and bureaucratic; some underhand — notably the embrace, extend & extinguish [^3] tactic to counter to open source successes —; and some illegal means.


<!-- Project-based community and communications felt rewarding but the legs of community-based adult education were being cut off by the coalition government. -->

### A response of sorts

My response was to shift focus on community work and training and documentation work with international networks and then eventually to informal learning of media creation with young people and families. While this move was a retreat from other domains in part driven by painful experiences outlined above, my shift of interest towards young people and family was a positive and strategic shift to align with my new role as a university tutor in education and as a new parent.

There are positive elements to this otherwise sad story. My experiences have helped focus my interests on how change can happen and happen quickly when new opportunities become available to a community eager to use them. They also caution against unrealistic expectations of systemic change when faced with opponents with deep pockets and extensive resources. I would like to communicate a pragmatic approach of finding the limits of your agency, strategically pushing against them, and cautiously observing what happens. An informed activism built on a critical view of the nature of the system in question.

My work in for FLOSS Manuals allowed me access to diverse international networks. These seemed one step away from grass roots organising  on the frontline but still informed by participatory and egalitarian methods. These networks included those advocating for Open Web and Free Culture, promoting Open Video and Video for Change movements. One thread of this work led me to work in partnership work with Mozilla and to gain awareness of the Webmaker education programme. Webmaker was more than a set of tools, Mozilla created workshops guides and in partnership with networks of informal educators in the US like Mouse, Hive Neworks and The New Youth City Learning Network. The motivation was to involve teens in being web literate through making web products inspired in part by Douglas Rushkoff's call for everyone to know at least a little bit of coding [@rushkoff_program_2010].

    And as we move into an increasingly digital reality, we must learn not just how to use programs but how to make them. In the emerging highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either create the software or you will be the software. It's really that simple: Program, or be programmed. [@rushkoff_program_2010].

This avenue offered a positive way to discuss the politics of independent communications and an empowerment agenda. The development of javascript based libraries like Popcorn.js also exposed the limits of my self-directed computing skills.
Thus it was strategic to I retrained with a masters in Computing and then a PGCE in Computing at Manchester Met. The rhetoric accompanying the launch of a new curriculum promised the ability to undertake game and media project production as a way to increase learners authentic real-world programming skills through creating authentic projects [@livingstone2010next].

During my PGCE year I found it challenging to bring in the kind of project based learning techniques to the classroom, a theme explored in this thesis. I did however manage to create a pilot scheme to teach javascript in playful ways, using Mozilla's webmaker tools and ethos, which I trialled in the classroom and wrote up as a dissertation and published the results as an addition to the Mozilla's online teaching resources.

The turn to games began in my new role  Manchester Met Uni role doing community partnerships, in a consultation with home educators partnership work. To align with the interests of parents and children at the consultation asked if we could lead activities which drew on interest in games like Minecraft to start to do computer coding.

The shift from making web-based media to games made sense given the patch success I had had with web coding pages with school children. Rather than using media to mobilise and feed into social movements, games became a medium to explore and create as a playful educational experience. Both were grounded in self-expression, participatory culture and I was to find out both could use similar technology. To inform this work I returned to Mozilla's web developer resources to discover two step-by-step tutorials outlining how to game making in the browser using a javascript library called Phaser. I was able to combine my work using the code playground Thimble with the js library Phaser to create an potentially accessible toolset for young learners.

My study, in part, explores ways in which how the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities can be brought into more structured educational environments.   


## Learning game making using text coding languages

### The context of retro gaming

One of the reasons that I was interested to shift to game making was the potential that seemed to be present for intergenerational work based around retro gaming based on its place in public memory [@heineman_public_nodate]. The place in public memory of retro games is complex but for older participants, the effect of nostalgia is significant.

What era and technologies constitute retro games can be disputed, however for this study I use a definition of early arcade games from the 1970s and early 1980s and early generation of home consoles Atari 2600, Nes, Snes and Megadrive before the advent of 3D graphics.

Retro games have a particular aesthetic driven by graphical limitations and the simplified game mechanics which are
due to the limited capabilities of the hardware and storage space involved. These limits suit the capabilities of the chosen design tool Phaser.js.


### Motivations for learning to code specifically via game making

Broadly game making and creative coding can he

- for intrinsic pleasure of making games or other products
- for commercial purposes to join games industry
- STEM pipeline in more general terms
- for empowerment of individual and health of society

### Context of game making for educational purposes


The potential of digital game making is explored in depth in a review by Kafai and Burke [-@kafai_constructionist_2015]. The most prominent learning objective of making games in educational setting is to develop _coding and computing skills_. There are extensive studies on _game making to learn other subjects_ including maths, biology and chemistry but diverse examples exist. Game making can also develop social skills, self-reflection, cultural awareness and a range of technical abilities that allow participation in information society. Finally, because, game making involves a systems-based understanding of the world, and as games are themselves interactive systems, they are a powerful vehicle for exploring complex problems involving race, sex, social issues [@tekinbas_quest_2010].

While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research. New software tools to make games which offer new pedagogical possibilities emerge regularly. Game playing practices and the opportunities provided by participation in wider communities also continue to evolve. For example, casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014].

### Computing as a School Subject in the UK

The influential report "Next Gen: Transforming the UK into the world’s leading talent hub for the video games and visual effects industries" was focused on providing the UK games and animation industry with the talent needed to succeed [@livingstone_next_2011]. The top recommendations were to include computer science in core curriculum, introduce a new Computing GCSE (a general exam for 16 year olds before they progress to more specialised study) exam, offer bursaries for computing teachers and to implement well-supported use of games and visual animation in the school curriculum as a way to attract more young people to the subject.

The After the Reboot report [@waite_pedagogy_2017], returned to the subject of game making as a way of increasing engagement in the process of coding. The review highlighted several areas of promise which needed more research: using games for engagement, use of design patterns - a term explored later in this chapter - and the involvement of girls in coding and social and cultural aspects of coding. The "After the Reboot" report also contained concerning observations. The report found that girls, ethnic minorities, and students of lower socio-economic status were all less likely to take computing as a subject at GCSE level. Game making aligns well with the principles of inclusive practices and project-based learning (PBL). It provides: learner choice in projects which increases motivation; authentic and shareable project outcomes to encourage peer feedback and reflection;  iterative projects work supporting student mastery; and challenging goals and guidance in goal setting aiding self-regulation in learners.


<!-- The benefits of game making aligns with those of wider creative computing projects. There has been extensive publication on computing education and techniques aimed to support teachers often new to the subject. These include a new website with materials, including quick guides and writing around a set of 12 computing principles.
A lot of this literature is aimed at helping teachers in a classroom context and with a focus of explaining and exploring computing context.
MORE ON THIS - OTHER TIPS FROM NCCE AND LINKS TO RESOURCES.
BUT NOT TOO MUCH
While projects are mentioned as a principle that allows learners to deepen their understanding on computing concepts by putting them into practice. There is less on specifics of how teachers can support project work or indeed how to best develop resources to support project work in schools. -->

### Empowerment agenda of authentic computing aligning with personal motivations

Fluency with the focus on personal expression aligns with motivation of empowerment and equality of access not only to future employment but a broader participation on a digital society.

This agenda has parallels with other domains of participatory culture that I have been involved in.

- DIY music and protest event organisation
- Participatory media making for social and environmental causes
- Documentation writing using collaborative processes
- Creative coding

In summary, as a Computer teacher candidate I was drawn to the possibilities offered by a new technologies and the shifts in computer pedagogy. In the reality of schools that I taught in working within the constraints of the curriculum, exams and competing pressures for time worked together to prevent the kind of authentic activities that first attracted me.

However, a new position as a project work for EdLab allowed me the ability to explore this outside of the classroom in more innovative programs and partnerships.

- Hive Manchester and Code Club
- Coder Dojo
- Creative coding at Manchester Libraries
- Speciality training for PGCE and Primary Education programmes
- Home education workshop in Manchester Met in partnership with students as part of Edlab and other PBL courses.

#### Authenticity as Empowering

Later in this thesis I problematise the use of the work authentic in learning [@lee_none_2016]. In this introduction I refer making games that will be played by audience of friends and family and using tools used beyond the scope of education, professional communities.  

I was attracted and received positive feedback from the process of lifting the lid on the specifics of authentic tools computing. The tools created by Mozilla to investigate and to remix HTML pages scaffolded the experiences of new learners and paralleled  my own early experiences of self-expression through hacking a new technology.

In additions, the practices of code patching and remixing are authentic skills used by professional coders who find and combine existing code libraries rather than coding everything from scratch.

My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics and Scratch.

FIND SUPPORT FROM MOZILLA WHITE PAPER - JUSTIFY EFFORT OF JS AS A STARTING LANGUAGE

In additions the process of making a game for peers is authentic for young people.

Aligning with the activities of Nicola Whitton exploring the rules and components of games in a playful way.

Javascript is an authentic language, core the web. Phaser is a professional and enthusiast framework. Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals.

In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity and thus an ability.


### Game Making, Project Based Learning and Inclusion

Contemporary understandings of inclusion go beyond SEND (special educational needs and disabilities) issues to include cultural exclusion which may include dimensions of race, gender or other cultural factors. Recent studies study the use of games and playful techniques to overcome exclusion from the culture of computing [@kafai_diversifying_2017; @kafai_beyond_2014]. If students feel excluded from school culture then making bridges to home cultures is vital. One way to make those connections to home cultures is to allow for more choice of what can be incorporated into computing projects. The benefits of game making as a form of project-based learning (PBL) also align with a teaching framework focused on inclusion called Universal Design for Learning (UDL)[@basham_understanding_2013]. While an analysis of the synergies between PBL and UDL is beyond the remit of this chapter, key characteristics of game making as an educational activity align well with both UDL and project-based approaches. The following sections give three examples.


The term inclusion in education no longer addresses solely children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) but also examines barriers of culture and other exclusionary elements of the school environment and discourse [@black-hawkins_achievement_2008]. The issue of alienation from the culture of computing in schools has been identified as an issue of concern especially for girls and some ethnic minorities [@the_royal_society_after_2017]. To be inclusive schools and teachers must identify both traditional SEND issues and wider cultural barriers to participation in computing classrooms and help student overcome them. Beyond the important technical accessibility tools and assistive learning technologies - for example text in different sizes, screen readers - a diversity for inclusive teaching strategies are also needed.


<!-- The next section deals with inclusive
Web-based or software activities include game making, meme creation, hobby website creation or making storytelling adventures. Incorporating materials from narrative forms like books, films, games and social media content into computing projects increases the ability for learners to bring their own interests into the mix. However, while the range of materials and possible creative projects is exciting and full for promise for computing teachers, it is not always clear how to best approach these opportunities from an educational point of view. This chapter will explore teaching and learning approaches to increase learner engagement with computing, firstly by defining and exploring concrete approaches, and then by sharing useful classroom tactics.
 pedagogy but Florian and BH make a distinction with other similar terms does this need to be explored?  -->

<!-- Researchers Black-Hawkins and Florian [-@black-hawkins_classroom_2012] note that many teachers report lacking the knowledge to effectively teach children with SEND issues.  -->

One way to address SEND issues is to use differentiation to adapt a the standard lesson plan for learners needing special support. However this view of a standard, optimal learner pathway is not supported by recent research in neurodiversity, which suggests there is no one optimal way for students to learn. Inclusive pedagogies take a different approach to differentiation which places more power in the hands of learners to choose the path that is most appropriate for them. All students are given a greater choice of materials and activities from the start suiting the varied needs of all students. This has the benefit of removing stigmatisation of some learners having to undertake work that seen to be created for _low-achieving_ students. These principles - among others - are presented in a framework called Universal Design for Learning (UDL).


Rather than designing separate activities and support for learners with different educational needs in the classroom - often labelled accommodations for disability - UDL facilitates learners to choose a learning pathway that suits their individual abilities and learning strategies.

UDL places great value on the personal relevance, choice and authenticity of learning experiences. As a way to encourage engagement UDL suggests setting choices of concrete learning goals that are relevant to the learners. This learner-led approach is very different to a traditional-instruction based, directive approach to teaching. The diverse learning pathways offered can be unfamiliar for both teachers and for students. The UDL guidelines recognise this and provide information to support teachers to implement them. As educators, we may need to build our own abilities and familiarity with learner-led approaches as well as growing the autonomy of our students.  

<!-- Students can then be supported in the discovery and recording of the underlying concepts after undertaking activities. -->
<!-- ### Case Study - Exploring Universal Design for Learning in Context -->
One area of UDL that teachers can implement straightforwardly is to represent concepts in the classroom in a diversity of ways. In a related study, researchers Cook and colleagues [@cook_using_2016] explored the alignment of UDL with another framework, CRA, which consists of a three stage model to support learners to develop concepts [@fyfe_concreteness_2014].


The researchers outline how the three stages of CRA (Concrete, Representational and Abstract) align with key UDL principles, most specifically multiple ways to represent knowledge to aid learner perception and comprehension. In short, first teachers introduce a physical, concrete model of the concept, then progress to iconic forms, for example graphics or pictures; finally learners work with more abstract models of the concept. The CRA framework is an example of concept popular in Mathematics research and practice called Concreteness Fading where concepts are introduced in concrete examples and then learners are supported to understand and represent them in more abstract ways.

When reading about different approaches to teaching computing the terms concrete and abstract are used commonly. For example the concrete practice of coding is a good way for learners to work with more abstract computing concepts. The following section explores the utility of these terms to explore inclusive approaches to teaching especially in relation to an understanding of Computational Thinking.

### Context of digital making and design and home learning of media

The context of these communities is important to situate the relevance of this study. These contexts are explored in summary. In the following chapter some of the pedagogies, e.g. tinkering, are explored in more depth.


Building on the concept of participatory culture [@jenkins_confronting_2009], where x and y, there are several streams of activity that are important to reference as foundational context for this study.

The work of Livingstone is foundational in the area of home learning of digital technologies[@livingstone_digital_2018].

Research exploring home game playing and digital activity uncovers material that families may bring into a non-formal game making process.

Messing around and affinity groups. Ito's work on  and naturalistic studies of digital use and creativity in the home including the value of informal playing around [@ito_connected_2013-1; @ito_hanging_2010], and Gee and the process of tapping into affinity groups and affinity spaces [@gee_what_2004].  Gee's (2004b) work on games and associated culture as learning experiences is founded on his understanding of how the engender a shared discourse and emerging identities .

Kafai and Burke's extensive work proposes applying the power of Gee's work around the game playing to game making [@kafai_connected_2016, p. 56].

In addition, maker culture more generally is relevant due to the alignment with tinkering as educational practice in stem education, supported by family involvement and brokering of experiences. The details of tinkering as a pedagogical practice are explored in more detail in the literature review of this thesis.

### Context of Home Education and family learning

The move to family learning as a context suited the trajectory of my interests and the opportunities available as part of University context.

Many professional programmers began with support provided by family.

Barron and Livingstone have outlined the advantages and processes involved in family involvement of technology use and learning in the home. There is clearly an inequality of access to these well paid profession that the development of the computing curriculum and the skills based and creative process focus that was part of the initial narrative is laudable the aims of equality.

However the practical and and cultural difficulties of undertaking a project-based approach withing the curriculum are significant. Factors of difficulties associated with technology projects compound difficulties.

In this research I made the decisions not to focus on the adaptation  of a  informal club approach to the restrictions of in-school classes but rather instead to embrace key elements of it and to explore processes in situ. While the context of home education is not a core to the goals of this research it is important to situate this study accurately.

**Outline of the home eduction context of this study:** The processes and motivations driving of home education are varied [@fensham-smith_invisible_2021]. Classic ideas of reasons for HE include pedagogy and ideology [@galen_home_1991] [@rothermel_can_2003], and often both. My involvement with home ed networks stemmed from University outreach work. In the following section I draw on relevant research to identify characteristics and motivations of the networks and families that I tapped into.

- Unschooling, Holt, drawing out interests of children in everyday activities and facilitating learning around that [@gray_challenges_2013]
- Webs of learning Illich - home ed families active in identifying networks to tap into [@doroudi_relevance_2023] has a relevance with social networking groups and email lists used by home educators to share and align activities.

## The importance of understanding Projects and socio cultural and activist concepts of Activity

In this section I briefly explain CHAT as a suitable choice to explore this research based around a shared project.

I also problematise educational projects beyond the sometimes superficial take on educational project in schools with wider concepts derived from the socio cultural tradition.

While the kind of learning explored in this study may not traditionally be thought of as an activist project, I find synergies between activist conceptions of education and learning and my wider concerns in a modest but achievable way. Specifically as a desire to move beyond curricular and technical concepts of computational thinking to wider concerns based on empowerment [@lee_none_2016].   

In addition the wider framework of CHAT is optimistic but realistic in the focus on the possibility of change.

This process links back to my own feelings of entrapment, powerlessness and guilt after being involved with wider activist movements and projects. I want to be able to give detailed tools of critically analysis that do not paralyse but also do not unthinkingly evangelise social change in ways which may be unsafe or unrealistic.


### Why this study is needed

Theories of situated learning view transmission of educational practice as a thorny problem as the process of learning is dependant on many contextual factors.

Thus why would this study based on observations of one context be of use?
Thoughts:  
  - similar contexts exist 
  - underlying treads may emerge which may transcend context  



## Summary of the thesis structure

### Research Questions

- What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to game coding and design?
<!-- - What pedagogical factors are significant to support novices learning coding, particularly in game making contexts? -->
- How can participants build agency in an evolving community of game makers?
- How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?


### Chapter outline

As has been outlined in this introduction the a leading thread of the thesis is my desire to better understand my own experience as a facilitator of learners creating media and digital products in relation with existing research.

This chapter has been structured around key contextual factors that have spurred this inquiry and which have emerged from observational research and integrating existing theoretical understandings in this area.

While the immediate goal of understanding learning happening in temporary informal environments of learning coding, the findings have implications that of interest to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners who are looking to nurture creative and/or technical design practices in novice learners.  

In line with a situated view of learning the details of process of coding are important. Thus one of the challenges of this work is to explore the details to a non-expert audience. While the literature review will begin to disambiguate some of the terms used in the thesis there is in addition a glossary which outlines short definitions of technical terms used. The glossary is included as an appendix to this study and a summary table is present as an introductory section to the literature review.

The literature review begins the exploration of the key themes and threads that are integral to the findings of this study. These include:

- authenticity in project based approaches
- nature of informal settings, in particular home education, and the possibilities offered compared to school lesson settings - PERHAPS IN INTRO INSTEAD
- barriers to participation in digital making and pedagogies to create inclusive learning environments
- key accessible pedagogies to help learning coding for young people

Chapter three outlines the theoretical framework and the key methodologies of this study. I explain how the underlying approach of design based research (DBR) aligns well with the aims of the research questions and the use of concepts from the socio cultural school of activity theory and narrower techniques and terminology of what is termed third generation activity theory (3GAT). In doing so I explore the direction of travel of 3GAT and increasing synergies with DBR as methodologies which suit both intervention by researchers into the learning environment being studies and corresponding input by research participants in the resulting design. This mutually created and emergent nature of the resources and processes that were created and adopted becomes a key theme of the thesis.

In the second part of the chapter, I outline the process of how data was gathered, processed and collected using screen capture and 360 cameras which had been inspired by partnership work between EdLab and the Biosocial Lab. I explore the challenge of gathering large amounts of research data and resulting prioritisation that resulted.   

The following chapter outlines the learning design that emerged from the research programme.

### Overall key messages & contribution to Knowledge

This research is valid in the following ways:

- generative nature of research. It has created teaching resources
- the detail of game making pedagogy, suitable for other researcher and Teachers
- tools are novel - media practices are situated, thus will differ with technology
- application of guided participation as lens to this domain
- something about methods using 360 and screen capture?


### Link to next chapter

It is worth noting at this stage that the process of being guided by personal interests, those of participants and creating and designing
This chapter has explored the context of HE, informal science learning and specifically computer coding and game making. The pedagogies of those areas are explored in the next chapter.
