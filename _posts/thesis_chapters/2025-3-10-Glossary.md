# Glossary


<!-- NOTE THIS COULD MAKE UP PART OF THE LITERATURE REVIEW AS A MORE CONCISE WAY TO COVER A LOT OF GROUND - AND BOOKMARKED BY A JUSTIFICATION - THE COMPLEXITY IS IN THE MIX OF CONCEPTS AND IN LATER CHAPTERS.
PERHAPS ORGANISE BY CHAPTER?

Or perhaps group terms by theme, include references in each description with examples and characteristics. Then have a short complex commentary at the end of each section.   -->

### Methodology terms

**Contradictions:** A key term in the expansion of the learning activity

### Other theoretical terms

**Flow:**
<!-- is this needed to complement computational fluidity. -->


### Overall terms

**Learning design:** The term used for a set of resources and pedagogical techniques introduced by myself as a facilitator of coding sessions. The following terms are used as synonym at times to avoid a repetitive writing style: _learning intervention_ and _game making pedagogy_. Wider terms are used which encompass non-designed elements for example _learning activity_.

**Digital making:** A broad field involving the maker community, physical computing and participation in on-line digital making communities.

**Game making:** In the context of this study game making is the overall process of constructing a game which may include coding elements but may also involve creating graphical assets and planning activities.

**Design process:** Design process in this context can refer to any of the different stages of imagining, planning and constructing and testing the digital game.

**Game coding:** In the context of this study game making refers to the aspect of game making which involved interacting and changing the code aspect of the game object.

### Context / Community

**Coder Dojo:** A community of volunteers running informal education sessions aimed at young people and their families. The initiative has been taken under the arm of the Raspberry Pi foundation.

**Game Jam:** A term applied to events creating games used in diverse contexts including professional game coders, enthusiasts and at times young learners. The term is explored in more detail in Chapter 2.

### Pedagogies and Design Concepts

**Pair programming:** Beyond a more general description of two people coding a task side by side, this terms also describes a  

**Use - Modify - Create:** A computing and digital media creation pedagogy that outlines the advantages of starting with working code examples before progressing to writing code structures from first principles. The term is explored in more detail in Chapter 2.

**Bartle's Player Types:** The grouping of different player types reflects a design concept that players play games for different motivations. Bartle's proposed types are frequently framed as the following: Achiever, Killer, Explorer, Socialiser. For example, Killer / Griefer refers to a player who often engages in a process of playing against the norms of the game for entertainment value. This can be disruptive in the context of a group game.   

**Computational Fluidity:** Relates both to flow experience (see above) and Resnick's interpretation which emphasises the importance of participants self-expression in computer coding project.

#### perhaps not needed.

**Process Drama:** A way of exploring topics using dramatic techniques to explore situations, professional contexts or wider topics. The work of Dorothy Heathcote on process drama is influential in shaping conceptions of what is possible in school contexts particularly in her use of guided role play and cross-circular work.



### General Coding / Technical Terms

**Variables / Game variables:** A variable is a coding term used to describe a code value which is often set at the start of a code project. A game variable in the context of this study refers to aspect such as the value of gravity, or player movement speed which the novice coder can alter to impact the behaviour of their game.

**Code Playground:** A website allowing the running of code projects within a testing environment, often focusing on web page technologies. They are used initially to share code problems in context to allow specific help from forums. They have developed into communities which allow for the showcasing of new techniques and as educational tools to allow learners to experiment with web coding project without access to a development web server. The term is explored in more detail in Chapter 2.

**Code snippets:** Extracts of code which may be contained in a code playground project or as part of other documentation. The motivation for sharing is so other coders can copy, paste and then adapt the code into their own projects.

**Code syntax errors:** Errors to do with the grammar of the code.

**JavaScript library/framework:** A collection of one or more files of JavaScript code which abstract away specialised abilities which can be reused by other   

### Technical Game Terms

**Game Mechanic:** Game mechanics are a form of game design pattern.

**Game Polish / Aesthetics:** The aesthetic or polish of the game is often thought of a surface covering which does not impact the underlying game mechanics, dynamics but does have an impact on the affect of the participant.

**Game states:** Game states and functions to create the game loop are included natively in the phaser framework [@faas_introduction_2017; @kostolny_digital_2017]

**Game loop:**
