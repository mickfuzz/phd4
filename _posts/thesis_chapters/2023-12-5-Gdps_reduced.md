### Chapter outline

In the last chapter I outlined use of tools in detail. In the next chapter I outline this use of key inclusive pedagogical methods that helped participants become part of an emerging community of game makers.

This chapter analyses activity at a scope between the concrete tool use and the wider cultural context of the game making community. The particular focus is the implementation of individual game design patterns (GDPs). This chapter addresses how data gathered informs thinking on the research question how can game design patterns support the development of coding practices by novices?

This chapter begins with reframing of game design patterns and game play design patterns which builds on the previous chapters description of the emerging learning design. Following this a Vignette of parent child interaction in game making process introduces an overview of interactions of that pair generated from analysis of video data.

The chapter then focuses on the use of game design patterns by participants
drawing on detailed observations of practice. A discussion section explores implications and observations from these findings in relation to existing research and concepts. As part if this discussion, I draw on the examples of use of game design patterns in practice to explore the analysis of GDPs as a mid-level construct, of use both to designers and as a pedagogical tool for those seeking to help novice coders become inculcated into a coding community.

### On GDP as a germ-cell and unit of analysis

In the introduction, I outlined some of the broader challenges of sharing practice and research to practically support the learning of coding practices beyond the immediate context of the research in question. The choice of what scope of activity to examine in detail is relevant to this challenge. While this concept of germ cell / unit of analysis a is more typically used in a larger scope of societal activity, the principles apply this smaller scope. For a study of this nature, too broad an analysis risks insufficient detail to allow replication, too narrow risks being overly context dependant and limiting the potential for wider application.

This chapter centres on the exploration of the implementation of game design patterns (GDPs) as a key objective of in a way which correlates with the mid-level activity described in the last chapter. The same concept can be expressed using AT terminology as the use of GDPs as a unit of analysis or germ-cell of activity, two similar concepts with slightly different foci.

<!-- Mid-level construct of design / patterns heuristics [] -->

    ... the germ-cell and the unit of analysis are one and the same thing, but in one case the developmental aspect is emphasised and in the other case the analytical aspect is emphasised. [@blunden_unit_2020]


As a designer / researcher and practitioner both aspects are relevant and are explored separately in the following two sections.

IS THIS NEEDED HERE? OR REDO THIS.
**It is thus potentially helpful to undertake a deeper analysis of the design patterns** and specifically game design patterns at this point.  Recap on the value of design patterns in learning design which exist at different scopes of activity [@mcandrew_patterns_2006].(CHECK THIS)
How design patterns interplay with design principles and how the process relates to design based research  [@linn_science_2006].


<!-- #### On GDPs as a concept to help analysis -->

<!-- MOVE TO METHODOLOGY - JUST GET ON WITH IT?
Blunden cites the process of identifying a germ cell of activity as a fruitful process for researchers [FIND]. In addition, Engestrom frames expansive learning as instructive for organisational change. While research is more sparse in the field of educational practice, the principles are frequently applied to classroom practice. -->


<!-- My decision to privilege the implementation of each GDP as the main objective  activity system mirrors choices by other researchers valuing  -->

A granular exploration of the tensions and processes at work in a complex educational environment can via identifying emerging barriers and responses to comprehension, communication and practical barriers to implementing design challenges facilitates replicability of research and supports its potential value to other practitioners [@barab_using_2002]. However, despite the value of a micro approach which includes close analysis of implementation of code structures. The process of seeking and defining a key activity scope/unit for analysis helps define useful boundaries of what to analyse in depth, thus help avoid over-scoping of the study in which preludes a greater depth of analysis.

Thus, while in this study activity covers a full spectrum of activity in other chapters, this chapter focuses on the implementation of GDPs in greater depth allowing for the identification of  patterns of design stages involving discussion, planning, implementation and playtesting after each new game element. At this scope, each GDP can be seen as a project, taken here as a concrete implementation of a planned goal. This sentiment is echoed by a parent when noticing that the documentation on one GDPs involved several distinct stages - "It’s like a project in itself really!".

<!-- THERE IS OVERLAP HERE WITH THE LAST CHAPTER - HOW TO REMOVE THAT AND RETAIN CLARITY ?

Thus in this study activity covers a full spectrum including close analysis of implementation of code structures. However these smaller operations are not worthy of being treated as an activity system in full. WHY MAKE THIS POINT. wHAT IS THE OVERALL MOTIVATION HERE?  -->





<!--
#### On GDPs as a germ concept to help practical development -->

<!-- NOTE - removed -  what is the germ cell of the overall game making activity. -->

GDPs emerged as a unit of analysis through their initial observation of GDPs as a germ-cell being used at different phases / scope of the learning design as it evolved. Chapter four charts the evolution of the use of GDPs in the learning design from participant led brainstorming of desired features, to self-contained tutorials and code snippets. This then was enriched by wider framework from academia, professional community and and the work of educational Game Jams, the UMC framework.

The design process is described as a mutual, i that while I led the production of the resources, I was driven by the explicit requests and implicit needs of the community and resulting feedback. The resulting design included a themed collection of GDPs



<!-- around, game mechanics, game space, game polish and game challenges. -->

<!-- LATER?
AT provides a concept of rising to the concrete which invites analysis of how the construct of  GDPs can be be adapted to serve the development of a game making community at different scopes of activity. To illustrate this concept we can use Marx's concept of exchange as a germ-cell for analysis of capitalism.  -->
<!-- The previous chapter described the  key elements of the learning design that were in place by P2 ( remixing from a game template, use of distributed asset creation showcasing and social playtesting).  The shared tools and documentations began to shape goal setting around implementing new features, some where held in common with other groups. -->


The core concept of altering a game at the level of gameplay design pattern which emerged from experimental pilot process is adapted by participants and used in various forms of activity.

At a larger level, the amalgamation of the GDPs into a finished game, is key to the success of the project. Good games communicate their affordances, (in the form of GDPs) to the player without the need for extensive additional documentation [@gee_learning_2005].

This process also communicates GDPs implicitly to players, a process borne out by brainstorming sessions early in the process which say participants listing GDPs or variants of them without explicit guidance in this direction. This  goal setting and implementation using GDP as a bse developed into a principle activity of P1 with varied results.

By P2, to support a scaffolded entry to this practice, I developed quick start activities which proposed micro level code modification rather than implementing new code structures. While they were distinct in their pedagogy use, these shot-cuts  stemmed from the same germ-cell base of altering the game through transforming GDPs.

In addition to support their identification of the different elements that make up a game I created a sheet which drew on existing work framework (mechanics, space, goals, etc) to scaffold the process.






## Study of Vignette A

In this section, to give an overview of the specifics of the learning design, and participant interactions I use vignette to give a snapshot of the interactions of one family. This comprises a table of participant dialogue, screenshots and description of their interactions including gestures followed by a summary interpretation of interactions.

_Context:_ For the previous five minutes the parent and child dyad have faced a blockage of a glitch in the software which prevents their wider objective of adding game design pattern of adding keys and doors to their game. In short, in this pattern the users must collect a key and then navigate to a door to progress to the next level. The parent Sh has been trying many different things and changing things in the code while the child Th has been expressing boredom. In response, Sh has expressed frustration and irritation. Finally Sh suggests that Th asks the facilitator Mick for help to resolve the coding blockage.

### Descriptive Commentary on Vignette A

The parent has taken on the role of solving harder code problems following  instructions carefully. The child is one of the younger participants when blockages occur she explores the room or to dwell on the periphery of other participants interactions. As well as the key and door pattern which has just been implemented, the child also wants to add additional levels to the game. In this and the previous sessions several young participants had added levels to their games and this GDP sparked discourse between participants. It is likely that this Th's interest stems at least in part from observations of other participants games and this discourse.

The key and door pattern is one of the harder ones to implement as it involves adding two new functions, which while simple enough, represent new code structures and thus this adds a new level of conceptual and practical complexity. This is borne out in the coding blockage the family found themselves in the first part of the session. The supporting resources for this pattern are included in Appendix 6.x. The parent finally circumnavigates the conflict of her own hesitancy regarding asking for facilitator help by sending out her child to ask. REWRITE IN SANNINO TERMS.

<!--
The supporting resources are available here.
https://en.flossmanuals.net/phaser-game-making-in-glitch/_full/#game-mechanic-keys-and-doors -->

Both parent and child show explicit and implicit awareness of game making patterns. For example, one target game design pattern _Keys and Doors_ is repeated in a sing song voice by the child along with chivvying to the mother to get started on it.

There is also awareness of the conventions of a platformer game as a dynamic system in way which drives their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game.  An understanding of the game as a dynamic system is seen clearly in the parent’s alarm at the child’s deletion of all elements of hazard. This interaction shows the parent guiding the child to imagine the user experience (LINK WITH HCI TERMS) through the use of terms from GDPs. The parent uses GDPs as a prompt that they are designing for others. The child has also thought ahead to this time of playtesting. Both child and parent make reference to the imagined player experiences. In the vignette above Sh mentions "it's no fun if their are no hazards". The response of Th "It is for me." indicates an awareness of the conventions and a desire to play against them. The child articulate her motivation to _surprise_ players.

Game making patterns are outlined by both the child and parent. They talk of adding more levels, of the mechanic of keys and doors in this vignette. After a blockage caused by debugging coding is removed, the parent immediately re-engages the child. The parent says "Did you see Th?" and then prompts the child to play-test the game. The child is keen to both replicate the GDP of keys and doors in the second level and to add a new GDP of adding additional levels to the game.  

The implementation of a new GDP involve adding new code to the game. The amount of code and/ changes needed varied depending on its complexity. Larger changes typically need more careful manipulation of code and subsequent debugging. For this pair, these more involved coding activities were beyond the ability of the child.

For this child developed a cyclicar pattern of alternation between higher and lower engagement with the coding processes based on lower engagement the period of time when her parent was problem solving code and higher engagement once it was implemention of the structural element was almost complete. Completion of the code implementation of a GDP allows for new possibilities in design dynamics using the same text matrix level design tool. This stage of working on a new GDP sustains the child's activity. The child shows high engagement at this stage outlining her plan for implementing the pattern in the process of designing their game. sPECIFICALLY SAYING X, Y Z.

As the child progress from making changes to then testing them her engagement stays high. In this example, the process of playtesting also involves the child speaking and identification of modifications to and new GDPs to implement.

<!-- ### Gdp and motivation -->
<!-- I propose that a contributing factor to this motivation is the ability to replicate a familiar pattern of game play via her own work in construction. It is the ability to translate this home knowledge into her own artefact which gives a sense of mastery over an otherwise foreign environment. -->
<!-- The process of personal development of knowledge is less clear from video data.
NOTE - SOME MORE READING ON AN INTERPRETATION OF THIS THAT I CAN WORK WITH FOR THIS DATA IS PERHAPS NEEDED. -->

In the programme Sh has built important proficiency in coding practice, which include; finding and comprehending supporting documentation, fluidly navigating between undertaking more advanced coding to implement new GDPs, playtesting and preparing the coding environment for more basic coding of her child. The parent navigates this process skilfully and is able to incorporate the child's interests. She takes signals clearly to her child when the process returns certain design stages indicating that she is aware of the greater possibility for effective child input at these moments.

While this adult structured the process of implementing new GDPs through engaging with documentation in a careful and methodical  way, other individuals and pairs approached the same objectives in diverse ways. This chapter now expands to represent the diversity  of the coding and community practices of participants through focusing on their use of game design patterns. (and opportunities for educators)


<!-- The child uses her concepts of game design patterns in the end of course evaluation. She responded to the question _What would you like to see next time? What would you add?_ with the comment. "Th: I'd add a health bar and lots more levels and keep on changing the characters and background." -->

## Observations and analysis of use of Game Design Patterns by participants

NOTE HOW THESE FINDING ARE STRUCTURED. MOVE TO INTRO?

In the previous chapter the role of cultural activities to engage and sustain engagement in this game making programme were examined. This chapter allows us to develop this direction to focus in on the way design patterns used are by parents, children and facilitators in in this emerging game making community.

Acknowledging that these observation do not fall nearly into each of the three planes, I begin with those oriented more to cultural focus before progressing to  observations oriented chiefly to interpersonal activity and  then ending with some observation on GDPs impact on personal knowledge construction.

## Guided Particpation


### GDPs used to scaffold ideation processes

**GDPs are used in a variety of ways to guide the ideation process via restriction of choice in pattern collection, starting template includes core dynamics, visual code structures of GDPs suit rapid prototyping.**

The design chapter explored the tension between reduced choice of genre of game. In my journal notes and observations of the games created, I note that the provision of a graphical menu of GDPs significantly decreased in time spend in ideation phase by providing scaffolding and a restriction of choice. Analysis of participant use of the menu as detailed in the documentation section above Te supports this analysis. Other techniques that leveraged the characteristics of game design patterns to support the ideation process emerged in community design activities.

<!-- The reduction on the length of the course was welcome show by Ma's comment. "It did go on for too long." -->

**Paper prototyping mapping visual matrix**

NOTE - PERHAPS MOVE THIS TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER / METHODS? NOT GDP SPECIFIC? OR PART OF STARTING DESIGN

The use of paper prototypes was one technique used by several parents to support their children to form and develop their design ideas. In our starting vignette the parent notices the child's difficulty in using cursor and delete/backspace keys to edit a matrix allowing level design. The parent provides a book with grid paper to allow the child to replicate the matrix. The parent is then able to transcribe the design to the code example while engaging the child by checking she has interpreted the design correctly.

![](./Pictures/vign_a_1.png)
![Graphical representation of code]({{ site.baseurl }}/Pictures/vign_a_1.png)

The way the code is structured has been chosen to allow a graphical analogue between the lines of code in the form of a comma separated array and the appearance of the resulting game output on the screen. The parent uses the graphical representation of design in the code template as a jumping off point to make a connection to home practice of sketching things out in paper. The process of turn the sketched into reality on the screen and sharing with others appears to be transformative in terms of the engagement level of the child.

<!-- NOTE - RETURN TO THIS IN ANALYSIS OF TADS - -->
<!-- - in planning stages the parent provides scaffolding to help the child.
When GDP was completed and participant or pair move to a new phase there is evidence of a reenergising effect.
More on role of parent and child to negotiate approaches which maximise engagement / progress / keep flow .
Somethinkg about more direct link between code and output. - as with block coding - this is an intermediate step.
-->

<!-- There are other examples of the use of paper prototyping of GDPs being used by parents to provide scaffolding for their children. When invited to share about their design process in a post session interview, Fi and Ma also discuss the use of paper to clarify initial GDP ideas in interview data. When asked if they were able to Ma prompts

    Mi: Tell me a  bit  how you came up with those aims in your game, in terms of coming up with a plan.
    Ma: What for the things that we need to do to it to finish it?
    Mi: Yeah. Oh, just even from the beginning point. How did you plan together as well?
    Ma: Well we started off on paper didn’t we. That's the first thing we did. I think it was a benefit actually. We, we did a lot of sketching didn’t we and a lot of brainstorming ideas and seeing and trying to test out whether it would work.

Later in the interaction, the parent outlines a different use of prototyping, that of sketching directly into software. For this pair, the child appears to prefer sketching directly into software. The father also appreciates potential problems of translating ideas from paper into a digital format.

    Ma: I was very excited by seeing Fi playing with this because it's interesting that everything doesn't have to be a paper and pen.
    It's nice to just for the kids to feel that they can sketch on Piskel straight off the bat without taking a tutorial or being told by an adult.  It's really intuitive and you just go straight into it.
    Mi: That's an interesting thing because in some ways it started off with people working on paper because I thought that would be really accessible. Yeah. And maybe it was through observations of people just going “Do you know what I’m just happy sketching on Piskel”.
    Ma: (Animatedly) The kids, all the kids I saw not just Fi.
    Mi: Digital sketching.
    Ma: Yeah.
    Mi: It seemed to have value in that you were just doing it in the same format that you would use for the game.

    Ma:   Yeah. I think it's really important. I think the pencil and pen thing just didn't work did it. We sketched... It's got its place. But it's, the kids weren't that interested in using the graph paper to block out Piskel. It didn't translate. It was just easier to block it out straight in software. -->

another pair's ideation helped by the use of a GDPs is the following example which shows Te and Da are creating a new tilemap for a maze game. Te is able to map existing knowledge of tools and home knowledge of the kid of game he is imagining to rapidly make revisions.

    Te: Oo. Shall we try to make it (unintelligible). Cos in pac man you can go off the edge.
    Da: and you wrap round the other way?
    Da: Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Save that for version 1.1
    Te continues making changes to the code design.
    Da: What’s the theme? What are you drawing?
    Te: What? I’m trying to make like a pac-man type thing.
    Da: Alright. What if you sketched it on paper first? Or have you got it in your head?
    Te: I’m just kinda going for it it. (laughs)
    Da: Ok go for it, see what you get up to.
    Te: I’ll leave a hole there.

As aligned with the learning design principle of rapid feedback, changes in the code which Te is altering to impact on the new design pattern of a top down game, are immediately apparent in the preview window. As such, Te does not feel the need to prototype on paper.

**Other examples of GPDs helping the ideation process**

NOTE - TO DEVELOP AFTER MORE ANALYSIS OF VIDEO DATA.
The use of GDPs to scaffold the ideation process was a common pattern used by X of the Y sessions analysed.

In summary, some GDPs allow the spacial exploration of design in a way that suits being mapped onto paper, or onto graphical software which allows for a similar sketching experience.  

<!-- This pattern completion is mirrored in the work of other pairs. Thus replicating is a kind of participation in an emerging community.
There is also a link made by the parent to previous working practices. Using a paper book to make a sketch of the work to be completed. -->
<!-- These kinds of shifts of activity and cultural practices brought by the participants also feed into the ongoing culture of the game making community. For example the use of paper designs and paper prototyping that for some of the home ed families was a familiar practice was something that I adopted more broadly after observing the families involved. -->

<!--
NOTE - IS THIS ALREADY COVERED IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER - COMPLEX DESIGN PROCESSES? ()

- Well suited to build a repeated design practice.
- Especially with starting documents,
- Small changes had big effects.
- Variable changes needed immediate testing.  

While the design suits repeated design practice as illustrated by the example above, not all pairs or individuals interacted with GDP in such a neat way.

A later discussion section in this chapter illustrates a more complex interaction with design stages. -->



#### GDPs as used by participants in their  prioritisation in the design process

**GDPs are mentioned by name and via verbal and physical descriptions as a lingua franca and as shortcuts by participants when prioritising work**

<!-- informal task division -->
The following exchange between participants Fi and Ma shows GDPs being used to try to organise future activity.
<!-- Online version as table -  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLx8j9djYqJdZHwKJ09mmIDMYO7YqlMDhuHx2hiqpJI/edit -->

    TURN IN TO TABLE WITH DESCRIPTION
    Ma: I’ve brought the music, and also we could just concentrate on one thing and just change that. You know, keep working through.
    Fi: Yeah. I think I want to get an enemy in - oh no - my person animated.
    Ma: So you want to get your person animated that’s the main thing.
    Ma: Shall we concentrate on that and changing the platforms into something different?
    Fi: Yeah.
    Ma: Yeah?
    Fi: I also want to make a theme tune.
    Ma: Yeah. It’s, that’s what I mean, you can’t just skip around like that.
    Fi: Hmmm.
    Ma: Just cos it gets really overwhelming.
    Ma: Yeah..? So…?
    Long pause.
    Ma: Well I’ll have a look at the code and see if I can make sense of that.

At this point the parent engages with a print out of supporting documentation on added an animation to the main character. This example shows the use of the approximate names of a number of game design patterns by the child adult. These are _get the person animated_, _get an enemy in_, _changing the platforms into something different_, _make a theme tune_. At this stage of their process, some of these patterns have been discussed and sketched out some started but only partially completed. For example, the child has designed different frames of animation but this has not been exported to the right format or implemented in code form. This interchange shows a tension between a more chaotic style of working jumping from one goal to another and a parental motivation to prioritise one work to be done. This tension is outlined when the parent gives an update on progress.  

<!-- Patterns and the multiple actions and operations they entail are referred to briefly using short cut names.   -->

    Mick: Hello.
    Ma: Hi Mick.
    Ma: So, we’ve made quite a lot of progress this week. I think the issue we’re having is that Fi’s super excited so we’re kind of jumping from one thing to another and that’s kinda overwhelming me a bit.

The child's initial listing of features is a brainstorming technique. Such techniques are used to aid a creative process. However the parent seems to lack a process to map these out and then to work together to prioritise them. Instead he appears to be keen to quickly pick one. His suggested process is to then work through the documentation on that pattern. Fi appears reluctant to adopt this working process which creates a tension which is do
explore in the next part of this chapter.

<!-- Discussion later or before??? Maps -
GDP are already being used as a way to set goals, track progress and prioritise but the process seems stressful or unsatisfactory. Some kind of support help scaffold this process would be potentially productive. Changes to the emerging 3M design to  provide such support are explored in the following chapter. -->

**Other examples of use of GDPs for prioritisation** can be seen in the following participants.
TO COME

<!--

We can compare this drawn out process with a more rapid prioritisation guided by a parent with more experience in software development.
Te and Da are discussing possible features early in the process if ideation.

They thinking of a feature – wrap around like Pac-man
Da – Yeah we can do that. Save that for version 1.1

### GDPs offer the potential to assist project navigation, acting as a framework for code examples and step-by-step tutorials

DRAW ON CHAPTER 4 MUTUAL EVOLUTION - AND FIND EXAMPLES .

**The process of choice, use of documentation to support implementation and testing pivots on the design pattern and its behaviour.**



<!-- #### Use of simple code examples which demonstrate the pattern in isolation -->
<!--NOTE DEVELOP THIS EXAMPLE - RELATE TO PRACTICE OF CODE PATCHING (EXPLORED IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER) -->
<!-- Code examples were initially the starting resource. The idea being it was quick to see the behaviour in context. The, use of code examples by Te in 2019-05-08 shows the effectiveness of the use of code examples by participants.  -->

NOTE - In the most straight forward way this is driven by a design decision to base supporting resources around GDPs,

The vignette in chapter four outlined the process of Toby finding a GDP to implement and adding it to his game.  
Insert table from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYuwJe4GbbGtZQttIz1mP1wYNPAwaPErr7BNjmbRmBM/edit#

The timings of the process of patching the code show that the learner is hesitant in the process. He checks the code and then checks the game output to test that the code creates the desired behaviour. Once this is verified he progresses to copy and paste the code from the create function of the sample code to the create function of his own source code.

The process of choice, use of documentation to support implementation and testing pivots on the design pattern and its behaviour.

<!-- NOTE - PERHAPS INTEGRATE PART OF THE CODE PATCHING PROCESS FOR THIS SECTION -->

NOTE - WHAT IS IN THE DESING CHAPTER ?
<!-- Towards the end of phase 1 I began to create code examples to illustrate of how particular commonly requested game features were implemented. These barebone game projects were hosted on a code playground. An online document in our shared google drive working space linked to these examples. I would help participants access this when they requested a certain feature. This list of game features began to grow. For phase one these code example were not particularly successful at increasing learner independence. There were differences in the code structure of their games and the examples and translation was not intuitive. -->


Direct help between peer participants, as outlined other section, was a key process of the game making community from early stages.

However, to overcome scarcity of facilitator support, direct help processes were seeded by other forms of support resources and written documentation.

At this phase of research documentation included; comment help within the game template; a step-by-step tutorial which build up the code of the starting template and explore the computing concepts, a menu of self-contained code examples of game elements game elements or game design patterns (GDPs); supporting tutorials briefly explaining how to add the new code needed to implement the patterns. The tutorials to implement GDPs were available online and also as printed A4 hand outs which were provided on request of the older participants.

The contents of the tutorials which gave examples of the game design patterns are explored in the following chapter. However the form of the tutorials as code examples and some of the initial and emerging processes that they supported are explored in this chapter.

<!-- NOTE REMOVED
This section prioritises describing the code patching process using examples and guided instructions rather than the first principles.   -->

Not all participants engaged with written tutorials. This observation is supported by research which encourages varied approaches beyond instruction-based approaches.  [@dietz_design_2021; @resnick_coding_2020]. [SEE LIT REVIEW ON NON-TUTORIAL PEDAGOGIES]. Written instructions provide barriers of literacy and change of habit explored in previous studies [@blunden2014seeking] which explore linking to written instructions within the drama frame provides greater incentive to engage in this way.



<!--

NOTE THIS HAS BEEN REMOVED

## The use of GDPs examined from an interpersonal focus

This section examines the use of GDPs to facilitate guided participation via interpersonal interactions in game making. Guided participation in this context involved, guidance on organising design activities, various forms of problem solving and help to shift design perspectives. While the primary source of material is from pair interactions between children and parents, at times peer interaction between non-pairs developed into guidance. For example, in the in the example above where Te provides assistance for Ch1 in adding levels to his game. -->


### GDPs aiding the process of division of labour

NOTE - DIVISION OF LABOUR IS IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER TOO - REWRITE BASED ON GDP ONLY CONTENT

**Participants can split work and resolve working blockages by allocating different GDPs or parts thereof.**


Different pairs approached division of labour in various ways. In a later example, we see how although Mi and her daughter Ne are working on different projects on a fair distance from each other, Mi relies on Ne's coding help. Sh and Th relied on the parent to do the majority of code implementation and shared one computer. The opening vignette shows the child use the name of a GDP as a way to communicate about the shared work of making a game.

     Th: Go on then. Key - Door - Person.
     Sh: Person?
     Th: Key Door Person.
     T gestures with her hands to indicate that her mother is the person she is referring to.

The utterance by the child "Key Door Person"  work on the game design pattern called Keys and Doors to the adult. The child appears to consider the level of complexity needed to add a new pattern into the code to be beyond her ability and thus directly delegate the task to her mother. Feedback from the parent indicated that this division of labour was partly due to reading ability.  

    "Th got on better during the coding once the student who was hovering initially left us alone. Because every time Th hesitated, she jumped in to do it for her. Whereas I know her better so can judge how to facilitate more minimally, and I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles.  Plus she can't read yet, so she was recognising the relevant bits of code by matching the individual letters, which takes longer."

The parent outlines her strategies used to address lack of reading ability as a barrier to participation. The design choice of a grid of letters representing different elements of the platform game appears appropriate in the case of a novice learning to code and read at the same time.  After the child has delegated a coding task to her mother she undertakes other activities. At times her activities directly contribute to the main goal of game making. At times the parent asked the child to seek help from facilitator. On another occasion when the child appeared bored of waiting for parent to solve a code problem, she approached the facilitator to ask for help on behalf of the adult without prompting. At other times she engages more peripheral activities such as watching older children playtest each others games, or observing community activity from under the table.


In the last section, Mark and Ed used GDPs to attempt to prioritise work. However, following this Ma is engaged puzzling over documentation on how to add animation to a character for some time. This results in Fi being blocked from progressing. In the next exchange, they progress to more successfully divide their labour informally.

    Ma: Quite complicated. But we can do it. But it would mean a lot of mucking around
    Fi: Ah Er
    Ma: Which is difficult to do while we’re here. But it’s doable.
    Ma: It’s like a project in itself really.
    Fi: Project in itself?
    Ma: Yeah! (laughing). I just want to know like. We can get him in. So if I ask about the sizing.
    Fi: Hmmn
    Ma: I think you can edit the size here.
    Fi: Why don’t you go here for a computer and you can do that?
    Ma: Why. What. While you’re doing what?
    Fi: Um making a sound track or something. I could do something like that.
    Ma: Ok. Yeah. I’ll see if there’s any more computers in the cupboard.

<!--
THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT
Or perhaps the parent steers the child into graphical areas as they are able to continue without stressing out the parent. Thus the child's
compliance may be a kind or pragmatic decision to allow smoother progress. -->

The father describes previous lack of prioritisation as 'skipping around like that' or 'jumping all over the place' as 'overwhelming' the child seems happy to takes a more piecemeal approach. The child suggests a possible resolution to the current blockage. He suggests splitting and using one laptop each. He names one of the other pattern. The listing of GDPs in the previous exchange seems to empower the young person to direct an informal division on labour. The child continues to work on parallel patterns or component actions of pattern using tools and processes which he is more familiar with. This child also begins researching other toolsets, in this session, research to identify an online tool to create an short audio soundtrack. This serves the child as it allows them to avoid waiting for their father and moving different parts of the overall project forward.

The implementation of some GDP involved the use of different tools and activities. As learners build the familiarity with the component actions needed to implement design patterns, some start to specialise as they divide labour between pairs or peers, For example in this case the child appears to make a tactical decision allowing the father to decipher technical instructions and implement them in the code of their game as they creating assets in non-code / GUI environments.

<!--
NOTE - MOVE TO LATER CHAPTER AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF FLEXIBLE DESIGN?

 While the father was keen to prioritise and then complete one pattern, the child takes a more piecemeal approach. Later in the session the father then gets drawn into creating audio assets after observing his son searching for suitable tools. The father becomes distracted from his stated task as he is responsive to help the child when they get stuck on an alternative pathway they have chosen to avoid waiting on the parent. While this may be stressful for the parent, lots of progress in the overall game project can be observed in any particular session and the child seems to be developing useful skills managing the parent. -->
 <!-- both with the familiar graphical asset tool Piskel and exploring new territory by researching an seeking a new tool for creating audio assets, specifically a background theme tune .  -->

 <!-- While there was no formal organising of groups in phase 2 and 3, the family bonds between parents and children created similar patterns of seeking validation, sharing planning. Although this was more the case for dyads working side-by-side on the same game, similar patterns existed for other configurations. -->

<!-- MORE EXAMPLES  ? -->
<!--
NOTE - check if this fits
Once the code for the new game mechanic has been added, the child is guided to take on challenge of making smaller changes that give rapid feedback.  To aid the process the parent navigates to a particular part of the code for child to alter design. The changes the child makes have a large impact on the end users experience.
 -->

NOTE - DIVISION OF LABOUR IS IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER TOO - REWRITE BASED ON GDP ONLY CONTENT

While the child's activity away from the screen and the main objective of coding and creating assets for their game could in a conventional educational model be seen an non-productive, in a community model of learning this can be interpreted differently. For example as legitimate peripheral activity [@lave_situating_1991], or as an observation stage of LOPI model [@rogoff_learning_2014].  The possibility for children to not engage in community activities is seen by Rogoff [-@rogoff_cultural_2003; -@rogoff_organization_2016] as an important characteristics in participation based models of learning.

<!-- COMMENTARY /WITH A FOCUS ON AGENCY -->

These divisions of labour seem beneficial for many participants however complex tensions emerge between varied goals as focal activities shift. Study of there interactions show the parents and children adopting varied strategies to navigate solutions to these tensions. The complexities of this design process are explored in more depth in the following discussion chapter.

<!-- NOTE - LINK TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER ON FLEXIBILITY OF DESIGN -->

<!-- In a following example we see child Ne helping her mother to overcome coding blockages. -->**
<!--
A SECTION HERE THAT COULD BE REPLACED.
Mi and Ne had a reverse relationship where the child would reluctantly implement the graphical changes in code but would pointedly not explain them seemingly taking pride in knowing something that her mother didn't.
ADD TRANSCRIPT EXAMPLE FROM  - 49:52.2 - 53:38.0 - 2019-03-18-mi
Here the child has a powerful position but misses a chance to develop useful communication skills.

The parent here takes great pride in the graphical work being done. This allows them a level of participation which is helpful without being stuck on more tricky technical or code related problems.
The design which allows choice of GDPs facilitates this. The process of building an identity as an individual or a family is shown in this families work on graphics.

### GDP driving adoption of emerging technical processes

**The emergence and propagation of new technical processes particularly in tool use, motivated by a drive to implement or complete a GDP often happen informally between peers.**

 The processes are not static but are modified by the community as they are adopted and passed on. Sometimes very explicitly as a parent explains, facilitates or guides a process as with Te and Da in the last chapter with documentation. At times technical processes are passed on informally in more casual help interactions as illustrated in the following example.

    NOTE - COVERT TO TABLE
    Mi continues to do solo design using the Piskel graphical too. She encounters a design problem. When erasing a part of the design she gets rid of background colour. Mi asks for help from partner but receives misleading advice which does not help her progress.
    Mi:  Oh no it’s not done that has it?

    Mi calls the name of her child across room with theatrical gesture and loud whisper voice
    Mi: “Ne!”
    Mi then makes face, wiggles head and shrugs at parent peer. The other parent laughs.
    Ne arrives to help.
    Mi: I’m trying to delete them but they turn light grey.
    Ne: So you want to get rid of them?
    Mi: What are you doing? You have to tell me what you are doing so I can do it myself.
    Mi: laughs
    Ne: laughs.
    Mi: I’ll just have to keep shouting at you if you don’t tell me.  
    Ne uses the mouse to select the grey background colour with the colour picker tool, then the pen tool to fill in gaps in the design. She then swaps the active colour back from grey to black by clicking the option to swap foreground and background colours.
    Mi - How did you do that so quickly? I’ve got to like, carefully... (makes hand gestures to show a sense of hesitant keyboard use)
    Parent peer laughs
    Ne bounces up in place and smiles broadly.
    Mi- Thanks
    Mi: So am I like back with the black now?  
    Ne: Yeah but if you want to delete it just press X (which switches between foreground and background colours) and then do it.
    Mi: Oh X. Alright Bubs. Thanks.

<!-- Taking a more focused view of the activity here would be implementing a game design pattern - e.g. adding keys and doors pattern in this case. On the level of action, creating a graphical asset of a key and adding this to the level design. The operation would be the exporting the graphical asset as a suitable file format from graphical design tool and uploading it to the code authoring tool. -->

In this interaction the parent is focused on completing the action of creating a graphical asset of a hazard as part of the activity of adding the GDP of including a hazard into the game. Ne appears reluctant to help at first and when she does she is mostly non-verbal and makes changes quickly in a way that her mother cannot initially follow or replicate. The process of explaining this to her parent would be more time consuming. There may also be a power dynamic happening as well with the child enjoying showing proficiency without sharing the process perhaps as a performative demonstration agency or growing status within this community.  

We can explore this behaviour from the child's perspective using terms from Activity Theory. The process of exporting and importing has become an 'operation' for Ne through repeated practice.  We can see that the operation of changing pen colours on the graphical tool is one which the child has been able to translate into a effortless process whereas the parent is still consciously building her competency. Ne has operationalised the process and it becomes part of the toolset of practices that she can draw on. Mi also benefits, as she is able to draw on the expertise of her child to undertake that process. She is also keen to develop her own competency as indicated by her asking child to explain the process.

<!-- While the final an operation for some participants it would be a more conscious process, for others it has become second nature. -->
<!-- This is seen in a similar example. As a common example the process of "getting it in the game".

    Mi - Ne!, Ne! Ne.

    Mi: Do you know how to get it in the game?
    Ne: Oh my god!
    Mi: Well . First of all save it to the gallery. How do you save it? Ah there you are. Save it. Is it saved?   Right now export it.
    Ne: Do you even know what export means?  
    Mi: I know what export means!
    Ne- Ok then smartie pants.

the interaction also shows positive affect of child.
her role in the community can be explored here. -->

#### GDPs used to nurture tactical responses to errors and blockages

In critique of online tutorials researchers note  few provide common errors[@kim_pedagogical_2017]. This lack of problem solving techniques communicated in online tutorials may addressed through use of GDPs.  

NOTE - rewrite the below highlighting the possibility of highlighting different possible errors and responses helped by the high level of context present in each

 How do you develop a more granular sense of the kinds of blocks, errors and how to overcome them.

 Professionals build up this sense through experience. While some practices are taught many others become ad-hoc rules of thumb that are difficult to communicate in abstract ways.

 More research would be welcome on how to help learners pick up these understandings.
 Further analysis of the different kinds of errors that are likely to arrive and testing different strategies for dealing with them that take into account the zone or proximal development of the participants may provide not only useful input for the participants, but also opportunities to check understandings of processes and game patterns and computational patterns in use.

 Question - do more useful / less de-motivating errors result from remixing and game patching?

 Question - what impact does the process of being driven by GDPs have on how users deal with errors? PERHAPS EXPLORE LATER?

 For example,  on into the detail and types or errors.  These include:

  -   **Syntax and Program Errors** are errors in your code which stop the game from functioning at all, often resulting in a blank screen.
  -   **No Behaviour Bugs** are errors which in your code which don't stop the game from functioning but your intended effect is not present when it should be.
  -   **Glitches** don't stop your game from running but as you play you see that there is an unintended effect. The game does something different from what we want it to do.


 Perhaps see the above glitch examples. Not fully understanding every line of code can create a fun, unpredictable environment. We can infer from these examples that wrong behaviour may be easier to investigate and to correct than no-behaviour errors. Aspects of the design encourage this kinds of error. Certainly the process of code patching does.

 <!-- ### On different kinds of snags / blockages

 PERHAPS MOVE BACK TO THE GDP CHAPTER IF SPACE?

 #### On Debugging and Embracing Different Types of Errors

 In analysis of journal notes and recorded screens I began to identify different kinds of problems that blocked participants from progressing. I refer to different kinds of blockages which result from tensions and contradictions between different elements in activity systems.

 Some blockages were non-technical including hunger or grumpyness between participants, others were due to lack of access to the right tools or understanding of processes, others were particular types of coding error. I propose that more granular understanding  of different kinds of design blocks can help facilitators and ultimately learners in building agency in their response to them.

 For example,  on into the detail and types or errors.  These include:

  -   **Syntax and Program Errors** are errors in your code which stop the game from functioning at all, often resulting in a blank screen.
  -   **No Behaviour Bugs** are errors which in your code which don't stop the game from functioning but your intended effect is not present when it should be.
  -   **Glitches** don't stop your game from running but as you play you see that there is an unintended effect. The game does something different from what we want it to do.
  -->

 <!-- #### Examples of Glitch types of errors

 Short examples of different types and the affect implications.

 Glitch errors can be productive.

 **Productive in exploring code / creating new game opportunites**
 An interesting one where the x / y axis mix up for Te 2019-03-18 leads to a new challenge in the game.

 **Productive in in**

 - Glitch - 2019-05-08 - Te and Da  - create moving enemy but it totally leaves the screen. This caused amusement and participants knew how they thought they would follow that up.

  The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful. -->



#### Use of GDPs to support debugging and the product revision process - EDIT DOWN AND MOVE

_NOTE - This section is particularly underdeveloped at this stage_

Many participants spent significant periods of time improving, testing and fixing coding errors in their games. Analysis of the coding of video data showed that revision and debugging was often a solo effort. In a way that mirrors the spread of other creative technical processes, certain revision and debugging practices that were transmitted through interaction with the facilitator that were adopted and used by the community. Some practices were straight-forward, for example the swift navigation between the source code window and a preview window of the live game. Others were more specialist like the use of the developer console of the internet browser to debug JavaScript errors or the process of hovering over red dots in the code playground to explore error messages.

<!-- PERHAPS PULL UP DETAILS OF DEBUGGING. -->

In the area of product revision the repeated, solo, incremental changes of the details of implementation of game design patterns indicate a personal appropriation of concepts like game feel and challenge. The experience of debugging appears to be a particular practice evoking certain feelings. Feelings of frustration alternate with elation at solving a tricky bug. As I built proficiency as a facilitator I began to identify different kinds of errors emerging as explored in the previous chapter. The use of code patching often provoked glitch bugs which where actually behaviour did not match intended behaviour. In analysis of interactions with participants when trying to solve coding blockages, I note different strategies in responding to such errors. For some participants I quickly solve them with short explanation to allow them to continue. For other participants who I judge to be receptive I may celebrate the glitch and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that allowed the exploration of more abstract concepts using a concrete example afforded by the mechanics of the game design pattern. The following section provides an example of this kind of interaction and examines the surfacing of computational thinking concepts in particular.

<!-- While the use of debugging tools and processes are often introduced to solve a particular problem in implementing one GDP. The same process is uses to solve issues that crop up while implementing other patterns. Throughout the recordings, some individuals show an evolution of problem solving knowledge and processes in relation to coding through their independent work.
CAN i FIND ANY KEY EXAMPLES OF THIS?
-->






#### Other examples of GDP driving adoption of technical processes

References to such emerging practices driven by GDPs were present in many exchanges during directed playtesting and pair interactions. For example, after Fi gave feedback on the jump speed Mi's game, he continued by sharing a process to redundant space at the edges of design sprite characters.

    NOTE - COVERT TO TABLE
    Fi: for people with background like yours You can use the cramping tool.
    Fi leads Mi to his workstation and involves his father in the process.

    Ma: Show what? What are we doing?
    Fi: On this one it’s like this.
    Mi: Oh that’s good how did you do that?
    Fi: The cramping tool. (laughs nervously)
    Ma: The what?
    Fi: What… Is it cramping? (gestures with hands as scrunching / clutching motion)
    Ma: For doing what? What did we do? I don’t know what we’ve done.
    Fi: People have used the whole block.
    Ma: Oh yeah. We’ve just cropped it. So it’s got no border around it. So you don’t set things off when you get really close to them.
    Mi: Aaaah. I see yes. Cos the corners actually could have. (makes a small square gesture with fingers)
    Ma: In Piskel. You can crop it to the sprite  - cause it take that area too. (gestures – draws a large square with hands – then gestures to the edges). You approach an enemy if you’re close to it, it’ll trigger it.
    Mi: ‘cause, sometimes you think how am I just sitting on this ledge here?
    Ma: And you’re floating?
    Mi: Yeah. Yeah that’s what’s happening. So..
    Ma: So you can put you’re sprite back in again and you can crop it down.

There are many other examples of processes being adopted by participants through the implementation of GDPs including the fluidity of navigation between playing and coding window shown by all younger participants and many adults and the development of keyboard and mouse coordination to facilitate navigation within the code environment and external support resources to facilitate the code patching process.


#### Use of evolving GDP terminology to facilitate working practices - IS THERE ENOUGH HERE FOR A WHOLE SECTION?

**Language which has been introduced facilitator interventions is then modified and used organically through community interaction.**

The following example shows a patchy but evolving use of some of the terminology that has been introduced partly by facilitator interventions and partly emerging organically through community interaction.

As background information on this pair, the mother's focus has been on creating graphics and has expressed pride in this her growing expertise in this area.

The mother wants to export an image from the graphical editing tool and to import this into the game.

    Mi: Right so I don't want this rocket here. I want the rocket to be the yellow thingie.
    Ne – Gold coins.
    Mi - Right so, What are you doing? Do you know what you are doing?
    I want the aliens to be the hazard, the rockets to be the gold coins and the spaceman to be the character.
    Mi: Poop Ping? (alarmed) What are you doing? What's poop ping.
    Where's my spaceman?
    Ne: Wait! What do you want the aliens as?
    Mi: The hazards.
    Mi: Yaaay!
    Mi: And now the rocket thing as the like you know the good thing - the reward.
    Ne: Who wants a rocket for their reward?
    Mi: Because if a spaceman gets to a rocket he can get home. But if he doesn't then the aliens get him.
    Ne: It's a very violent game.
    Mi: What?
    Ne: It's a very violent game.  

The mother develops her proficiency of expressing GDP related concepts and language as this interaction develops. This may be to show her increased level of understanding and participation on overall process after being challenged by daughter about her use of technical language. "Do you even know what export means?". Ne also appears to enjoy using the language and norms of game culture to tease her mother. "Who wants a rocket for their reward?" Here the daughter recognises the GDP of reward after used by her mother but questions the aesthetic choice and its appeal to game players.

In line with conventional schooling approaches, computing education in formal settings has large focus on the acquisition and testing of personal knowledge and skills. However, following Rogoff's interpretation of this personal plane as participatory appropriation [@rogoff_observing_1995-1], knowledge or processes which individuals adopt, reuse and transform fits within this plane. Thus beyond solo activity demonstrating personal knowledge, expressions of personal knowledge or practices when they are shared back into the community activity are also valid here.

This chapters' examples of interaction of the participants shows the development of the effectiveness and confidence in participants personal communication surrounding articulation of characteristics games and vitally the processes involved in their creation. This section explore participants experience of GDPs from a personal focus and in particular an examination of and practices of debugging and product revision. -->

Probably Discussion

The process of being able to map the demonstrations of development of understanding - of ? concrete practices -  can be important for practitioners. Especially true if the learning environment needs to be justified.
In this intervention the justification is partly contextual, coding as a desirable employablabilty skill. In other contexts, the justification may be against more abstract curriculum concepts.

My work on a learning dimensions framework for this intervention was driven by integration with curriculum based learning settings to devise a map - similar to drive of Bevan and colleagues to justify learning happening in science-focused tinkering exhibits in museums [-@bevan_learning_2015; -@petrich_it_2013]

## Cultural Dimension

### GDPs can encourage learners to design for others

**Referring to GDPs (especially during playtesting) can help scaffold the process of imagining the end user experiences.**

As explored previously, playtesing as a regular practice can shift learners to a perspective of designing for others. This section examines how some GDPs  provoked participants to imagine the experience of end users of their game. Game design patterns focused on gameplay rather than code structure focus on recognisable behaviour. Thus in the same way that visually organised code can aid ideation, designing code framework to help participants alter on a noticeable change in game play can foreground key GDPs.

In the starting vignette of the chapter Th and Sh come into conflict over the imagined experience of future players. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. Sh shares _"Must be quite hard to get through that door._" when Sh places the exit door high above a platform. She then continues - _“It’s no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid.”_ The child seems determined to remove all hazards. _"It is for me!"_ the child counters. She may be aware of the implications for game balance but takes pleasure in this destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play (as explored in the previous chapter). This interaction shows the use of terms from GDPs to both explain and negotiate a conflict over the imagined user experience.

Later Th interacts with one of the student helpers and outlines her motivations in design.

    H1: Have you enjoyed making the game?
    Th: Yes
    H1- Has it been a lot of fun
    Th: Yes and I like making it frustrating. that other people find it frustrating!
    ...
    Th: You’ve nearly got to mine. Mine’s very hard to get to.
    H1. Is it?
    Th: You’ll like it when you get to it.
    H 1: How many levels do you have?
    Th: Four. Mine’s the last one. And it’s very fun. Do you want to guess about it?
    H1: Erghm. Is there lots of bikes?
    Th: Yes, guess how many there are?
    H1: Is it the whole screen?
    Th: YES! Laughs
    ...
    H1: I will get it to your level
    Th: You seem to not give up. that’s good
    Th turns away to get a hug from her mother.
    H1: I got to your level
    Th: Good! (laughs)
    Th: It’s a secret, special one. (...) If people tried hard they would get to my level.

Th comments that she wants players to be frustrated when playing the game and that this is a contrast to final level which has only rewards and no hazards. This being a secret, special experience which plays against the norms of platform game design, thus provoking player surprise and fun. She notes the persistence of the student helper who pushes past her frustration to complete the game. Sh remark "If people tried hard they would get to my level" shows her awareness of that not all players will persist in the same way.

<!-- Shifts can be described as shifting between levels of activity if viewing activity through an AT lens that encompasses nested levels of activity systems. -->

<!-- There are different levels of designing for others
One is just to make a playable game experience which by design involves an imagined user experience in the abstract. The example above shows a more playful and direct imagining of the experience of other people in the room a more tangible motivation with a more immediate reward. -->

A common proposal of research on professional and participatory design processes is that that ideation is more productive when informed by a realistic sense of the end user experience. (explored in Lit Review) The examples show different forms of designing for others. One is to imagine a user experience and make a playable game in the abstract which matches the mother's approach. Th's playful imagining of the experience of a more immediate audience of fellow game makers and supporting students appears to provide a tangible motivation with rapid rewards.

**GDPs aid the overall process of design for others by providing discreet and clear goals which are nested in the wider goal of making an engaging game.**

This process involves shifts in perspectives from participants as they engaging with objectives on different scopes of activity. For example, participants may get caught up in a particular design goal on a micro-level, engagement may drive an implementation of a quirky characteristic. When this game is self-tested or playtested, that characteristic may not withstand the shift in perspective to the wider goal of making an engaging game.

### The propagation of use of GDPs through playtesting

**The implementation of particular GDPs by participant pairs or individuals often spread through peer activity.**

NOTE CAN THIS FOCUS ON NON TEMPLATED GDPs?

For example, the work of the child to add 21 levels to their own game served as a way to publicise this possibility. The process was also spread by that child's willingness to help others to add that feature to their game. This shifted dependence on myself as a facilitator, or on the instruction-based support documents. This excerpt shows this more experience child coder Te, agreeing to show another child Ch1 how to add new levels.

    Ch1: Why’s that enemy in every level
    Te: He’s not.
    Ch1: Can you show me how you add more levels on to yours?
    Te: Yeah sure.
    Pause
    Te: I’m just going to have one go of beating this (refering to his own game which he is playtesing). It’s 21 levels in it. So .. Yeeeeah.
    Pause
    Ch1: It’s like parcours in Minecraft but times. It’s like playing the game Wipeout. Have you ever played Wipeout?
    Te: Er not really.
    Ch1: Or seen it?
    Ch1: That’s like my second level.
    Te: Ah so hard (Te fails at a high level on his game and starts to move off)
    Te: (To someone else  calling for attention)  No I’m helping (Ch)..
    _(Te then follows Ch to his workstation to help him implement more levels.)_

When Te moves to Ch's game he playtests it and then looks at the code. He notes that Ch has added a variable for a fourth level but then goes on to demonstrate to to add an array representing the next level, and a conditional statement to select level 4 when level 3 is completed. At Te uses the keyboard completes this work, Ch reads aloud the code which is being typed in by Te.

Exchanges like this allow the propagation of GDPs. The process of playing a game of another and sharing your appreciation of it invites participants to add new patterns to their own game. In this example, the process is very direct with the one asking another to help them directly. It is very likely that Ch has noticed Te helping others add levels to their games and thus this may help him to feel empowered to do the same. The propagation here is emerges from and is completed entirely through peer activity. A different and more common pattern of propagation was that participants notice and comment on a game element or pattern during during playtesting, and then to use supporting resources or facilitator help to implement it. A less frequent pattern involved participants' diligent and deliberate use of supporting resources to identify and implement features without peer influence. Typical examples of propagating patterns include placing hazards in tricky places like a lava pit, the use of moving enemies and changes to jump dynamics.

**New GDPs emerged from existing patterns through peer activity during playtesting**

In addition to the propagation of main game design patterns, sub patterns and related design concepts emerged organically from the community. The concept of safe zone in the game of Ch and Pa arrived as a direct result of after adding a moving enemies GDP, the extensive use of that pattern dominates the game challenge to such an extent that it is essential for players to quickly identify and use 'safe zones'.
DEVELOP

<!-- Playtesting also helped propogate emerging practices. For example, after testing Mi's game In the example above after comments on the jump speed Fi continues.

    Fi: How much jump speed to you have?
    Fi: Your jump speed is massive.
    Fi gives advice about tidying up the sprite outlines.
    Fi: for people with background like yours You can use the “cramping tool””
    Ma and Fi then explain – SEE THEIR RECORDING
    So that the background is clearer.

While Fi has only just been introduced to the ability to "cramp". He is happy and able to share this useful tool with Mi. Theme -->



### GDPs facilitate the use of wider funds of knowledge

**GDPs allow participants to share and explore their home and professional funds of knowledge and practices in the emerging learning community.**  

In the previous chapter, the ability for participants to bring home funds of knowledge into the emerging learning community was explored via the use of graphical assets and game narratives. In the previous example we can see a similar process occur as Te self test his game exposes the dominant game experience of timed jumping.

    Ch: It’s like parcours in Minecraft but timed. It’s like playing the game Wipeout. Have you ever played Wipeout?
    Te: Er not really.
    Ch: Or seen it?

Parcour in Minecraft and Wipe out are both  game experiences whose main mechanic is about judging jumps to landing accurately. Ch makes links to his existing experience of games making comparisons between Te's game, commercial games and his own. In doing so Ch is able to show his knowledge and analysis of gameplay patterns to this community. While his motivation is not clear, one interpretation is that Ch could be making this contribution not only to openly share experience but also as a offering in return for his request for help which he has just made.

#### Problem solving practices as a fund of knowledge (but not really GDP)

- CONSIDER REVISING A LOT - AND LINK THIS TO THE EXTRACT ABOUT - EXTERNAL DOCUMENTATION WHICH FOLLOWS ON.

In the following example home funds of knowledge are utilised not only in terms of home experiences of games but also in terms of design and problem solving practices. Da and Te are working closely as a pair.

Da invites thinking outside of the constraints of the suggested design early in this first session. The following interaction shows a rich interchange where the parent is trying to draw on the game playing experiences to promote innovation in the design of the existing template.

<!--
The following exchange shows how the use of GDPs help participants navigate the professional practice of forking a codebase and the exploration of developer resources. Technically, he has the courage to divert from the existing game paradigm from platform to maze. Practically it brings up issues as many of the dominant game design patterns are different. Thus the first one they identify that of enemy following is not present in the current menu of choices.
-->

THIS IS STRONGLY LINKED WITH IDEATION - PERHAPS MOVE THERE.

    Da: Have you thought about pushing it a bit further and have a different style of game?
    Te: What do you mean?
    Da: Well the previous style of game was a platform (makes shape with hands) game wasn’t it? You went along and there was gravity pushing down (points down). There are other types of games aren’t there?
    Te: Pause. I don’t know what to do thought.
    Da: Well quite but what other games are there? again

Te adopts with this suggestion readily once he understands Da's suggestion. He then approaches Mick with a suggestion.  

    Te: You could have a game where every 15 seconds 10 seconds you could add and enemy to such and such a random number between such and such (holds up hands to indicate parameters). You could block it somewhere.
    Da: So instead of.. instead of the world… the world being sideways. We could have the world being looked down on. (reindicates the change of perspective)
    Te: Hmm. How should I do this then?
    Da: That’s a good question. Shall we ask Mick to see if that would mess things up or not?  
    Te: Mick
    Mick: Hi ya.
    Te: Erm. Thinking about what game to do . I was thinking can we make like a Pac-man game kind of thing (indicates movement of character with hands)
    Da: If we had an on the top game rather than a platform game
    Mick: I think it could work. You could kind of adapt that game by, kind of, removing gravity.
    Da: and see what happens?
    Mick: and see what happens.


LOA FROM COMPUTING PEDAGOGY RELEVANT HERE - WHERE ELSE ARE THEY EXPLORED?

Da expresses his desire to for the pair to try something new by implementing a pattern not in the menu of GDPs provided. Their new choice is a change of perspective which involves a new game pattern of a new movement game mechanic. The specific proposal is to remove a jumping game mechanic and using a 2D top down movement mechanic used in maze and adventure games (e.g. Pac-man and Zelda games).

Toby takes on the role of checking these change of direction with me. He uses a concrete example of a game to indicate the shift of genre and games space structure implied, saying "I was thinking can we make like a pacman game kind of thing". Da is more explicit naming the shift of perspective and genre. Mick takes this to a concrete code level by making reference to a key change of code that would be involved.

The decision to divert from the existing meny of GDPs and genre can be triangulated with interview data from Da on the motivation behind his involvement in volunteering at Coder Dojos.  

PERHAPS DROP THIS QUOTE OR WORK OUT HOW TO BETTER INTEGRATE IT?

    Honestly, it's just it's just my hobby and I love it is the main reason. In fact, it's probably the only reason. If I can, if I can persuade / cajole / trick my kids into being involved at the same time, then that's even better. Personally, I think that's about it. I've always been interested in computers. I love, I love, I love programming. I'm no good at pencils and pens drawing or anything like that. But writing software is the closest I get to a creative outlet. So I just love doing that.  

Given this additional perspective, I interpret Da's influence to divert as a way of embracing a creative challenge and bringing his child along for the ride. However, Da is also aware of potential challenges of straying too far from the template. He does not want to "mess things up".

A BIT ON FORKING ISSUES - TO EXPLORE LATER MOVE BELOW TO DISCUSSION?

<!-- This tension has a parallel to a professional practice of "forking" code-bases in open-source code communities. The practice of forking can involve taking a code base in a new direction and the benefits of adaption may be out-weighed by disadvantages including the friction involved in splitting an existing community and duplication of effort. The parent checking with a Mick a guiding community member about the advantages and disadvantages of a major fork in the code structure mirrors this professional tension. -->

This example shows that while the use of GDP can help support choices within a frame, there is also the ability to break out of that restriction and keep some of the benefits of the shared code base.

<!-- My own positive response to their suggestion was driven partly from knowledge of Da's cultural background a both a professional coding and a volunteer supporting children's coding programmes. While simultaneously checking with other groups that they use the starting template as a base, to avoid overload as previously discussed in design decisions, I encourage this pair to see what happens as a potential learning opportunity. I am conscious that the change of movement may open up different possibilities for new game patterns that this pair may be able to solve. This outweighs the possibility that the pair will get bogged down in complex code problems or structures which may be beyond the capacity of the young person. After all even if they encounter father must solve, the apprentice does not need to understand everything in order to benefit from observing the master at work. -->

## Discussion on the use of game design patterns in the 3M learning design

The majority of this chapter has focused on interpretation of observations of participant interactions. A deeper exploration of concepts is present in the following chapter which synthesises the observations of this study in relation to broader research. The remainder of this chapter begins this process with a closer look at the use of game design patterns as a intermediate design construct to facilitate coding education and at learner agency in relation to the user of GDPs in this data.

### Discussion on the use of design patterns and pattern catalogues - MERGE WITH THE SECTION BELOW

The process of creating a learning design where students were able to choose from a curated set of game design patterns is covered in the design chapter of this thesis. In this section the response of users is explored in relation to other research on this areas.

Firstly the concept of a restricted activity is well trodden ground outlined in many guidelines including Bruner's reducing degrees of freedom [@wood_role_1976]. In a design education intervention working with 11-12 year olds Eriksson and colleagues [@eriksson_using_2019] used a collection of curated patterns to prompt learners to analyse and then propose changes to an existing collaborative game called Stringforce. It is useful to compare the supports and approach of Eriksson's Stringforce study with that of the 3M intervention of this study.

The overall goal of the analysis of GDPs also differ, in the 3M study the principle goal is analysis of the use of GDPs by learners to aid their goals in creating their own games. In Eriksson's study the principle goals to is to address the perceived "challenge how to make results from research work related to this within Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) field easily transferable to future CCI research." [@baykal_using_2019]
The Stringforce study involved learner analysis of games, the ability to change level design via graphical editor and co-design of proposed conceptual changes to existing games. Unlike 3M it did not involved the learners then adding new patterns to games using code.  

One similarity is the number of patterns presented to learners. In this iteration of the study 3M presented 20 patterns in the menu of options and the Stringforce study selected 14. Their selection criteria for patterns to include in co-design stages included the following concerns; concrete patterns were favoured over more abstract ones to aid the learner comprehension, patterns chosen matched the learners' capabilities, patterns that were game mechanics were also prioritised as were pattern suggested by the learners.

 <!-- Using a choice of patterns when compared to instructional tutorials (previously explored in methods chapter)  -->

In the 3M design the process of offering a choice of games patterns emerged to counter a previous open design process of which many learners found too challenging. The patterns emerged chiefly in response to requests from learners and partly from facilitator decision making which broadly matched the criteria of the other study. However, in Eriksson's study the authors selected from an extensive, pre-existing pattern collections [@bjork_patterns_2005].

While their results on the advantages and challenges of patterns use focus principally on the perspective of designers (as a way to frame analysis of the activity and shifting interpretations of pattern interpretations), the participant is also shared. I explore some of the opportunities and challenges they surface addressing learner perspective.  

GDPs served both researchers and participants by _providing a common language_ to clarify first learner expression and researcher's analysis of gameplay experience. Gdps functioned as an _inspirational structured design tool_ Eriksson's study outlines the utility notes teacher observations that GDPs served to stimulate learner imagination and ideation stages. The use of a patterns and their collection as a form _intermediate-level knowledge_ by both researchers and participants is under-explored in this study but builds on related work by two of the authors and is explored in the next part of this chapter.  

In 3M the use of GDPs by participants has been outlined in this chapter. A summary is included in Table 6.x

#### Game design patterns as a intermediate-level construct to facilitate developing coding fluency

**Summary:** Game design patterns provide learners with a suitable vehicle to engage with coding practices partly due to their position between abstract computational concepts and concrete implementations of code structures.

### GDPs used to explore computational, design and systems concepts -->


NOTE - PARTS OF THIS WILL LIVE IN LIT REVIEW.

The term abstraction has varied interpretation even within the field of computer science education [@hazzan_reducing_2002]. Papert and Turkle's [-@papert_epistemological_1990] encourage a of diversity in approaches to teaching coding beyond a formal, abstract approach "that emphasizes control and through structure and planning". Their celebration of concrete coding approaches, including the use of tangible physical and digital objects, and more piecemeal, bricolage approach has influenced the design of popular educational programming software and pedagogy through the constructionist school and maker movements (as explored in the literature review). In a challenge to this article Wilensky [-@wilensky1991abstract] questions the nature of abstract in this context arguing that all objects and concepts are abstract until familiarity makes them more concrete to the user.

Tedre and Denning's [-@tedre_long_2016] review of CT cautions against a too narrow definition of CT that highlights formal abstractions as represented by Wing's take on CT [-@wing_computational_2008]. This is not to argue that Wing's approach to CT is without technical merit [@lodi_computational_2021], rather that its adoption by educational bodies like CAS in the UK and similar bodies internationally has risks. The inclusion of formal CT frameworks in curriculum and formal testing has provoked mechanistic teaching of decontextualised concepts via formal teaching methods to the detriment of hands-on exploration and creation of personally meaningful projects [@resnick_coding_2020].

In teaching computing pedagogy the concept of levels of abstraction can be taught to students to help them undertand the level of abstraction that they are working at  [@statter_teaching_2016; @waite_abstraction_2016; @waite_abstraction_2018-1]. To quickly review LOA, the levels are Problem, Design, Code, Running the Code. And the purpose is, "Levels of abstraction has been interpreted as a hierarchy to enable teachers and learners to describe which level they are working at, rather than as a methodology for programming projects."[@waite_abstraction_2018]

This conception of levels abstraction is also present in the analysis of the different scopes game making activity systems. Through this lens the most abstract activity system is the larger one who's objective, to make an engaging game that tells an environmental story, aligns with the problem level of LOA. The level between abstract and concrete is that of choosing, implementing and testing game design patterns, which aligns with design. The most concrete in this interpretation is then the implementation of different lines of code or creation and migration of digital assets.



#### Potential implications for facilitators and researchers

In professional coding environment and training programmes design patterns, particularly in object-oriented approaches and in the domains HCI are seen as a middle ground between abstract CT concepts and more concrete techniques.

    In order to be useful, patterns must present an abstraction of good practice at a meaningful level of granularity. Formulations that are too abstract will be impractical in real design use; those that are too specific will be difficult to re-use in new scenarios.[@dearden_pattern_2006, p. 20]

Earlier in this chapter the work of Eriksson and colleagues using gameplay design patterns with young people [-@eriksson_using_2019] drew inspiration from the value of design patterns as a form of "intermediate-level concept" as advocated by fellow researchers as a way of sharing results of research [@barendregt_intermediate-level_2018]. Similarly, the implementation GDPs was the identification as a key unit of activity and analysis for this study, the justification being that it was at this level that richest use and development of tools and processes by the emerging community took place.

The observations of this chapter show the advantages of GDP as an intermediate design concept, hovering in the space between too concrete to be repeated and too abstract to be grasped by novice game makers. GDPs create a tangible link between concrete player experience and the affordances of a guided creative process. Learners use of GDP as relatable and flexible constructs that facilitate  communication, sustaining engagement, planning and division of labour. The creation of designed objects using GDPS aid the personal appropriation and the propagation of technical and social processes game making practices.  Previously abstract concepts or processes become concrete through familiarisation via direct use and indirect observations through community participation. In many of the outlined uses of GDPs in chapter we can see processes at play that help bridge shifts in design perspective. Both the GDPs and the sub-actions of the wider activity design become short-cuts which stand in for previously tricky to complete set of actions. Rather than promising the transfer abstract concepts to other domains, we see learners build competency in participation in replicable processes. These processes which aid future iterations of the GDP implementation design cycle. The process of operationalisation of these sets of actions contributes to the creation of an informal, complex networked resource of operations which complement the more visible curated catalogue of GDPs.





Game design patterns or their fragments are used as a form of design short cuts. Examples from the above include, _get an enemy in_ , _animate player_ or _get it in the game_ (when referring to transferring an graphical asset from authoring tool to the coding environment). The advantages of such shortcuts are, as discussed, to help with the prioritisation and ideation processes, to facilitate peer propagation of ideas, and potentially to inform debugging and improvements to increase game playability.


NOTE - SUPPORT NEEDED FOR SOME OF THE BELOW - AND MORE DISCUSSION NEEDED ON CHALLENGE IN GENERAL

There are challenges of the use of these short cuts and at a more general the design choice to lead with a menu of intermediate-level constructs in the form of a menu of GDPs. There may be confusion over use of terms to new comers and these GPD related terms may hide more complex patterns within the name. For example, the shortcuts in Fi and Ma's interaction hides a large amount of problems solving which seems "overwhelming". GDPs can limit the ideation process through an accelerated approach. Also as the menus themselves are not all used by students, and while GDPs do propagate from student to student, which risk further constraints on the process of asking questions about user experience and exploring ideas before committing to implementation.

Despite these challenges, research of data overwhelmingly indicates the positive affect of participants in implementation of GDPs. This is shown particularly in a growing sense of mastery towards technical processes becoming second nature and the resulting ability to share them with family and other peer groups. On a related note, the next section addresses the development and nature of agency in this learning design.

PATCHED IN FROM PREVIOUS SECTION.

As explored in the design chapter, later revisions of the design of supporting materials for each GDP included links to online descriptions of design, systems and computational concepts. Thus, beginning with experience and progressing to analysis in a sway that mirrors reflective professional practice. However analysis of my journal entries show an ongoing reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge.

My concern hinged on the potential disorientation of the learner that imposed shifts of focus may provoke. As learners shift between different stages of creation the object of their activity shifts from the larger goal of making an engaging game to a narrower goal of implementing a game design pattern to narrower still of completing one of several actions to complete the implementation of a GDP. In the language of activity theory the change of objective denotes is a shift in scope of the activity system.

 The advantages of such shortcuts are, as discussed to help with the prioritisation and ideation processes, to facilitate peer propagation of ideas, and potentially to inform debugging and improvements to increase game playability.

 However, there are challenges of the use of such short cuts including;
 - hiding more complex patterns within the name.
 - confusion over use of terms to new comers

 For example the shortcut of a name for a pattern in Fi and Ma's interaction hides a large amount of problems solving which seems "overwhelming" -->

<!-- ### Call back to design practices
As per last chapter but develop in relation to GDPs -->
<!-- However from the novice designers' perspective, there are elements of patterns involved. -->
<!--
**Exploring the grokkable nature of GDPs**

 GDPs if well designed can be accessible in this grokkable way.
The term grok is used here to indicate an embodied, intuitive understanding that mirrors the concept of deep learning. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok

Repeated practice is an important part of this process.

### Discussion on GDPs, emerging processes and learner agency

NOTE - JUST BULLET POINTS FOR NOW  - RELATED CLOSELY TO THE USE OF GDPS - AS THIS NEEDS TO BUILD ON THE WORK OF THE LAST CHAPTER

<!-- This chapter has begun a process of exploration of the nature and evolution of agency in the practices of the participants through the varied use of GDPs.  -->

 <!-- In this final section I continue to explore emerging thoughts on learner agency in my design through the lens of existing research. The theme of conceptions of learner agency in this practice will be expanded upon in the following discussion chapter. -->


**Tensions between facilitating agency and norming practices**

This chapter has explored the use of game design patterns by participants to aid the development of their game making practices. Participants are able to use the affordances of the existing learning design and add their own evolving practice to them as a way of expressing and building agency.

<!-- Examples of this dynamic agency include the use of graphical code structures, asking for peer or facilitator support etc. -->

However as a seeming counterpoint to this growing agency is the norming effects of concepts that gain community currency in playtesting. The repeated attempts by participants to make the jumping mechanic of Mi less frustrating can be seen as a potential drag on the agency or autonomy of Mi as a designer. However this may be a false dichotomy. Such norming practices can be seen from a different perspective. The following chapter begins with a deeper exploration of learner agency in relation to existing research in this domain.

**The freedoms and restrictions of playgrounds**

While the process of direction may be less totally learner-driven approach than the first iteration of the learning design P1, working with a starting menu of game patterns with support still provides challenges to learners and complexity of working processes. Design blockages still occur, and participants have to work with facilitators in depth to overcome issues. There is the possibility to adapt existing patterns, to add new patterns from outside the curated collection or to shift to new game paradigm requiring a different set of patterns altogether.  

In this research, similar metaphors have emerged in the pedagogical and technical process surrounding the concept of playgrounds and gardens. In the previous section the use of a curated set of design patterns can be referred to as a walled garden or sandbox. The process of checking the performance of games is called playtesing. The web-based environment which reduce the complexity of web development and provide community and immediate feedback are named code playgrounds. While some of this language is specific to the creation of games, other terms are also prevalent in non-game coding.

These metaphors invite a connection to play theories concept of as the magic circle. Play theorist outline the value of stepping into a more controlled area of voluntary experimentation where the fear of failure is reduced. Game rules are norms which seed participation in community processes. The playful context of the game's magic circle can facilitate participants to adapt norms and rules to their own playing styles. Through this lens, the interaction of playtesting, code playgrounds and a sandbox of game patterns emerge as a key practices to facilitate and maintain learner agency. The discussion of the next chapter explores the intersection of these elements in more detail.


<!-- For exa In the language of double stimulation, a tension of relative inactivity at times is overcome by invitations to playtest and resulting interaction. -->
<!-- ### Link Paragraph to next chapter

A theme to follow up in the Maps / personal learning chapter is that of picking up on some of the behaviour of participants, especially that of experienced parents, experience either in coding practices of supporting their children. Once identified, how could beneficial interactions be encouraged in the next iteration of design.

Examples include;
- supporting reflection on design and coding concepts / skills.
- navigation / organisational support - use of a physical map.

For example, the use of CT concepts in a framework, listed as part of the initial design pattern card, which could then be discussed, ticked off or otherwise reflected on. -->

## Disregarded or Next Steps Data

We can also compare the patterns and also the frequency of these interactions with a future session later in the year. COULD DO BUT SIDELINE FOR NOW - ADD TO NEXT STAGES? -->
