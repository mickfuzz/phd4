## Introduction to broad context

In this thesis, I explore digital game making as a vehicle to develop to computational fluency and participation in coding community practices.

_Motivations behind game making_: The learning potential of digital game making is explored in depth in a review by Kafai and Burke. This review focuses primarily on the development of game making to support subject knowledge and coding prowess [-@kafai_constructionist_2015].

However, as shown by varied research, the motivations of digital game making and wider making are more diverse, encompassing critical making and empowerment agendas AND MORE.

While this thesis covers practical process of learning to code, it also addresses aspects of game making more to do with the overall expressive value of digital media.

To reflect this, the term computational fluency is used at times as an overall guiding motivation. The term encompasses

    Computational fluency involves not only an understanding of computational concepts and problem-solving strategies, but also the ability to create and express oneself with digital technologies.

    Becoming fluent, whether with writing or coding, helps you to develop your thinking, develop your voice, and develop your identity.


    (Resnick, 2017 & 2018) - not sure which ones.

Resnick's quote comes in a piece creative coding at a crossroads. A critique of formulaic and instruction based computing education.

While the activities of this study take place outside of school, this study echoes this concern. Later in this introduction the mess that is the 2014 Computing curriculum and associated exams have caused with recent reports underlining already growing concerns.

x, y and z from Peter Kemps report on SCARI

Sadly, the concerns mostly echo previous concerns with the 'hardness' of computing education culture which were explored as computing education emerged [Papert].

They are also addressed by other work on inclusion from researchers explored in this and the next chapter which highlights the value of authentic projects which appeal to [Many], end products which incorporate personal creativity [many], and processes which incorporate a building of sense of community participation [many].

In line with this research, this thesis highlights the importance of learning contexts on the creative process in digital making.

The development of agency in the participation in game making communities is of particular interest to me. This interest stems in part from my desire to develop learner agency in my wider work on student project-based approaches in higher education and STEM education.

There is also, when viewing agency from an empowerment perspective agency, a link to my past involvement in grass-roots music and campaigning projects. The next section this dimension through a brief exploration of my personal context.


<!-- New software tools to make games which offer new pedagogical possibilities emerge regularly. Game playing practices and the opportunities provided by participation in wider communities also continue to evolve. For example, casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014]. My study, in part, asks how the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities can be brought into more structured educational environments.    -->




## Personal context and motivation for undertaking this study
<!-- In 1995, as anyed recent graduate and new editor of a fanzine on the fledling electronic music scene centred around the Hulme venues of the Nia centre and New Adri, I was directed to this centre as it had the software Abiword which had the ability to print out rounded text boxes, a feature I thought would look pretty snazzy cut and pasted over over-photocopied backgrounds from 2000AD. No physical place in the UK seemed to better live out the counter-cultural, dystopian, cyberpunk ethic popularised by 2000AD and the author William Gibson. -->


<!-- In the middle of regenerated Hulme on the corner opposite the Birley fields campus is a squat unassuming building called the church of the Ascension. It is notable Apart from being  a site of sanctuary for the political refugee Viraj Mendis in a notable anti-deportation campaign of the 1980s, it was also the site of one of Europe's first electronic village halls, Hulme Community
##  Computing Centre. Here a encouraged me to make a website a music fanzine I edited, giving me a print out on how to write HTML web pages and offering free space asOn 5 July 2024, a draft resit timetable will be shared with Heads of Department and Department Education Leads for review, with any comments to be returned by end of 10 July 2024.  part the projects website. This spirit of peer-learning combined with my desire to share the ethos of the DIY music scene fuelled many years of using the internet to promote unlicensed music events. In 1995, the internet, like Hulme, seemed to be a corporate free space, a space for oddballs, niche enthusiasts and more importantly activists. This period saw increasing alignment with the growth of the internet to link up activities of disparate political and cultural groups around gatherings international finance institution (IFIs). For me this culminated in helping to organise and promote an event for June 18th 1999. Similar carnival-themed events drew on the blue print of reclaim the streets mixing street blockaded by outdoor sound systems. While the site of street party and protests as a chaotic and inspirational environment has been explored [@carmo_reclaim_2012; @jordan_notes_2005]. -->

In the 1990's I used to help organise and promote unlicensed music events and festivals. Email and websites became important tools in this process and I was an enthusiast early adopter. In in the mid-nineties, when I first started publishing websites, the internet seemed to me almost free of corporate messages. It was a space for oddballs, niche enthusiasts and activists. In the 2000's I was involved outreach for environment activism and left-libertarian protests around unaccountable global institutions (WTO, IMF, G8). I used used film screenings and music events for outreach and email lists, websites and wikis for organising. I worked with Undercurrents video activism magasine to digitise their VHS magasine and publish them on the web [@heritage2008video]. Undercurrents became aligned with a broad network of media and internet activists clustered around the Indymedia project [@pickard_united_2006].

There was a broad alignment with the non-hierarchical approach of these activist networks and the decentralised organising principles of the free software and free culture movements [@lessig_free_2004]. The ethos and new uses of technology of these networks and was something that I wanted to share with local organisations. I developed a specialism in internet and media creation training and community development as paid activity to support my environmental and migrant-rights activism.

<!-- I set up and ran three media centres from the period 2005 to 2009. The first at an Manchester city centre social centre and cafe, another for Community Arts Northwest and a third for People's Voice Media in Salford. I documented and promoted low-cost media and web production processes in as a member of with FLOSS Manuals and Transmission international networks. As part of this process I co-wrote A Open Web which celebrated the opportunities of the decentralised, even playing field provided by open source web technology and processes. -->



<!-- In 2001 later after working as a teacher, and being immersed in the party and protest scene I returned to Manchester and found a home in the Redbricks estate. Since 1999 local residents had rented a pre broadband T2 internet collection and used linux servers and snaking, self-made  network cables across roads, through roof spaces, to share this connection for affordable prices. Pete helped set up our connection for a home office for a new internet project called Beyond TV which was a pre-YouTube internet sharing site off shoot of the Undercurrent VHS magasine video activist project [^4].   -->

<!-- The reality that the police and wider authorities had just been letting direct actions happen and even instigating some of them was stark. -->



In 2011, it was revealed that several activist groups I had been involved with were infiltrated by an undercover police officer (Mark Kennedy / Stone)[^1]. My role in outreach for this movement became very uncomfortable as it became clear to extent to which participation in this movement came with hidden risks. Our attempts to create systemic change were being countered with response from the state who were far better resourced than we were. The momentum of this movement had been in part by driven by new uses of technology and grass-roots organising processes.  

Our attempts to create systemic change were being countered with response from the state who were far better resourced than we were. The momentum of this movement had been in part by driven by new uses of technology and grass-roots organising processes. However, the growth of the open web as a means for more egalitarian and non-corporate means of publishing was also attacked. A process exemplified by the embrace, extend & extinguish [^3] tactic. Concurrently, the open posting Indymedia network suffered from extensive posting of misinformation and ad-hominem attacks from suspicious sources, an early example of state-sponsored troll farms targetting community activism on social media [jensen_russian_2018].   

<!-- Jensen, Michael (September 24, 2018). "Russian Trolls and Fake News: Information or Identity Logics?". Journal of International Affairs. 71 (1.5): 115–124. -->

<!-- Project-based community and communications felt rewarding but the legs of community-based adult education were being cut off by the coalition government. -->
<!-- My response was to shift focus towards community work and training and documentation work with international networks and then eventually to informal learning of media creation with young people and families. While this move was a retreat from other domains in part driven by painful experiences outlined above, my shift of interest towards young people and family was a positive and strategic shift to align with my new role as a university tutor in education and as a new parent. -->

<!-- There are positive elements to this otherwise sad story. My experiences have helped focus my interests on how change can happen and happen quickly when new opportunities become available to a community eager to use them. They also caution against unrealistic expectations of systemic change when faced with opponents with deep pockets and extensive resources. I would like to communicate a pragmatic approach of finding the limits of your agency, strategically pushing against them, and cautiously observing what happens. An informed activism built on a critical view of the nature of the system in question. -->

In response to growing discomfort around involvement in political and environmental activism, and also to pay the bills, I shifted focus towards undertaking community development and working with FLOSS Manuals where I wrote and promoted documentation and online learning resources media creation and and collaborative processes using Free Software. I documented and promoted low-cost media and web production processes and co-wrote A Open Web a book which celebrated the opportunities of the decentralised, even playing field provided by open source web technology and processes. This work gave me access to diverse international networks whose work was informed by participatory and egalitarian methods. A key network was the Mozilla community where I created documentation, workshops guides and other learning resources with networks of informal educators. This avenue offered a reconnection to the discussing the politics of independent communications in line with an empowerment agenda.


**Training to teach in formal education**

I was attracted to the rhetoric leading up to the launch of a new UK computing curriculum in 2015 promised the ability to undertake computing and multi-media project production within the classroom and taught exam work [@livingstone2010next]. I undertook a masters in Computing and then an PGCE in teaching Computing.

As part of my PGCE dissertation I designed and delivered a pilot scheme to teach javascript in playful ways. I used Mozilla's webmaker tools and adapted soem of their open leadership processes. In addition to he dissertation findings [^2], the learning materials were made available as an OER as part of Mozilla's online teaching resources= Learn / Teach thew web.

While I was drawn to the possibilities offered by a new technologies and the reality of schools that I taught in working within the constraints of the curriculum, exams and competing pressures for time worked together to prevent the kind of authentic activities that first attracted me. Barriers to undertaking practical PBL projects are explored in the Literature Review in Chapter 2 of this thesis.

A role Manchester Met University role doing community partnerships as part of their EdLab project [^4] did provide opportunities to pursue
creative project based approaches to education and incorporate teaching technology to a suitable age range as part of the projects outreach work.

### Transition

My engage with game creation via coding stemmed a consultation with home educators via EdLab partnership work. To align with the interests of parents and children at the consultation asked if we could lead activities which drew on interest in games like Minecraft to start to do computer coding. As I began to investigate games as a medium to explore and create as a playful educational experience, I saw possible parallels to previous work.

Building fluency of media production and personal expression aligns with motivation of empowerment and equality of access to digital participatory culture mirroring my experience with DIY music events and protest culture.

At this point I applied to undertake a PhD with Education and Social Research Institute of Manchester Metropolitan University (ESRI) with game making with families as the topic for activity.

Key characteristics, involve the process of making games via coputer coding. together as a family. As well as the process of learning a useful technical skill, I was also interested the mutual process of designing an inclusive learning design that drew on participants interests. I wanted to use a project based approach which avoided instruction and allowed participants to follow diverse paths and be part of a slightly chaotic but productive learning community.

Because previous experience had made me wary of previous experience of embracing technology opportunities and suffering from unintended consequences I was keen to choose an approach which allowed for a careful examination of context and motivations.  

In this introductory chapter, I briefly outline the use of AT and agency and methodology approaches. I also outline contextual factors of some of the areas of activity where the learning approach studied may be relevant.


## Academic and Conceptual Contexts

### The complex role of agency in this thesis

My personal context illustrates several examples of the structure and agency debate [@bazerman_structure_2003]. A tangential but important motivation is to make sense of this experience in philosophical terms.

Thus RQ3 of this thesis addresses the process of developing agency within a community. The process of undertaking a PhD gave me a chance to investigate my driving motivations previous projects in a new context and setting. However, while I had a sense of what success felt like in creative media project work, I lacked clear language to communicate this either in the academic or practice based settings. Thus, one of my objectives was to be able to better understand the driving forces of my involvement in education aspects of community in terms of the range of training and community projects that I had been involved with.

There was a messiness and a responsiveness that I wanted to capture and celebrate, and a dedication to real-life projects and working with the interests of participants. As such I began to search for a relevant theoretical framework and terminology to achieve this exploration in academic terms.

The messiness of approach resonated with Papert and Turkle's celebration of bricolage approaches and corresponding rejection of the primacy of abstract approaches to learning computing. This ethos had been developed into a school of pedagogy named Constructionism which continues to be popular in computing education in particular through the work or MIT labs.  These are elements of pedagogy that are explored in Chapter 2.

Constructionism valuing of project work was of potential interest to me. In addition the school's work on Computational Fluency as a counterpoint to Computational Thinking allowed for concepts of identity exploration and self-expression [].

However, constructionism seemed lacking in theoretical underpinning allowing a spanning of different domains.

Instead AT offers a rich language to explore the kind of empowerment and limits to it in a wider contextual sense.

It also provided a diversity of concept to explore a complex and dynamic picture of participant agency.

This complexity  is important to this thesis as it allows a full exploration of contextual factors at play, especially initial and emerging barriers to participation to undertaking project work.

The link with this thesis here is that the process of community change can be rapid and transformational and that greater understanding of the processes involved are of value. Thus, a wider goal is the research is to reflect on experiences of developing agency. While agency and autonomy have disputed, often inter-related definitions [@huang_autonomy_2013; @matusov_mapping_2016]. This study uses the following terms which can help locate RQ3 more precisely: instrumental agency, relational agency and authorial agency.

My personal context is an example that changes happening within one system may cause a reaction from wider system elements and actors, which pushes back to reverse the initial changes. My story illustrates the 'risky' process of collective agency working on objectives that may run away to involve unforeseen outcomes [@edwards2009systemic, p. 200]. On a personal level, I want to transcend feelings of regret associated with not being wary enough of unintended effects of embracing possibilities for social change offered new technologies.



 <!-- To address this Summary of what is in Ch.3 -->

<!-- While RQ3 is necessarily limited in the extent it directly addresses forms of agency. The surfacing of my conflicted understandings of the experimental change need to acknowledged here for context as they do emerge in the way I locate the findings in relation to other research in later chapters. -->


### Sketchy pedagogies

The messiness and sketchiness of my preferred  learning experience were also somehow important for me to preserve and to investigate as part of this study. This is present in the mutually evolving nature of the methodology of the study, as represented in design based learning.  

The process of launching into the unknown with project involving a group of people hoping to collectively make some kind of progress towards a sketchy goal was something familiar to me but under-explored.  Dave Gray's Gamestorming resource [gray_gamestorming_2010] (which became a guiding principle of EdLab project work) outlined a principle of fuzzy goals adapted from Blackwell's work [blackwell_radical_2009]

The process aligns with mutuality of design work and acknowledgement that while the process can seem a bit sketchy the results which incorporate ideas from diverse participants, also build a collective understanding of the problem area among participants which is as valuable as the proposed solution. It can also avoid unforeseen consequences by a more rapid adjustment in the course of a project.

In addition to AT as a theoretical framework, recent work on transformative agency within the wider school of socio cultural approaches has particular promise to aid this study.

Two years after starting my studies, a special issue of Mind and Culture journal explored young people, digital mediation, and transformative agency [@kajamaa_young_2019].

<!-- I also problematise educational projects beyond the sometimes superficial take on educational project in schools with wider concepts derived from the socio cultural tradition. -->

<!-- This process links back to my own feelings of entrapment, powerlessness and guilt after being involved with wider activist movements and projects. I want to be able to give detailed tools of critically analysis that do not paralyse but also do not unthinkingly evangelise social change in ways which may be unsafe or unrealistic. -->






### Overview and motivations of game making (for learning) - and who should read this thesis

<!-- The title of Kafai and Burke's book "Connected Gaming: What Making Video Games Can Teach Us about Learning and Literacy" [@kafai_connected_2016]  indicates their desire to mirror Gee's work around the importance of context and community the process of game making. The structure of the book revolves around studying personal, social and cultural element of game making.  -->

**Who should read this thesis?**

Given the overall direction of this thesis, who is the intended audience? While the participants are home educators, other areas of education may benefit from the answers to these questions.

- parents and families
- teachers
- Researchers in computing education
- informal educators
- In addition my experience of the process, research and generative, action research   

My experience of having the rug pulled out from underneath me after volunteering my time and energy in various projects motivates me to examine the characteristics streams of activity carefully. Thus the following analysis of the sites of interest cover not only educational programs but based on underlying funding and the motivations of funders.

Thus proposed motivations for supporting coding and game making are analysed alongside the financial models which support activities. I am guided by the work of Vossoughi and colleagues  [@vossoughi_making_2016] whose see critique of maker movement shows the potentially negative impact of the positivist, industry-focused STEM agenda on inclusive practice.

The following sections therefore explore diverse motivations for learning to code specifically via game making or an informal making culture.




- Learning coding and related digital skills to progress to join the commercial games industry
- Getting more people to take Computing qualifications, a motivation which aligns with the concept of feeding the STEM pipeline in to science industries
- Parents motivations to develop individual useful skills in young peoples.
- Game making for intrinsic pleasure of making games or similar projects that are celebrated
- for empowerment of individual and health of society as consumers of technology

### Defining and conceptualising - formal, home and third space contexts - SUMMARISE /  COMPRESS

**on Informal Education Pedagogies**

To assess the wider use of professional frameworks of concepts, it is potential valuable to test them in the context of wider theories of community and informal  learning.

Informal education has the potential to offer less barriers to authorial agency which are engendered by factors such as curricular constraints, practical classroom factors and school behaviour norms.

**Defining Informal Education**
Definitions of informal education are complex and beyond the remit of this literature review. Informal here is not just about a school or non-school environment [@erstad_identity_2012].

Gerber define formal learning as that which happens in school and informal learning as that outside of school [@gerber_development_2001],
Sefton-Green [@sefton-green_literature_2004] complicates this view, noting that2 informal learning can take place in formal settings and vice-versa.

Others writers [@eshach_bridging_2007, p. 173; @werquin_recognition_2009]  describe learning happens outside of formal institution and where there is little instruction but the learner experience is carefully planned using the term 'non-formal' in contrast to both formal and unstructured/informal learning.

### Summary of Conceptual Context

REVISE THIS A LOT - RETHINK

New technology can provide communities with tools to leverage new opportunities in a way which gives participants greater agency.

Community-based approaches to learning can facilitate this process. The process of learn through undertaking creative media projects is explored in existing PBL literature but more work is needed which share effective practice.

While the kind of learning explored in this study may not traditionally be thought of as an activist project, I find synergies between activist conceptions of education and learning and my wider concerns in a modest but achievable way. Specifically as a desire to move beyond curricular and technical concepts of computational thinking to wider concerns based on empowerment [@lee_none_2016].   

CHAT is optimistic but realistic in the focus on the possibility of change.

However, I am wary to celebrate this uncritically given my recent experiences of unintended consequences of change. This applies even in a computing teaching context.  For while as a Computer teacher candidate I was drawn to the possibilities offered by a new technologies and the shifts in computer pedagogy, school settings faced constraints of the curriculum, exams and time related pressures which threaten to prevent the kind of authentic project based work. I want to be able to give detailed tools of critically analysis that do not paralyse but also do not unthinkingly evangelise social change in ways which may be unsafe or unrealistic.

This study, in part, explores ways in which how the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities can be brought into more structured educational environments.

RQ2 explores this with a focus on the use of game design patterns, a concept used in both professional and enthusiast settings.

## Game making and coding and in schools and formal education



The most prominent learning objective of making games in educational setting is to develop _coding and computing skills_. There are extensive studies on _game making to learn other subjects_ including maths, biology and chemistry but diverse examples exist. Game making can also develop social skills, self-reflection, cultural awareness and a range of technical abilities that allow participation in information society.

They are also a powerful vehicle for exploring issues involving race, sex, social issues [@tekinbas_quest_2010].

While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research.


The context of many studies of game making to learning either computer science or other subject knowledge in curricular for the most part happens in a school or after school environment.




### Coding and Computing as a School Subject in the UK

The influential report "Next Gen: Transforming the UK into the world’s leading talent hub for the video games and visual effects industries" was focused on providing the UK games and animation industry with the talent needed to succeed [@livingstone_next_2011]. The top recommendations were to include computer science in core curriculum, introduce a new Computing GCSE (a general exam for 16 year olds before they progress to more specialised study) exam, offer bursaries for computing teachers and to implement well-supported use of games and visual animation in the school curriculum as a way to attract more young people to the subject.

- New curriculum
- bursaries
- CPD
- CAS and community responses
- tapping into the enthusiast maker culture

**Finance models for promoting Computing in Schools**

STEM Learning NCCE - teachcomputing.org - How did this develop?  

Reduction in grass roots responses. And less of a focus on directly teaching pedagogy. More meta in approaches.

CAS are supported by BCS and direct help from gov? The grass roots resource creation .

Raspberry Pi foundation have incorporated previously independent organisations Code Club and Coder Dojo and Raspberry Jam which mobilised volunteers to devliver a grass-roots enthusiast events.

Financial elements in general, lack of specialist funding addressed by training CPD funding for schools.
But the effectiveness of this  is limited in teh following ways. Time, enthusiasm,  

**Games in Schools**

The After the Reboot report [@waite_pedagogy_2017], returned to the subject of game making as a way of increasing engagement in the process of coding. The review highlighted several areas of promise which needed more research: using games for engagement, use of design patterns - a term explored later in this chapter - and the involvement of girls in coding and social and cultural aspects of coding. The "After the Reboot" report also contained concerning observations. The report found that girls, ethnic minorities, and students of lower socio-economic status were all less likely to take computing as a subject at GCSE level. Game making aligns well with the principles of inclusive practices and project-based learning (PBL). It provides: learner choice in projects which increases motivation; authentic and shareable project outcomes to encourage peer feedback and reflection;  iterative projects work supporting student mastery; and challenging goals and guidance in goal setting aiding self-regulation in learners.


<!-- The benefits of game making aligns with those of wider creative computing projects. There has been extensive publication on computing education and techniques aimed to support teachers often new to the subject. These include a new website with materials, including quick guides and writing around a set of 12 computing principles.
A lot of this literature is aimed at helping teachers in a classroom context and with a focus of explaining and exploring computing context.
MORE ON THIS - OTHER TIPS FROM NCCE AND LINKS TO RESOURCES.
BUT NOT TOO MUCH
While projects are mentioned as a principle that allows learners to deepen their understanding on computing concepts by putting them into practice. There is less on specifics of how teachers can support project work or indeed how to best develop resources to support project work in schools. -->
<!-- One of the recommended strategies is a Game Jam which focuses on real life issues.

## Context of game making and wider digital making and culture home and informal settings

The context of informal communities is important to situate in summary.

Making games that will be played by audience of friends and family and using tools used beyond the scope of education, professional communities.  


In this study the focus on historical and cultural artefacts and practices brought by Rogoff, and in particular the concept of guided participation, originated in non-school settings, is helpful.   

<!-- However, the concept has been used to analyse participation in non-formal and formal settings.
The following studies are relevant:

- guided participation framed in media literacy @aarsand_appropriation_2016. -->




### On Gaming as a home and informal culture

The work of Livingstone is foundational in the area of home learning of digital technologies[@livingstone_digital_2018].

Research exploring home game playing and digital activity uncovers material that families may bring into a non-formal game making process.

One of the reasons that I was interested to shift to game making was the potential that seemed to be present for intergenerational work based around retro gaming based on its place in public memory [@heineman_public_nodate]. The place in public memory of retro games is complex but for older participants, the effect of nostalgia is significant.

What era and technologies constitute retro games can be disputed, however for this study I use a definition of early arcade games from the 1970s and early 1980s and early generation of home consoles Atari 2600, Nes, Snes and Megadrive before the advent of 3D graphics.

Retro games have a particular aesthetic driven by graphical limitations and the simplified game mechanics which are
due to the limited capabilities of the hardware and storage space involved.

### Home making and consuming of media


Messing around and affinity groups. Ito's work on  and naturalistic studies of digital use and creativity in the home including the value of informal playing around [@ito_connected_2013-1; @ito_hanging_2010], and Gee and the process of tapping into affinity groups and affinity spaces [@gee_what_2004].  Gee's (2004b) work on games and associated culture as learning experiences is founded on his understanding of how the engender a shared discourse and emerging identities .

In addition, maker culture more generally is relevant due to the alignment with tinkering as educational practice in stem education, supported by family involvement and brokering of experiences. The details of tinkering as a pedagogical practice are explored in more detail in the literature review of this thesis.


Casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014].


Building on the concept of participatory culture [@jenkins_confronting_2009], where x and y, there are several streams of activity that are important to reference as foundational context for this study.



### Context of Home Education and family learning

NOTE SEE THIS SUMMARY - WHICH MUST BE IN HERE SOMEWHERE TOO - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1grMat_sXRLdlRSDtR17Lyxf1OAg3ZpOxTWfnDZ3kkIU/edit



The move to family learning as a context suited the trajectory of my interests and the opportunities available as part of University context.

Many professional programmers began with support provided by family.

Barron and Livingstone have outlined the advantages and processes involved in family involvement of technology use and learning in the home. There is clearly an inequality of access to these well paid profession that the development of the computing curriculum and the skills based and creative process focus that was part of the initial narrative is laudable the aims of equality.

However the practical and and cultural difficulties of undertaking a project-based approach withing the curriculum are significant. Factors of difficulties associated with technology projects compound difficulties.

In this research I made the decisions not to focus on the adaptation  of a  informal club approach to the restrictions of in-school classes but rather instead to embrace key elements of it and to explore processes in situ. While the context of home education is not a core to the goals of this research it is important to situate this study accurately.

**Outline of the home eduction context of this study:** The processes and motivations driving of home education are varied [@fensham-smith_invisible_2021]. Classic ideas of reasons for HE include pedagogy and ideology [@galen_home_1991] [@rothermel_can_2003], and often both. My involvement with home ed networks stemmed from University outreach work. In the following section I draw on relevant research to identify characteristics and motivations of the networks and families that I tapped into.

- Unschooling, Holt, drawing out interests of children in everyday activities and facilitating learning around that [@gray_challenges_2013]
- Webs of learning Illich - home ed families active in identifying networks to tap into [@doroudi_relevance_2023] has a relevance with social networking groups and email lists used by home educators to share and align activities.





## Game making and maker culture in non-formal learning contexts and third spaces


### Physical spaces which suit non-formal approaches

Much research on game making focused on non-class room settings.

For example Papert's work

Digital learning in IILP (GLAM settings) is fertile [@degner_digital_2022; @schwan_understanding_2014]



### Funds of knowledge and third space


The concept of funds of knowledge (FoK) emerged from research within United States Latino communities. FoK refers to knowledge that household members have gained as part of their lived experience and social practices [@moll_funds_1992].

In the original study home visits were carried out to better inform design of after-school activities.

However there limits to this approach, including only some families were visited, and adult focused nature of process [@rajala_utopian_2023].  

The term addresses the use of knowledge and skills from participation in activities outside school that teachers can build on to help classroom work and to support the motivation of learners. Researchers found that Latino home cultures, skills and traditions were hardly visible in mainstream school cultures. This resulted in a form of deficit thinking about the performance of these communities [@moll_funds_1992].

### Third spaces and the context of this study

PERHAPS THIS IS METHODOLOGY? MOVE?

The concept of third space is helpful in the context of this study in particular as a space between home life and formal education.

It also is rooted in a sociocultural understanding of learning that is challenging to traditional classroom environments.

### Game making as a fund of knowledge

Research by the UK National Literacy Trust [-@picton_video_2020] of 11-16 year olds found that 96% percent of boys and 65.2% of girls play video games. This study shows that while there remains a disparity between genders, game playing is still very widespread and young people are unlikely to be part of a household where no games are played.

Game making allows children to draw on funds of knowledge in various ways, perhaps in the choice of the kind of game that is to be made, in the setting or subject matter or the style and aesthetics of audio and visual elements of the game.

Teachers can also draw out attitudes and knowledge of game cultures and bring them into the learning environment in an inclusive way. In addition, knowledge of game design conventions can be used by teachers to exemplify coding concepts. For example, consider conditional coding constructs. If Pac-Man touches a ghost, then a player life is lost. Such structures are described as a game design patterns. Werner and colleagues [-@denner_using_2014] found that the use of design patterns and game mechanics when teaching novice coders can increase accessibility for learners due the concrete and relatable approach.


#### Play circles and MOE as a third space

The concept arose in research of this PhD, however it resonated with my past work on forum theatre, art activism and performant art.

A foundation of link between between play theory, MOE and third space theory.

A detailed analysis is beyond remit of this review but broad alignments include:
- use of concept of a new creative space for all participants
- use of mediated strategies to reduce learner stress
- ability to bring self identify to share in a scaffolded and protected way



### Work in non-formal settings drawing on home interests

The work aligns with STEM work on tinkering which mobilises home interests in non-formal settings.

The practices of code patching and remixing are authentic skills used by professional coders who find and combine existing code libraries rather than coding everything from scratch.



### Mozilla - Teach the Web as context and community

A Mozilla white paper [@mozilla_foundation_webmaker_2014] outlines the power of exploring web technology as an empowering activity.

In 2011 I co-wrote an open web collaboratively with other authors as part of a collaborative writing process called Book Sprint (model on code sprints and other corroborative  processes). One of the co-writer Michelle Thorne went on to work with Mozilla as part of their teach the web and web literacy programme. One of her posts is a good illustration of the kinds of activities drawing on home interests to explore authentic web technologies, and some of the digital literacy elements needed to be an effective citizen of the web. https://michellethorne.cc/2015/03/clubs-web-literacy-basics-curriculum/

The tools created by Mozilla to investigate and to remix HTML pages scaffolded the experiences of new learners and paralleled my own early experiences of self-expression through hacking a new technology.

Like Michelle, my path had shifted towards a younger audience.  

As part of my PGCE studies I developed some teaching materials for the Mozilla Foundation as part of the Teach the Web programme. I write a course called Quacking Javascript. My report on the underlying pedagogical approach outlines the following possibilities; playful approach, use of online games, use of popular culture references to increase engagement [@chesterman_webmaking_2015].

My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics and Scratch.


 <!-- This programme introduced a broad set of competencies name Web Literacies including; digital literacy
- web literacy - narrower
- webmaker - and more specific affordances of key web based coding and exploring tools -->


### Authentic web technology & Code playgrounds
<!-- Javascript is an authentic language, core the web. Phaser is a professional and enthusiast framework.  -->

<!-- Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals. -->


<!-- Aligning with the activities of Nicola Whitton exploring the rules and components of games in a playful way. -->

Later in this thesis I problematise the use of the work authentic in learning [@lee_none_2016].

In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity. The motivation was to align to authentic web technology due to my previous experience. The reason for working with code this authentic bears exploration. Characteristics of broader dimensions of authenticity of tools and processes in learning environments are explored in the literature review. A brief summary being: similarity to workplace settings; facilitating activity which serves a need of participants; an ability to showcased resulting work to an audience [@shaffer_thick_1999; @warr_bridging_2020]. While my choice of open source digital tools allowed for a high level of aligning with professional practices, it was also potentially complex in terms of use of tools. In part my motivation for choice of code language (Javascript, Phaser) was driven by desire to align with common workplace practices and to be potentially extensible for future student-led web projects.

#### Code playgrounds - TOO SPECIFIC? MOVE OR SUMMARISE AND MERGE UP

Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals. In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity and thus an ability . My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics.

MOVE TO LR.
The process of running web code can be complicated by setting up a server environment locally to test and then finding a live webserver and the complexity of transferring files to the server via FTP/SSH processes. . Code playground allow users to circumvent such problems. While originally designed more for problem solving, a service more recent code playgrounds provide is to act as a more permanent host for web projects.  

In their brand style and selected  picks of projects, many code playgrounds celebrate and encourage a playful spirit of creativity and sharing.

<!-- NOTE  - I loved FTP and feel nostalgic? perhaps rfer back to that in conclusion? -->

<!-- DROPPED -  There are strong parallels in this presentation to that Scratch community and to the sharing ethos integral to the maker-movement (explored in Lit Review). The interplay between play and work via shared experimentation is developed further in a later discussion chapter. -->

<!-- #### Other online asset creation tools

There are other ways to create assets online. Piskel is a pixel graphics editor, audio creation of assets. These tools are provided by a mix of enthusiast coders and communities of game makers. ### Mozilla, Webmaking and code playgrounds

#### Phaser.js

While the Webmaker program was discontinued and the end of a funding cycle, ongoing core work of Mozilla to provide resources for webdevelopers. One strand of this is game development using javascript  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games

Mozilla chose phaser as a javascript library/ framework (see Glossary). Phaser is a javascript framework embedded in html page. Unlike many game making tools this tools set can be extended to other kinds of projects and is a professional and foundational toolset used to build the majority of websites and many phone applications.

#### Summary of authenticity- COMMENT OR MOVE

Javascript as coding language, Phaser as a game making framework and Glitch as a code environment, are highly authentic and used by both professional coders and enthusiasts alike. -->




## Review of relevant barriers to participating in coding practices emerging in the literature

<!-- NOTE - THIS IS ALSO IN THE DESIGN CHAPTER
CHOOSE CAREFULLY WHERE TO PUT THE RESULTS. -->


This section draws on concepts of the introductory section to review existing research on digital making to identify barriers to participation in digital making and in particular coding practices.


Here, the term barrier is used in a general way. In the next chapter it will be examined with greater criticality.

<!-- NOTE: there is overlap here with contextual factors in the introduction and with the new direction of chapter 4 - probably move a lot of this.  

This section then which summarises existing research in this area needs a clear and different focus.
-->



##  Barriers

### Technical Barriers -  Difficulties in learning to program

Summary here [@gomes2007learning] [@joao_cross-analysis_2019]. and here

    <!-- Through a literature review on this topic, we aim to organize and   systematize the main difficulties into four dimensions of analysis: (i) subject and complexity of languages; (ii) technologies and applications; (iii) teachers and teaching methodologies; and (iv) pupils’ skills[@joao_cross-analysis_2019] -->

In particular, the dilemma between more authentic languages and block based approaches [@joao_cross-analysis_2019].

More literature which examines the complexity of language and development environments should be found here.

Complexity of syntax and problem of leading with syntax [@gomes2007learning]

Issues of needing levels of abstraction in learning programming [@gomes2007learning].


*Specialist coding tools and computational kits*

There may software and hardware kits aimed at novice coders and in particular younger audience [@yu_survey_2018].

This section briefly summarises some of the adaptation in particular, that software has undergone to adapt to this audience.

Much work has been taken out by MIT family developing Papert's ideas on constructionism in tool use

 - Block coding vs text coding, syntax
 - Design principles for game making tools, [@kafai_connected_2016; @resnick_reflections_2005] ()
 - Barriers in using support material for code examples- mapping, understanding, [@wang_novices_2021]


Scratch and GSM merit particular examination as mini-case studies. The  

- Scratch and community element.
- Remix as a feature: [@amanullah_evaluating_2019]
- Online log in
- library of assets to speed up creation
- In built asset authoring tools.

Game star Mechanic added quest ability, and a narrative set in a steam punk aesthetic. Of interest to this study are the motivational use of narrative, and accompanying resources which help analysis of game design patterns and systems based challenges.

NOTE - referenced in design chapter - the alignment with the use of code playground and template.


Computing syntax
Lack of knowledge of what to design..
 which they call “sandbox games,” that integrates the worlds"




### Cultural / Identity barriers to participation in ...

**Barriers to participation**

Develop from introduction, move to a overview of literature which addresses  barriers in participation in coding communities from literature.

The focus of this review is to identify broad streams and currents in research.


#### Barrier - Identity and computer cultures

Early work from Papert and Turkle addresses cultural barriers to computing culture [-@papert_epistemological_1990]. The distinction between hard and soft approaches to learning is explored particularly in studies refuting conceptions that there is a right way to do computer coding. In this context, the hard approach infers a top-down perspective, highlighting advance planning and logical deconstruction of large problems. Papert and Turkle identify the privileging of abstract thinking over concrete approaches in classroom teaching a tendency which is mirrored by recent conceptions and advancement of computational thinking as teaching ideology [@wing_computational_2008].

Paper and Turkle locate different, softer but equally effective coding strategies. Soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner-directed connection with the materials or digital artefacts involved. The learner is presented as adapting a familiar set of concepts and processes to new situations and challenges as they arise as a 'tinker' might use well worn tools to skilfully bodge a repair job [@papert_childrens_1993, p. 143].

Kafai and Peppler also address the issues of gender identities and game design [@kafai_beyond_2014] asking how to create new communities and learning environments which align with values of participants rather than aiming to break into existing ones. They propose that we ask not *How can we bring girls into the game making clubhouse* but rather *How can we build new clubhouses suitable for the interests of girls*. Two of the playful elements they suggest are textiles related technology and the promotion of more collaborative online spaces as opposed to technology competitions.

<!-- #### Barrier - Unfamiliarity with design process due to instruction based schooling systems

When faced with choice learners are sometimes unsure how to start creating.
Design scaffolds have been created to support this. -->




### Barrier - unfamiliarity with support practices

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].




 <!-- Low floors: a tool that is intuitive enough to allow new users to acclimate to it gradually and with a degree of confidence.
 High ceilings: a tool that also allows more experienced users to create constructs (in this case, video games) that can grow increasingly complex and nuanced as one’s own proficiency increases.
 Wide walls: a tool that—in addition to low floors and high ceilings—allows its users to create a wide range a constructs, letting users tap into elements of personal experience as well as popular culture to design and develop something entirely unique and representative of their own interests and backgrounds.
 We added a fourth principle to emphasize the equally important social dimension of construction tools:11

 Open windows: a tool to facilitate the sharing of digital media. The creation of digital communities represents the new frontier in terms of making computer programming a more accessible skill for youths. -->



### Outlining  cultural barriers / aspects of game making



The following studies are explored future in LR. Here I surface cultural barriers experienced by participants.


**Gender  related identities**
- Important to caution against gender stereo-typing and identity in relation to computers [@pelletier_gaming_2008]
- study by Fisher and Jenson critically explored diverse themes through a summer game making programme 2017). Emerging issues included pinkification, marginalisation and exclusions of women from game cultures, sexualisation and harassment.

<!-- were explored by Pelletier as part of the Making Games project using the Mission Maker software 2008). Data was recorded from two UK schools in an 18 month after school programme. Pelletier draws on the work of Butler 1988) to caution against overdue influence of a set conception of gender or cultural stereotypes, seeing gender as a personal and flexible product of continuing activities and interactions. In this study, she explored the promise of the process of game design and the analysis of gaming habits as a platform and set of tools for young participants to explore and construct their gender identity over time. This area is a rich seam to explore and a more recent study by Fisher and Jenson critically explored diverse themes through a summer game making programme 2017). Emerging issues included pinkification, marginalisation and exclusions of women from game cultures, sexualisation and harassment. -->


**Race related identities**

In study by Thayter and Ko [@thayer_barriers_2017] the work of Margolis et al is analysed using concepts from communities of practice, type of barriers, and personal obstacles [@margolis_stuck_2008;]

    Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race and Computing by Margolis, Estrella, et al. [ 12] examined the racial gap in high school CS, finding barriers that included lack of access to classes (formal boundary), cultural expectations on who the classes were for, feelings of isolation in classes, divisions within classes between those who “have it or don’t have it” (informal boundaries), and lack of social support(personal obstacle). Additional studies found participation and success in computing programs depended on background experience [ 2, 27 ], comfort level [ 27 ], sense of belonging and stereotypes (dis proportionately negatively affecting women) [ 2 , 5, 10, 16 ], view of self as an “insider” [21], and believed role of luck [27]

Glitch game testers [@disalvo_saving_2014; @disalvo_glitch_2009-1; @disalvo_learning_2008]

**Outro**

Illingworth critique's Kafai and Burke's book due to lack of specificity in the game making techniques outlined. This is particularly the case in chapter x which explores cultural elements of game making research. In recent years the constructionist school has taken care to start to describe cultural elements of learning environments [EVIDENCE]. Other approaches exist - AT etc .


## Case Study as example: Digital Braves as a small MoE / 5D project

Digital Braves was a short project which culminated in a session

A product of partnership work at university. Aligning the potential needs of home educated families with exploration of uncomfortable digital issues. It drew on the expertise of the drama department in Manchester Met school of eduction.

It is worth noting that some families who were not attracted to gaming explicitly took part in the research process. Perhaps because of the ethos of the Digital Braves program mitigated fears of working with technology.




## Summary of the thesis motivation and structure

### Recap of motivation

A motivation is to better understand my practice as an activist, community worker and educator.

While I am wary of runaway objects, I am still active in a community and university setting.

An understanding of this controlled experiment in creating culture can shed light on previous work.

Theories of situated learning view transmission of educational practice as a thorny problem as the process of learning is dependant on many contextual factors.

Thus why would this study based on observations of one context be of use?
Thoughts:  
  - similar contexts exist
  - underlying treads may emerge which may transcend context  

#### An area of tension to address - limited leaner choice in process if driven by curriculum.

Authors note that UMC and the value of project based exploration can clash with classroom culture driven by curriculum goals.

    "Constructionist learning experiences are often designed to give the learner agency in the activity, encouraging exploration throughout the process of constructing public and shareable artifacts [16, 26]. The open-endedness can be difficult to adhere to when used in a context where there are specific learning objectives or when trying to introduce new conceptual material or practices. Noss & Hoyles [24] call this the Play Paradox, an inherent tension between supporting a freedom of exploration while constraining the activity to ensure specific concepts or practices are encountered."

Quote from [@franklin_analysis_2020]


### Gaps in existing research / Contribution to knowledge of this thesis


While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research. New software tools to make games which offer new pedagogical possibilities emerge regularly. Game playing practices and the opportunities provided by participation in wider communities also continue to evolve.


Sharing practice for researchers and practitioners is complicated. The results are often too abstract to be useful or easily understood by practitioners or too concrete to replicate. Notable exceptions include design pattern collections and design heuristics like that of Brennan and Silverman [@resnick_reflections_2005]

**Gaps in research**
- Kafai's review on game making research is thin in cultural terms.
- Not many addressing the explicit intention to create a community.  
- Game design patterns emerged in this research as fruitful and is under researched


**Other thoughts on thesis**

This research is valid in the following ways:

- generative nature of research. It has created teaching resources
- the detail of game making pedagogy, suitable for other researcher and Teachers
- tools are novel - media practices are situated, thus will differ with technology
- application of guided participation as lens to this domain
- something about methods using 360 and screen capture?



### Research Questions

- What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to game coding and design?
<!-- - What pedagogical factors are significant to support novices learning coding, particularly in game making contexts? -->
- How can participants build agency in an evolving community of game makers?
- How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?


### Chapter outline

As has been outlined in this introduction the a leading thread of the thesis is my desire to better understand my own experience as a facilitator of learners creating media and digital products in relation with existing research. This chapter has been structured around key contextual factors that have spurred this inquiry and which have emerged from observational research and integrating existing theoretical understandings in this area. While the immediate goal of understanding learning happening in temporary informal environments of learning coding, the findings have implications that of interest to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners who are looking to nurture creative and/or technical design practices in novice learners.  

In line with a situated view of learning the details of process of coding are important. Thus one of the challenges of this work is to explore the details to a non-expert audience. While the literature review will begin to disambiguate some of the terms used in the thesis there is in addition a glossary which outlines short definitions of technical terms used. The glossary is included as an appendix to this study and a summary table is present as an introductory section to the literature review.

The literature review begins the exploration of the key themes and threads that are integral to the findings of this study. These include: authenticity in project based approaches; nature of informal settings in particular home education; barriers to participation in digital making; pedagogies to create inclusive learning environments and to help young people learn computer coding. To follow I outline the theoretical framework and the key methodologies of this study. I explain how the design based research (DBR) aligns well with the aims of the research questions and the use of concepts from the socio cultural school and the leading approach of third generation activity theory (3GAT).

<!-- In doing so I explore the direction of travel of 3GAT and increasing synergies with DBR as methodologies which suit both intervention by researchers into the learning environment being studies and corresponding input by research participants in the resulting design. -->

Chapter three starts with a summary of key concepts aligned with the theoretical framework to aid the analysis of data gathered. This include: the iterative and mutually created and emergent nature of the resources and processes that were created and adopted; identifying a unit of analysis; and transformative conceptions of agency. In the second part of the chapter, I outline the process of how data was gathered, processed and collected using screen capture and 360 cameras. I explore the challenge of gathering large amounts of research data and resulting prioritisation that resulted.   

 <!-- which had been inspired by partnership work between EdLab and the Biosocial Lab -->

Chapter four outlines the learning design that emerged from the research process. To explore emerging tensions in design in a way which communicates relevant context, I outline four conflicts in interrelated activity systems using the terminology of third generation activity theory (3GAT). This chapter discussion begins with an exploration of the tools used through the lens of authenticity. It continues by covering the mutual nature of the evolution of the design, and ends with a synthesis to initial barriers to engaging in game making practices and initial interventions to address them.

Chapter five focuses on the implementation of individual game design patterns (GDPs) and in doing so addresses how data gathered informs thinking on the research question - _how can game design patterns support the development of coding practices by novices_?
This chapter begins by re-examining of game design patterns and game play design patterns in the context of a community of novice coders. Following this a vignette of parent child interaction in game making process introduces an overview of interactions of that pair to help contextualise findings. The chapter then undertakes a systematic analysis of the use of game design patterns by participants drawing on detailed observations of practice. A discussion section explores implications and observations from these findings in relation to existing research and concepts.

Chapter six outline the use of inclusive pedagogical methods that helped participants become part of an emerging community of game makers. It explores the role of the design of games and the surrounding communities that build up around games to support an nurture the development of player identities. The process is shown to have beneficial effects in supporting the creative process. I explore the use of a process drama to draw on their existing knowledge and encourages them to put this into practice via a playful fictional scenario.

Chapter seven concludes the thesis with a final discussion on the significance of my findings in line with other research and discusses the limitations of this research and identifies areas for future work.

It is worth noting at this stage that the process of being guided by personal interests, those of participants and creating and designing
This chapter has explored the context of HE, informal science learning and specifically computer coding and game making. The pedagogies of those areas are explored in the next chapter.
