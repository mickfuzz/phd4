### Vignettes of drama process


#### Vignette 4.1.a - Introducing a drama process

The participants have entered the room and chosen a laptop to work on. Some of the children play web-based games or reviewing the games that they have made previously. The session progresses with a warm-up game which includes many false starts, changes of rules, development of tactics, appeals to be serious, full throated laughter and many restarts and which ends in good hearted failure. The transcript below picks up at this point.

<!-- The purpose of the vignette is to situate the reader, give an overview of -->

> Mick: Ok. So I’ve got a surprise. I don’t know if you know but as part of our Home Ed club we did a page of different games. So it’s on glitch.com and it’s called Glitch Game Club and it’s on there, there’s one for Home Ed Winter 2019 and here are all the games that we made. We made a lot of games. 15 games. This has not gone unnoticed because I got a message through this account. This is kind of a story now. We are entering a story. You have to use your imagination. We got a message and it was an audio message. If you guys take your fingers off your keyboards and have a listen to this audio message which is quite unusual as I don’t think it was from anyone on … this ... Earth.

    Greetings Earthlings, we have an important message for the Glitch Game Makers.
    We are the Weean. You would call us an alien lifeforce. We like to think of ourselves as friendly space cousins.
    We can see your Internet from space. We are contacting you because we know you are making games on the Internet.
    We are on our way to the Planet Earth, and we have an important mission for you. We are an Intergalactic Rescue team. We know you have problems on your planet. We can help.
    But we need to find out one thing first. Are you worth it? After we are gone will you also be able to help yourselves? Or are you already doomed to make the same mistakes again?
    You must pass this challenge. Make some games showing problems you have on earth. In the games also include ideas for how to solve them.

    We have some guidelines:

      • Make a game about a big or small problem to solve. If you can let us play it each week as you go along.
      • Give us an update each week by recording a group update.
      • Show you can work on your own but also work as part of a team.
      • We will also send you text messages with some mini-missions sometimes. Be sure to tell us how you do.

    Please now get started and come up with a new game about solving a problem on Earth.


> Mick: I couldn’t understand all of it but I tried to write it down as best as I can. So from what I’ve work out they’ve looked at our games and they’ve come up with a challenge for us. They are coming to Earth so they need to find out if we are worth saving. And the way that they are going to decide is by playing the games that we come up with. And they are going to set us little challenges. So. yeah, that’s the story. (with heavy irony) I’m pretty sure it’s true. (Mick and others laugh).

> Mick: So all they’re asking us to do is to come up with a game. We’ve got four sessions. They want a new game because they’ve already played our old games. It’s got to be something about the problems of the world. I’ve got a lot of problems. It could be big problem or a small problem. It could be about your problems. But also ideas on how to solve them.  
And yeah. That we can work by ourselves but also work as part of a team. So we’ve got to give them a report by the end of each session as well. That’s our mission.


#### Vignette 4.1.b - Session reflections and secret missions

This second extract comes from the following session in phase four. In three of the four session the last 10 minutes of each session involved giving a progress update to the aliens.

> Mick: Ok are you guys ready to share back if you could come to this side of the room we are going to get Mark and Edward to share back first. Everyone can share back using this computer that the Weean are watching if that’s alright.

> Mark: All we’ve done today is just get a background in and then we were just working on the one that the Weean had sent us about  dropping the coins in. Now that the Weean have sent us the code we need for basically dropping stuff.

> Mark: The idea is planting trees. about dropping seeds. So we want to drop those and have some enemies that are tweening randomly around and also taking them away. The idea is to have a timer to drop a certain amount in a certain time frame or you can’t go through to the next level. And the next level would be you go around and water all the trees. And the third one is you have to look after them all making sure they are not getting chopped down again by that tweening enemy. So we’ve got the concept and everything now and we’ve got the code So we should be able to make a bit of a jump forward now this week.  It doesn’t look like we’ve got any where but we have. (Mark laughs and others follow). So we’ve got the the background in and we know what we need to do about scrolling as well because we want to scroll across.

> Mick: That’s great.  Is there anything that you think you definitely want to be able to do for next time that you might want help with?

> Mark: Oh yeah. We’ll we’ve got a bit of space where we can work on it before we next come in so we’d like to ask the Weean some more questions. Is that the best way to do it?

> Mick: Yeah for sure and I can see that you guys have been talking to the Weean, Here this project here in your home page called Talking to the Weean allows you to talk to the Weean. So you can go in there, click on Edit Project and if you click on this bit here that says WEEAN and then Markdown you can actually just ask questions in here.


> (Mick reads out the following extract the organiser screen containting a text chat with the fictional alien audience)

> Ed: Weean what’s it like up there?

> Weean: It’s cold and very big but quite tranquil.

> Ed: What is your name?

> Weean: We are are the Weean we have no name, we are all the same.

> Ed:  That must be hard at xmas. (Mark and others laugh and smile.)

> Weean: It is. It sure is.

>Mark: That’s tickled me that.

> Mick: So there you go. You can have a conversation there with the Weean in there using mark up code you can copy what’s there. Nadine can you talk through what you have added to your game? Is yours called “No Toby Allowed” now.
(Laughs from all)

> Nadine: I’ve not really done much today as I was busy doing stuff with Toby’s

> Dan:  We noticed.

> Nadine: We’ll I’ve changed the platform a bit

> Molly : You had a secret mission though didn’t you

> Nadine: Oh my secret mission was to change someone’s game, their character  or something and see if they noticed. And I think they did notice.

> Dan: We did. We did notice.

> Molly : You couldn’t not notice.

> Mick: It feels like you took the spirit of the mischievous thing and just turned up the volume.
(All laugh.)

> Molly: Sprite!

> Mark: We also had a secret mission.

> Mick: What was that?

> Mark: Ours was to change the sound on somebodies game.

> Nadine: Oh was it?

> Mark: Did you notice?

> Molly: Did you notice?

> Nadine: No (laughing)
(Incomprehensible many people talking or laughing at same time)

> Mark: Play it now!

> Richie: You definitely noticed. (Points to Mark and Ed) You definitely noticed my bit.

> (Nadine  goes to the keyboard and starts to play her game)

> Nadine: I can’t hear anything different
(Everyone laughs)

> Mark: I thought you were going to go- Aaahgh! But you didn’t say anything.

> Mick: So that’s interesting. some people notice some people didn’t.
