### Introduction to social turn, school,

There are particular limitations in the kind of empirical research that characterises many studies involving.

Many of these limitations involve research in to background cultures of participants and how they can be involved into making activities and a focus on creating and sustaining an authentic learning environment.

The focus of this study is on the construction of shared meaning and practices as part of an emerging community of game makers. To do this I adopt a sociocultural approach and specifically design-based research. This section explores complementary methodologies of value before outlining key characteristics of design-based research which make it an attractive candidate for this study.

This focus on the environment and context is in line with social and cultural lines of research. Socio-cultural research and perspectives can be broadly described as...

For the focus of this study on developing game coding abilities particular aspects of importance are of understanding of the importance of context, and the ongoing development of cultural artefacts

As we have seen in the literature review on game making, context plays out in the way
 that xy, and z.

Barab and Squire [@barab_design-based_2004]


## Justification of choice of methodology

### A social rather than individual constructivism

Cobb [-@cobb_where_1994] identifies two broad schools of constructivism, one focusing more on individual cognitive processes which follows the work of Piaget and the other drawing on the academic lineage of Vygotsky which locates knowledge formation as a cultural activity. Much of the foundational literature on game making focuses on personal dimensions of learning (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996). They draw on Papert's constructionist approach which extends a piagetian take to propose that construction of personal knowledge happens best where learners can experiment and manipulate objects [@ackermannPiagetConstructivismPapert2001] . Such a focus on individual learning is problematic from perspective of sociocultural approaches due to a tendency to ignore both contextual factors influencing the learning setting and the evolving use of resources, processes and shared understandings by emergent communities of learners [@oloughlinRethinkingScienceEducation1992] . Some of the specifics of these processes have already been named in the section above looking at collaboration. Other concepts of value include Vygotsky's concept of mediated action Wertsch, 1994); Rogoff's [-@rogoffObservingSocioculturalActivity1993] take on guided participation within a community of learners; and more detailed analysis of roles community-based transfer of knowledge in practice Lave and Wenger [-@laveSituatedLearningLegitimate1991].

While noting the limits of an individualist approach of many studies from constructionist researchers, it is important not to dismiss the value of this lineage of studies. Notably, later work from Kafai incorporates broader social approaches and attempts to bring them into the constructionist fold @kafaiConstructionistGamingUnderstanding2015. Kafai and Burke draw on the conceptions of Rogoff [-@rogoffObservingSocioculturalActivity1993] of personal, social and community learning planes to advocate the wide-ranging benefits of 'constructionist gaming'.

However for this study constructionism seems of best value in providing design guidelines but much weaker as either an underlying theoretical or analytical framework. SEE WORK ON BARAB TO INFORM CONTRAST TO CONSTRUCTIONISM IF NEEDED.

As my study seeks to address cultural factors which act as barriers to participation in digital making, it requires a method of research which allows the detailed description and evaluation of complex, emergent learning environments.

There are a range of valid methodological approaches suited to this study. These include participatory design Muller, 2007), ethnography and guided participation,  communities of practice [@laveSituatedLearningLegitimate1991] , Activity Theory .  

I have chosen to use a design based research and to draw on the work of Rogoff [@rogoffObservingSocioculturalActivity1993; -@rogoffGuidedParticipationCultural1993] of ethnography and three planes of activity


## Design-based research and Intervention studies within educational field

My own research in game making is an experimental approach to create a new learning design. I have worked with young learners, local families and undergraduate student helpers to evolve a game making design. A key driver of my research was to explore the potential to draw on family experience in learning activities by working with families to make games together. I propose that this environment is a fertile research base to jointly create learning activities with a wider potential application. To facilitate this goal I have taken a design-based approach which acknowledges the importance of context in educational research [@brown_design_1992]. Design based research is a varied discipline which can take a multitude of forms [@mckenney_educational_2021]. The core elements include: research as an intervention, iteration, involvement of participants in the evolution of designs, and a flexibility of research outcome based on how events unfold [@easterday_design-based_2014]. One of the key motivations of this approach is to produce educational research that has a high utility for practitioners through developing theory that is rooted in contextual practice and which can produce new pedagogies and resources [@cobb_design_2003-2].  

Barab and Squire [-@barab_design-based_2004] describe the messiness of design-based research and that this creates a challenge to the researcher of how to present results in a coherent way which is of use to other practitioners. There is a tension between sticking closely to the context of the research and the concrete specifics or stepping back to generalise and being lost in abstraction. Here, I try to strike a balance which stays concrete but which also pulls from my observations a framework which may translate in to other game-making and creative project based approaches.

Another guiding principle of design-based research - which is present in the techniques of design experiments, mutual appropriation and participatory action research - is that research participants also influence the ongoing design of the research [@barab_critical_2004; @cobb_design_2003; @downing-wilson_design_2011]. The design of the research experiment and learning I started from a very open position and has evolved from several iterations of collaborative work with participants. One experimental team consisted of Home Educating families another involved local primary schools with Year 6 (10-11 year old) classes. Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly. Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.

## Justification of GDP as choice of primary unit of analysis

## Focus on the analysis of the implementation of GDP as a key unit of analysis

NOTE: This may move the justification of GDP as unit for analysis to previous section on Methodology / Design?

In the last chapter we explored inclusive pedagogical methods that helped participants become part of an emerging community of game makers. In that community-focused analysis, the unit of activity/ analysis was the creation by individuals learners or pairs of an engaging game with an additional goal of exploring an environmental concept. This chapter analyses a sub-activity system to the creation of the whole game, namely the implementation of individual game design patterns.
Make link to 3 foci too?

 <!-- I argue that this activity and dependant actions became the primary unit of activity for participants. -->
<!-- (see blunden for more on project as unit of Activity
https://www.activityanalysis.net/andy-blundens-vision-of-activity-theory/ )  -->

<!-- NOTE - Thus GDP can be seen as a sub-activities of the wider overall goal of making a game. Which invites discussion on why GDP were chosen as the primary unit of analysis. -->

From the perspective of participants, the goal of implementing individual game patterns rather than the overall goal of making of a game, took up the majority of their focus. This can be evidenced in the following observations;

- the frequency of GDP language referring to patterns used by pairs in particular in the process of collaborating on their games
- the utility of the smaller unit of analysis in aiding resource creation
- the value of completing something concrete a sense of sustaining achievement.
- the ability to reflect after implementing each sub project,
- any other value for practitioners, parents and young participants - i.e. in navigation and goal setting.

<!-- NOTE - DISCUSS THE THEORETICAL INPUT IN RELATION TO THE ABOVE POINTS.
NOTE MORE THEORETICAL INPUT - DRAW ON TERMINOLOGY - WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO IDENTITY KEY UNITS OF ACTIVITY / ANALYSIS (AND WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UNIT OF ACTIVITY AND ANALYSIS) -->

<!-- review this video to develop
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMi56ZBSows -->

<!-- We have also looked at the other studies which look at game design patterns as a useful tool for advanced and less frequently for notice coders.  -->

<!-- In the following sections, I draw on observations of participants in practice to outline how game design patterns are used in the making of games.  -->


## Sociocultural Methods of Analysis

My process is informed by the work of  the work of Rogoff [@rogoffObservingSocioculturalActivity1993; -@rogoffGuidedParticipationCultural1993] of ethnography and three planes of activity.

Include the following points in this section.

- Suitability of this framework for informal education.
- Justification of smaller data size and depth of analysis.

### Stages of Data Gathering and ANALYSIS

 - Early gathering via journal / notes / practioner interviews
 - Mutual nature of the design progressions -


#### Mutual nature of the evolution of the design


### Role of Practitioner interviews

These were limited in number but were a rich source of thinking to help develop and deepen my reflection in journal form and to inform lines of thinking. The chosen interviewees represented a diversity in audience.

Saskia Leggett - researcher in Family Learning program under direction of Roque. She took a leading role in creating the recourses coming out of the program.

Matt - academic at. Also active in a non-profit learning coding

Dave  - Parent and volunteer at Coder Dojo and participant in

James Clegg - PGCE student and volunteer student helper for a summer program of game making.



## Data gathering methods and justification

My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer (facilitator and designer), participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. Specifically I will study in detail the use of the online help tutorials and example code snippets I have created and the code and other media content that participants create in their resulting video games. I also include other methods which suit the deeper analysis of participant actions to help construct models of activity systems, namely the videoing of the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants.

One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour. Large amounts of video data are being gathered, up to 20 hours of footage for each 2 hour session. I am developing a process of identifying appropriate episodes for closer analysis.

Turning attention to the gathering and analysis of other data, such a rich set of data, will allow the cross referencing of the many sources. My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music. To be able to effectively analyse these diverse sources, I will need to prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes. I explore some of the emerging themes and criteria for selection which incidents to explore in depth in the results section below.

Again while diversity of data invites drawing on diverse methods of analysis, AT will provide a foundation for the analysis of these diverse data.

<!-- WHAT IS THE FOUNDATION FOR ANALYSIS ?
CERTAINLY FINDING AND RESOLVING TENSIONS.

There is a framework for looking at tensions here.
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sce.21254?casa_token=cBrHq4V42XUAAAAA:qLvlA17sLIGDHnxN_XqTgZpBDP39phmbLXVzu6QFn89LzBtXshp-y4hFVmi2CvmWTYdj50XNe2qSqg -->

## Data Processing

There is sometimes a danger of imagining how a new data gathering tool could be useful but then not being aware of all of the potential pitfalls which can make processing the data time consuming. Also the very nature of working with video is time consuming.

On a personal note, I sometimes like the challenges involved and sometimes find them infuriating. It can be like a specialist knowledge which you can use as a currency, or as a hidden knowledge that you take pride in sharing.

I use a software sustainability approach also influenced by a personal modification of permaculture computing ideas and ideas of free software and open document approaches.

- Data portability and interoperability
- Software sustainability, in particular longevity
- Licencing - FLOSS licence ?
- If proprietary - then what is the business model?
- Is batch processing of files possible?
- It it a cross platform approach - in particular can I use it on debian based linux systems?

I also take a more practical approach which takes into account working with peers and that such advocacy is not a core part of my job or this research.

Such an attitude may involve compromises or hacking systems, software or processes

### 360 Video Processing

The processing of video and audio data of both captured screens and 360 video data and high quality audio data involved several stages. This process is outlined briefly to document useful findings and observations in the process.

The use of 360 data yields some advantages in capturing the gestures and facial expressions of potentially all participants in one recording. It does however present challenges.

Here is a short table outlining challenges and solutions to 360 video processing.

- split video files - can be corrupted thus you only lose one - but also can be confusing
- time navigation - also confusing - sometimes put up on the screen - but inconsistently
- moving and keeping a track of data from week to week and over years is complex.
- processing data requires special software - from samsung
- viewing data on a normal vlc player - needs extra processing using spatial media

<!-- Tech details are logged here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p6m20wehYkTeevj9QucpzKCR4NioELndg2rZeLWFK-c/edit# -->

### Screen Capture Processing

Justification of choice.
Flashback pro - on Uni computers.
Also a reasonable price for paying to use on home computers.
Has a batch processing tool for saving as open ish format files.

Flashback saves data as its own fbr format. This include audio, video screen capture, and optionally one or more webcams.

I decided not to record on webcams. For the following reasons:

- intrusive feel - having the webcam on and the resulting red light on the screen, I felt was less conducive to feeling comfortable than one 360 camera in the middle of the room.
- less resources - recording webcam on the laptop
- reduced video file size of final data file
- less complexity when processing data -

One advantage of the fbr format is that you can examine key strokes that the participant has made while interacting with the keyboard and see their mouse travel over the screen and see when they click on different parts of the screen.

However, it not possible to code the natively created files directly. Thus need to be converted to mp4 to import into coding software like Nvivo. In this process the keyboard and mouse data is lost.

Thus original files have been retained in order to cross reference that data if it is useful. It also presents other options for analysis which are similar to much more in depth analysis of HCI research of professional set ups. While this is beyond the remit of this study, certain uses do present themselves strongly for future investigation. Particularly the study of such data to identify common mistakes or frustrations when interacting with the user interface. Such misconceptions could be addressed in direct teaching at the start of the next session.


### General File management

This whole process is intensive for file management. Making me create a linux commandline toolbox.

### Learnings and recommendations

The following learning and recommendations emerged from this process.

Prioritise displaying time - have an old school clock under the 360 camera. For example.

Check viability of data at each stage of processing and movement.

## Data analysis methods and justification

My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer, participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. I also record the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants. One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour.

While the rich set of data invites the cross referencing of the many sources, it also presents challenge on how to deal effectively with the large amounts of data being gathered. The use of a 360 camera reduces the amount of live video footage of interactions needed. Instead of multiple cameras pointed in different directions to capture participant interaction, participants are arranged in a square pointing inwards towards a central 360 degree camera. When triangulating data from various sources, I will prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes.

### Other Material - Analysis of Data

My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use and other relevant interests. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music.

<!-- AT allows an exploration these diverse sources of information as mediating artefacts which are the enabler and product of the shifting goals and outcomes of the programmes participants. -->

<!-- A key strategy of AT used to locate learning happening in an environment, is via the identification of contradictions between different elements of the activity systems and subsequent study of how these contradictions are resolved (Engeström and Sannino, 2010). I plan to use my journal and participant interviews to identify key moments of contradictions and resolution to study in greater detail using the range of data available. I am also inspired by the work of Oliver and Pelletier (2006)who employed contradictions between systemic elements to create a coding scheme used to interpret video data in a study on game based learning. -->


### Analysis of Journal and Teaching Resources

The process of analysis of journal notes and resulting resources required a different approach from that of video data.

#### Overall Rational and Approach
The following resources were examined

- Book Journal pages
- Digital journal entries directly in response to going
- Linear support book and print outs to support participants in sessions
- Additional 3M model resources to help navigation and reflection and gameful approaches

TO DO - IT MAY BE HELPFUL TO CREATE A TABLE OR DESCRIBE THESE IN MORE DETAIL

Journal Notes were used in the following ways: (perhaps code this)

- as a reflective tool after sessions
- as a note pad to plan resource creation
- as a sketch pad to explore the relationship between Concepts being explored and existing game making frameworks
- as a

The quantity of data prevented extensive and detailed coding using a grounded thematic analysis.
Rather than taking a grounded approach which would take too long given the quantity of data, this data was analysed using 3 planes of sociocultural activity. The rationale for this is as follows:

 - Using an existing relevant framework saves time, especially as a more emergent approach was  (in part ) in coding video data.
 - RQx addresses the formation of a game-making community. This process is co-constituted by planners, facilitators, parents and children. This dynamism and dialogue can be captured in this framwork using the concept of guided participation.
 - The advantages of drawing on funds of knowledge, and the activities that I used to do this, as well as connecting to wider communities are address well with the plane of culture, in the concept of Apprenticeship.
 - While more complex, the plane of more individual participatory appropriation, allows for alignment and then transfer to more formal learning environments. This then makes this research more relevant to class room and guided sessions.
 - While the three planes provided a higher level framework, the specifics of the data gave greater granularity and formed sub categories of coding - thus avoiding the problem of analytic preconceptions.


### Specifics of Coding

#### Choosing what and how much to code

A page of quick analysis of the files online here helped to shape that decision.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpAIqHPg_Z0S5MWeS0rBTvxCL1N9NQButam4Ozq39Ek/edit#

Criteria include

- In the first two runs of data collection - single technology
- Good quality recording
- Diversity of kinds of participants, ages especially
- Diversity on participant actions
- Diversity of interactions between participants present across choices


#### Using a 3 Planes Approach

 The analysis of these resources using the three planes involved a choice of some of the following

- scanning written document and converting digital documents for inclusion into nvivo for formal Coding
- using a spread sheet and putting categories and notes in to columns
- using trello or other Kanban
- using a table in word to record notes on data in-situ

The video data explored in nvivo is very time consuming, and given this and the factor that the transforming reflections into  learning resources, already involves a process of filtering, a much courser level of data analysis. However, using a static text only approach such as describing data in prose or using a table in a word document does not allow for filtering based on themes which is potentially useful as an analyitical too.  
Thus using MS Excel as a simple way to collate data without translation seems appropriate.


#### Note on creation of learning and teaching resources  

The process of refining this reflection into learning and teaching resources was complex and iterative. The following paragraph illustrates the process using a case study?
[PERHAPS LOOK AT THE ELEMENTs OF A GAME DIVISION? - FINAL DESTINATION - SPACE, MECHANICS, POLISH]


### Video Coding - Analysis of Data

I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies [@derry_conducting_2010]. I use a variant of discourse analysis to explore interactions of participants captured on video recordings. Mercer and colleagues identify discourse analysis as a loose associations of methods to support linguistic analysis of interactions to identify emergent patterns [@mercer_methods_2004]. While a common pattern in classroom interactions is that of IRF, initiation (teacher), response (student) and follow up (teacher) [@sinclair_towards_1975] , the inherent assumption that a teacher will be leading an activity will not consistently be appropriate for my study; although at times a parent may take this role. Other discourse analysis frameworks that take a sociocultural approach [@lyle_investigation_1993; @phillips_beyond_1985], and specifically those from project focused studies [@hmelo-silver_facilitating_2008; @moje_maestro_2001] allow more detailed treatment of the incorporation of tools and cultural artefacts into a collective discourse.

<!-- To avoid distraction from AT as my principle analytical framework I am in agreement with Wells (1999, p. 172) who proposes the use of AT's concepts to situate 'spoken discourse \... as one, but only one, of the semiotic tools that participants use to achieve the goals of action'. Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals. -->


### Notes on Underpinning of Thematic Analysis of Video Data

Summary of thematic analysis - https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/uploads/production/document/path/18/18247/Kiger_and_Varpio__2020__Thematic_analysis_of_qualitative_data_AMEE_Guide_No_131.pdf

#### Overall Rational and Approach of Coding Video Data

The coding process is not grounded [explain] but informed by literature review and early analysis of journal entries. The gathering of data and revision of teaching materials took place over several years. As such, there was time for extensive reflection and reconsideration of factors involved in the learning design in dialogue with existing literature on game making and game making communities.

How much emphasis to place on the Thematic Analysis is questionable. It served to answer the research questions in the following ways.

- as a process to get closer to the data
- to contrast thematic analysis of the stages of design with other learning models like PBL
- to identify roles through repeated patterns of interactions
- to reflect on the thesis questions

Following the approach of Morcom -@morcomScaffoldingSocialEmotional2014, I drew on Rogoff's -@rogoffObservingSocioculturalActivity1993 three planes of sociocultural activity used to help understand activity in a Community of Learners.  

#### What was Excluded and Rationale

The following themes were excluded but did emerge as potential learning outcomes in the final model;

- Elements of Computational Thinking
- Systems Thinking Concepts

They have been excluded as there is other extensive or focused work in these fields (previously explored in the literature review) on CT which this study which this study does not need to replicate.

#### Coding Participant Roles and Interactions.

Evolving notes on coding of roles and interactions are in an online document here. https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit

Roles are different from interactions existing on a higher order of anaysis. Repeated patterns of interactions can be seen to develop into roles. Thus a more grounded approach may concentrate initially on interactions and develop this to become roles through analysis. However, many roles exist in other similar domains.

For example, the work of my own staring point when coding was guided by Barron and colleagues work on the roles of parents as learning partners [-@barron_parents_2009]. The roles are as follows: Teacher, Collaborator, Learning Broker, Resource Provider, Nontechnical Consultant, Employer, and Learner.

when coding I started with some preset codes from the literature for examples Barron's codes on parent roles when helping digital projects. However, as coding progressed, I modified and extended these codes to better match the data I was working with

Specifically, the following were removed from Barron's typology, parent as employer, non-technical consultant. Learning broker and resource provider were merged as some of the detail of those roles involve take place outside of the learning environment being analysed in coded video.

 I judged it appropriate to and less complex to analyse and code the interaction between participants rather than code the behaviours by participant type.

#### Coding Design Cycle Stages

There are similar stage based approaches to creating a digital project. Firstly project based learning (PBL), then Inquiry based learning, finally design thinking. This design could adopt any one of these, however the creation of a digital product more closely resembles a design approach with testing stages of the created product.

The design process characteristics are broadly as follows; the process is often iterative, involves evaluation and separates planning from implementation.

Resnick in this area has written of a creative design spiral.

The model is similar to the ADDIE model from instructional system design: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. The discipline of teaching engineering also has a similar design stage cycle with many contesting variations [@winarno_steps_2020]. Engineering is Elementary project adapted from the ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) guidelines [@syukri_impact_2018] involves the following steps; Ask, Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share @hester_engineering_2007.

It has been adopted by the area of computing is one used in a recent book on coding by Bers @bers_coding_2021.

It is possible to be more specific when coding and include a wider terminology of technology and domain specific language. For example, debugging in the area of computer programming and playtesting in the domain of game making. I have had to weigh up the value of including these more specific terms and deciding to keep a more generic approach primarily to reduce complexity while undertaking video coding. Sub-categories add complexity and time to the process without necessarity adding a great deal.  
ADD IN A JUSTIFICATION BASED ON HOW RESULTS PAN OUT.

#### Coding Game Design Themes

The process of learning game making through deepening your knowledge of game elements is explored  by Jesse Schnell -@schellArtGameDesign2008.

Coding based on the game elements that are being added to the game serves to xxx ?

As way of coding initially I considered the MDA framework for the simplicity.

- mechanics
- aesthetics
- dynamics

Later, I note the following limitations.
- The language is not accessible to teachers and learners.
- The definition of aesthetics is very wide incorporating user experience in a way that was not suitable to learners.

Later consider...

In early stages I was influenced by the categorisation of game elements used by GSM team which also was implemented in the Game Jam Guide [@cornish_game_2018; @institute_of_play_gamestar_nodate].
The key elements are:

- SPACE: Where the game takes place.
- GOAL: What is the objective of the game? What are you trying to do?
- COMPONENTS: What are all the objects or actors in the game?
- MECHANICS: What actions take place in the game. What are the verbs involved?
- RULES: What can or can’t you do in the game? What defines boundaries? Does play happen in real time or do you take turns?

A blend of the two gave the following staring coding scheme in terms of activities related directly to adding features or altering the game.

### Grades of video data analysis

Describing different grades and pass overs of the video data.

 Initial notes on contents of video recordings: notes on kinds of activities happening and quality of Data

Then deciding on 8-10 video sessions warranting full coding of activity.
This was based on the following factors, quality of recording, how much activity, richness of interactions, a range of diffent kinds of participant interactions.

Notes on goals, activities, interactions, fragments of dialogue and brief observations. Video coded in segments in Nivivo
In this level, the rough coding involved by breaking up video timescales into 5 minute sections lessens the ability to make exact claims however for this study it opens up lines of initial questioning which can be explored in future studies or triangulated with other data in this study.

Another level went over the 5 min sections looking for data relevant to 3 planes analysis - how was activity able to be interpreted culurally, socially personally.
This generated points for results chapters.

- Full transcription of key moments: and description of participant activity, activity on screen including simple gesture analysis


### Limits of / problems with video data analysis

The choice of the videos to code more fully is rather skewed towards finding interesting data. Thus it may not be fully representative of the experience of all participants.

Choosing in a different way - around less interaction - would expose more barriers to participation to game making using the 3M model.


### Analysis of activities based on Cultural, Interpersonal and Personal focusing

As per Rogoff.

Not coded in nvivo. However this was a useful phase.

Note on the spreadsheet used to transfer from coded document.
A summary of the activity and then what implications did it have under each.


### Discussion - post mortem - PERHAPS SHIFT TO LAST CHAPTER finally

The process of trying to decide a main focus was often tricky.

Take for example the process of Da in 2019-05-08 - where he was leading some fairly advanced work on researching and reading developer documentation and the constructing a new design pattern.

There are competing and overlapping intention and foci here for the participants.
 - Solve immediate problem - add new pattern
 - communicate cultural practice of finding, reading and adapting developer level documentation and help from forums.
 - give hands on experience to the notice coder

Most clearly there is an overlap here between the interpersonal working on a code problem collaboratively for educational purposes and the interactions with the wider cultural artefacts and practices from a professional environment.

Thus the process of writing this up was not neat.
To overcome this issue...

In addition the personal plane was perhaps the most problematic to address given the data gathered.
Even when participants were demonstrating their personal knowledge by sharing back or directly altering game code, this was as part of a social and cultural practice.
Thus my interpretation involved ....


### Data Validity - Triangulation of Data

### Generalisation of Results

Generalisation is one of the guiding principles of DBR. While results are intertwined with context, designs should be assessed for generalisation to other settings.
Explore this in more detail - draw out a debate on how situated learning in this context - and wider debate is.

More than one iteration.
In different settings
Using different with different software

This is potentially complex to describe but worth it if wanting to talk about generalisation.

<!--
Generalisation is covered in this thesis.

<!-- In early stages of delivery I adopted an open project based approach. I will later describe how this evolved in to a template game using a javascript game making library and an online tool used for phases 1-4 which participants were invited to add to and alter.

The last iterations of the learning design adopted the MakeCode Arcade tool as a new game authoring tool. This block based programming environment reduced participant coding errors allowing a greater focus on game making concepts. -->

## Research Questions

- What  game making pedagogies exist?
- DROP? What methods exist to scaffold / seed the creation of a game / digital making community of learners? And what value does a community have?
- How can game patterns support the development of coding practices by novices?
- How can parent and child participant experiences of a community focused digital game making programme inform broader digital making practices?


### How Research Questions Evolved

About RQs and RD1 and RD2 and their evolutions.

Different stages of revisiting. Examine journal and other writings and presentations for strands of thinking.

Part of this early writing up process is to revise research questions. To so this I've used a Kanban software allowing rapid revision and repositioning of questions and concepts. [What is a KanBan approach. ]

Themes emerging include the alternation of abstract and concrete as a suggested learning journey, explored in my journal. However this seems to be explored in research on semantic waves with studies of more breadth so it did not seem a good idea to follow that thread in my thesis. There was something about the formalisation of this process into graph form which put me off. I also realised that the frameworks that I spent a while trying to make accessible and gameful in the design, grouping and theming of their presentation, had strong similarities to concepts of abstract curriculum if explored through a semantic waves lens. Curriculum seemed too well a well trod path for a PhD thesis.  

Instead the community elements of the learning experience regained focus during the process of coding. There were particularly interesting elements of the learning environment which contributed to notable behaviours. The area of in-depth study of learning and wider behaviours in the development of coding. Work on roles by Barron  and developed by Roque showed promise identifying helpful roles and reflecting them back to participants. Such reflection sessions were not always replicable with a general home education group or other non-formal setting.  Could this implemented in the design, in the way reflective techniques were implemented in to games. Thus making it more playful/ gameful.

### What research questions are answered by what data gathering and analysis - and described in what chapter?

 <!-- See the thesis by Digital Game Education: Designing interventions to encourage players’ informed reflections on their digital gaming practices Rafael Marques de Albuquerque

Perhaps represent this as a table.
Not sure if the title tries to do too much.

Change the below to a table in these planning stages.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RZnznbR4HKrgL8VFfIqoCrCAJM0mf_sM8iEN4KCGeZ4/edit

### RQ1 - What game making pedagogies exist? -

This has already answered been addressed in the Literature Review.

### RQ2 - How can you apply Project Based Learning principles (and inclusive teaching methods) to a game making / creative coding?

This is covered in the first results chapter on evolution of the design. Working title "Evolution of 3M model"

The formation of

- Literature review -
- Interviews with practitioners guided the design in broad principles.
- Interviews with participants some informal and some formal instructed directly adaptations to design
- Journal notes
- Changes to the resources themselves - in tandem with journal notes,   
- Analysis of video data (stage one)

### RQ3 - How do game patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?

This is an interesting one to code for
And also related to autonomy?


### RQ4 - What effect does a pedagogical model focused on PBL principles (especially learner choice) have on parent and child learner experiences of digital game making ?

what about focusing on agency / autonomy / self regulation for this question.


### Description of Phases

I have carried out three stages of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline activities that have taken place at each stage of activity and include some early results.

<!-- I have carried out six phases of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline the core activities that have taken place including only the most basic detail on tools used. In following sections, the development of toolsets are analysed in greater depth. The core of the game making programme, which emerged in the first phase and has remained, is a starting template of a simple platform game which participants alter to make their own. The evolution of different versions and locations of this starting template has proven to be a key marker of the progress of the programme. The timeline of phases of activities is outlined in the following table.
