# Findings: Game Design Patterns

## Research Questions April 2025

- **Primary research question (RQP):** How can understandings of how to design and facilitate CGD&P be enriched using socio-cultural approaches (used in this study)?

**Sub-question 1 (RQ1):** What contradictions arose in this research’s evolving design process and how were they addressed in the resulting CGD&P pedagogy?

- **Sub-question 2 (RQ2):** How can the use of a collection of game design patterns support CGD&P, in particular in relation to abstract and concrete dimensions of existing pedagogies?

- **Sub-question 3 (RQ3):** How can varied dimensions of agency be identified and nurtured in an evolving community of game makers?

<!-- **On GDP as a germ-cell and unit of analysis recap of design patterns** -->
<!-- In the introduction of this thesis, I outlined some of the broader challenges of sharing practice and research to practically support the learning of coding practices beyond the immediate context of the research in question. The choice of what scope of activity to examine in detail is relevant to this challenge.  -->

Software design patterns are a grouping of a description of target project behaviour, with a suggested community solution of code structure often accompanied with worked examples (see Chapter 2). While existing research explores the use of game design patterns in educational settings, for instance to aid the transfer of science simulation concepts to other contexts [@repenning_scalable_2015; @basawapatna_using_2010] or as a foundation for co-design work [@eriksson_using_2019], there is limited work addressing their role in overcoming challenges faced by emerging communities of game creators using text coding. In the previous chapter, I outlined the evolution of tool use, emphasising emerging tensions in activity. The importance of gameplay design patterns (GDPs) emerged from participant input in P1 and were then integrated by myself into various forms of scaffolding within and graded step of practice including: quick-start activities, instructional tutorials, and code snippet examples. This chapter shifts focus to the perspectives of participants, using recorded data to interpret their varied uses and adaptations of GDP use. In doing so, it addresses the research question: How does CHAT theory help us understand how game design patterns can be used in an evolving community of novice game makers?  I describe the use of GDPs as diverse mediational strategies to overcome some of the tensions explored in the previous chapter, not only addressing the use of facilitator-provided resources but also as part of emerging community practices and interpersonal repertoires.

Table 6.1: Summary of varied GDP use within the activity of this research

The above table summarises the principal different uses of GDPs in the data analysed.  In this table and the structure of this chapter, I employ Rogoff's three planes of analysis [@rogoff_observing_1995], as introduced in Chapter Four. This chapter’s sections examine how gameplay design patterns are utilised broadly by parents, children and facilitators, each through the lens of a respective analytical plane. Recognising that these observations do not neatly align with the three planes, I discuss the use of GDPs across cultural activities, interpersonal activity and personal knowledge in three distinct sections.

INCLUDE A MERGED DIAGRAM IF THIS IS REALLY HELPFUL BELOW.

An analogy can be drawn between these three planes of analysis and the examination of activity systems at varying scopes. Specifically, the cultural plane aligns with the community scope of activity described in Figure 5.x in the previous chapter, while the interpersonal and personal planes correspond to smaller scopes depicted in Figure 5.x. A discussion section explores the implications of these findings in relation to existing research and theoretical concepts.

This was particularly valuable in the Key Door Person interchange where meaning was not clear before looking at video.
In previous chapter on methodology we (will) have examined the coding scheme used to code specifics on interactions and participant behaviour and output.

<!-- For the preceding ten minutes, the parent and child dyad had been struggling with a tutorial chapter in the online course manual textbook, included as Appendix.tech.samplechapter, which explains how to add the pattern of keys and doors. In this pattern, players must collect a key and then navigate to a door to progress to the next level. The parent, Susanna, had been making multiple changes to the code while the child, Tehillah, expressed boredom. Susanna then suggested that Tehillah ask the facilitator, Mick, for help in resolving the coding issue. Once the bug was resolved, Susanna handed the keyboard to Tehillah to test the now working game. The implementation of a new game design pattern (GDP) involves adding new code to the game. The amount of code and changes required varies depending on its complexity. Larger changes typically require more careful manipulation of code and subsequent debugging. The key and door pattern is relatively technically challenging to implement. Tehillah is one of the younger participants, and the parent, Susanna, has taken on the role of solving harder coding problems and, in doing so, has built important proficiency in coding practice.

The parent takes action to involve her child in the design process when technically possible and to incorporate her child's interests. Susanna overcomes her own hesitancy about asking for facilitator help by encouraging her child to seek assistancehttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ce2cYIYnFCd9GM8zRntBd7lrud-dMbbrtgEQMoGNRmE/edit?tab=t.0. When the coding problem is resolved, Susanna signals to Tehillah that it is her turn to return to the design process. This indicates that Susanna recognises the greater potential for effective input from her child at these moments. After the blockage caused by debugging is removed, Susanna immediately re-engages Tehillah, prompting her to play-test the game. Susanna skilfully navigates the process, eliciting and incorporating her child's interests in a variety of ways.

The child also shows initiative, particularly in relation to level design. There is an awareness of and playfulness surrounding the conventions of a platformer game as a dynamic system, which drives their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game. An understanding of the game as a dynamic system becomes especially evident in the parent’s alarm when, shortly after this interaction, the child deletes all elements of hazard in one level. The pair use the names of the game design patterns they are working on (Adding Levels and Keys and Doors) (Key 44 in Vignette 2). Evidence suggests that Tehillah (child) is building a connection to the game-making pattern. In Key 12 in Vignette 2, abbreviations of the GDP names, Key and Door and Levels, are repeated in a sing-song voice. Additionally, my https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ce2cYIYnFCd9GM8zRntBd7lrud-dMbbrtgEQMoGNRmE/edit?tab=t.0description of the Key and Door pattern as a challenging pattern during the session's starting orientation, outlined in Vignette 11, provokes a strong reaction. The use of GDP terms as a lingua franca, a concept that underpins the broader utility of design patterns [@erickson_lingua_2000], to facilitate designing for others is explored in the next section. More broadly, the use of GDP concepts as an evolving design language for providing feedback, sharing knowledge, making requests and other purposes during community activities, pair interactions and individual work is explored in the following sections. -->

For this child developed a cyclical pattern of alternation between higher and lower engagement with the coding processes based on lower engagement the period of time when her parent was problem solving code and higher engagement once it was implemention of the structural element was almost complete. Completion of the code implementation of a GDP allows for new possibilities in design dynamics using the same text matrix level design tool. This stage of working on a new GDP sustains the child's activity. The child shows high engagement at this stage outlining her plan for implementing the pattern in the process of designing their game. sPECIFICALLY SAYING X, Y Z. -->

## The role of GDPs in the personal appropriation of concepts and processes

<!-- As such, the design of this study does not fully address the exploration of the personal appropriation plane of activity.  -->

<!-- In a classroom setting, group activity would likely incorporate a structural motivation to understand and utilise knowledge related to computational thinking concepts or similar curricular content.   -->

<!-- To avoid duplication with community processes and given the overall focus on social and cultural domains in thesis given the deficit in this aspect compared to studies exploring , this section follows -->

Personal appropriation is described in of Kafai and Burke's [-@kafai_constructionist_2015, p.4] review of CGD&P  as "knowledge appropriation and transformation that is instantiated in the process of making games". Rogoff's interpretation of personal appropriation is more complex communicating the bi-directional nature of the process where individual interpretations of community gained knowledge is remediated and fed back into the community. In this informal learning context, the overall motivation of participants was on making an engaging game rather than explicitly developing to knowledge linked to the computing curriculum. Despite this, the evolving design process resulted in activities which did allow the exploration of computational thinking, systems concepts and other computing concepts and proceedures.

Kafai and Burke's review [-@kafai_constructionist_2015] notes the greater number of studies focus on personal dimensions of learning programming and curricular knowledge compared to the deficit regarding social and cultural aspects. To reflect the greater coverage of this area of research, this section is focused on limited aspects of personal appropriation: namely the code patching, debugging and the development of digital literacy skills. I have chose these areas as there were a subject of several observations provoked by the characteristics of the learning design of this research.

<!-- Specifically there was no testing involved and the interview focus was on socio-cultural aspects.  -->

<!-- In P4 aGiven the potential to adapt this learning design to a more formal environment to address the needs outlined in the introductory chapter, from P2 onwards I began to augment the learning design to suit curriculum-oriented teaching and assessment of computational thinking concepts and skills,  -->

I was inspired by the the process and rationale of Bevan and Petrich's [-@bevan_learning_2015; -@petrich_it_2013] work who created a map of learning dimensions to a seemingly chaotic tinkering and making process in museum contexts. As such, during early data analysis, with the potential to adapt this learning design to a more formal environment in mind, I mapped out curriculum-oriented concepts that suited exploration via  in the game making process of this research. This process resulted in a learning map of curricular concepts included here as Table 6.x. For brief definitions of these terms see the Glossary of this thesis.

<!-- NOTE - this map focuses on more concrete concepts,  -->


The map of learning dimensions above includes a balance of skills, concrete and more abstract aspects of coding concepts (Appendix.learningmap explores in more detail the evolution of this map). It aims to address tensions in the integration of concepts into an informal context, specifically, a tension or paradox common in project-based approaches in more formal settings, between the an exploratory learning approach and a possibility or need to align with curricular concepts [@hoyles_pedagogy_1992]. I propose that the play paradox [@hoyles_pedagogy_1992] is addressed by orienting the leading/motivational activity of the learning design to be one aligned with the underlying goals of the participants. In this case to add features to their game. I return to this subject in Chapter 7.

### The interrelationship of GDPs and the development of personal appropriation of skills and processes

It is of value to compare the observational process of creating the learning map to the more intentional, concept-driven design approach described in research on Microworlds, which foregrounds the role of learning designers in shaping the affordances of (playful) learning environments to steer learners toward exploring curricular concepts.  In much of the Microworlds research, these are often scientific or mathematical concepts: take, for example, geometry in Turtle computing with the LOGO language [@ernest_whats_1988]. This design has used several structural constructionist techniques involved in designing Microworlds [@laurillard2020significance], however, as the principal motivation of this study is acculturation within a game-making community, my focus has prioritised procedural skills that facilitate community participation over underlying subject related concepts. Due to limited scope of this section I prioritise an analysis here of the technical practices of web literacy,code patching and debugging. In addition to the use of new techniques being  driven by the implementation of GDPs, the following observations reveal a complex, interdependent relationship between GDP concepts and emergent technical processes.

<!-- While the above learning map is relevant to the overall process of game making. The main focus of this chapter is the exploration of diverse uses of GDPs within this activity, as such I now explore the motivational and mediational uses of GDPs in this personal plane.  -->
<!-- These processes were sometimes introduced in a basic form through scaffolded activities, supporting documentation, or informal interactions between peers. The following observations illustrate how introduced processes were adapted and modified by the community. -->
<!-- In line with Rogoff's understanding of personal appropriation as a bi-directional process, where the appropriation of personal knowledge is shaped by and contributes to a broader sociocultural context, participants actively contributed their interpretations of knowledge back into the communities they belonged to. -->
Addressing digital and web literacies first, to integrate new gameplay design patterns or adapt existing ones in their games, participants needed to develop not only technical processes associated with computer coding, as well as foundational digital skills related to using a desktop personal computer and use of internet browser and online tool ( see Chapter 1 and  Appendix.digitalliteracy). most participants demonstrated increased fluency in these digital and web literacies, particularly in areas such as browser tab use, creating, uploading, and integrating graphical and audio assets, and proficiency in keyboard and mouse use for text manipulation. In line with CHAT theory, this can be interpreted as the gradual operationalisation of actions that initially required more explicit guidance, as discussed by Leontiev [@leontiev_activity_2009].

In this process, GDPs functioned as both a motivational and conceptual tools facilitating interpersonal knowledge exchange, as explored in the following example. In Vignette 5 (sections V5.a and V5.c), Madiha(p) seeks assistance from her daughter Nasrin to format and export graphical files for use in the game code project. In this section Madiha has just finished created a pixel art sprite of an alien in the Piskel graphical web app but is unsure of how to transfer the image from Piskel into the glitch coding environment, and and make the relevant coding changes to place the imported asset into her game.

    Madiha(p): We’re finished. Right what’s next? Now I’m an expert pixel? Now I have to figure out how to get it in there don’t I? Without losing it I’ll be very upset.

    Sonia(p): Have you saved it?
    Madiha(p):– No I’ve not saved it.
    Sonia(p):– Save there. (points to relevant button on screen)
    ...
    Madiha(p): Nasrin! Nasrin! Nasrin!
    Madiha(p): Do you know how to get it in the game?
    Nasrin(c): Oh my god!

    Madiha(p): Well . First of all save it to the gallery. How do you save it? Ah there you are. Save it. Is it saved? Right now export it.

    Nasrin(c): Do you even know what export means?
    Madiha(p): I know what export means!
    Nasrin(c): Ok then smartie pants.

The implementation of Madiha(p) chosen GDPs drives the development of these technical processes, as she must either learn them herself or draw on peer knowledge to complete the task. She is clearly invested in her creative products, so much so that a fellow parent highlights out the process to saving images.

In another example, changing pen colours in the graphical tool is a process that Nasrin(c) has already internalised and performs effortlessly, whereas Madiha(p) is still deliberately working to build her competency. Nasrin(p) has fully operationalised the process, incorporating it into her repertoire of practices.

<!-- Similarly, in section V5.d, Madiha receives help from a peer, Ed, in using the cropping tool to remove redundant space at the edges of sprite characters after he playtests her game. -->

**Code Patching as a guided technical process and the use of GDPs to nurture tactical responses to coding errors**

GDPs also functioned a container for structured project stages, facilitating the initial use of procedures as illustrated in this section using the example of code patching. Code patching is a professional technical process to scaffold the application of new features in computer programming (see Glossary and Chapter 2). This patching process became an important element of documentation. Although code was provided, mistakes occurred in practice and additional customisations were introduced. Video evidence and observational journal notes highlight the potential of coupling code implementation with target behaviour, structured within a framework of GDPs. The following extract from Vignette 1 shows an example of code patching in practice.  This vignette extract is included to show both the technical process of code patching explored here and the process of accessing documentation covered in the following section on guided participation.

-->

Personal appropriation and increasing fluidity in terms of web literacies are well illustrated in Toby’s unaided incremental changes to level design, and the navigation of between code and game preview windows. By way of contrast his use of supporting documentation to undertake the code patching process is still hesitant and intentional. Toby's eventual success in using the code patching and debugging technique was supported by the high level of contextualisation provided by the structuring of the process around GDPs[^1]. As a facilitator (see Appendix.patching), I made explicit the path between choosing a pattern to work on and the mechanics of accessing documentation and the code patching process. In the vignette we can see that debugging motivated was facilitated by the participants strong understanding driven of what the desired GDP should provoke in the target behaviour of the games. The need to get both the starting and ending position of the movement of the imported enemy provokes several iterations of debugging.  

The process of code patching process often provoked such glitches. Glitches are errors which allow the game to continues to function but which provoke an unintended effect (see Appendix Debugging). As a facilitator I mobilised participants existing knowledge of GDP behaviour to compare erroneous behaviour with desired behaviour  as an inclusive strategy to mitigate the potentially frustrating process of debugging.(Appendix Debugging)

  Some examples contain processes that are linked to the language and the concepts and player experience of GDPs, for example the use of GDP language of hazards and rewards (see extract).

  Other examples are more secondary where the emerging processes and adoption of language concern more to do with more general digital design,  which are needed due to the process of implementing game features - which are in this case structured via GDPs. -->

SHIFT LATER?
As previously explored I had a reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge.

- Aesthetics and the end user experience motivated some users greatly, while it is not clear if this game code changes in this dimensions fully constitute a gameplay design pattern, they are an important inclusive element of the design. -->




## GDPs used in the process of guided participation


This section examines data on the use of GDPs from the perspective of interpersonal interaction. Here, the process of being guided into planned activities or peer collaboration is exploratory, contributing to interpersonal processes that facilitate the completion of tasks. As outlined in the previous section, personal understandings of knowledge can be observed within these interpersonal interactions, particularly in exchanges between parents and children. Based on observations of video data, I describe how GDPs are employed in diverse mediational strategies.

UPDATE THIS
I focus on three key categories of interaction that incorporate GDPs: the use of a provided menu of GDPs and supporting documentation, the role of GDPs in project ideation and prioritisation, and their function within the division of labour.

NOTE - MENTION THE MENU GUIDED BY  ME - THUS MY INPUT INTO GUIDED PARTICIPATION .

## The use of GDPs examined from an interpersonal focus
This section examines the use of GDPs to facilitate guided participation via interpersonal interactions in game making. Guided participation in this context involved, guidance on organising design activities, various forms of problem solving and help to shift design perspectives. While the primary source of material is from pair interactions between children and parents, at times peer interaction between non-pairs developed into guidance. For example, in the in the example above where Toby provides assistance for Bertie  in adding levels to his game

<!-- However, not all participants used the provided instructions and developed diverse methods to access support for implementing patterns (IS THIS PART NEEDED?). -->

Chapter 5 introduced my provision of a curated collection (menu) of gameplay design patterns to address the tension between participants' choice and the need for documentation to support the technical implementation of code structures. In the vignette extract above Toby uses the graphical menu of patterns  to choose and implement a features. using supporting documentation. Later he is able to assisting others in adding the same GDPs to their games (see V1.b).As explored in Chapter 5, to prioritise participant engagement, I avoid a principles-first instruction approach (either to the whole group or to individuals). The use of shorter, just-in-time tutorials here reduces barriers associated with more extensive instruction-based approaches, particularly those related to literacy [@dietz_design_2021; @resnick_coding_2020]. In this section, I outline findings on the use of the menu of GDPs, focusing on interpersonal interactions.



<!-- In Vignete 9, I address the whole group, describing the webpage presenting the menu of GDPs as a hub to help choose project goals and locate tutorials and code examples. "It’s almost like this is our control panel. You decide what you want to do next and we jump off from there." -->
<!-- **tautology** Given the integration of these elements into the learning design from P2 onwards, it would seem natural that participants would use the provided framework, at least in some capacity. Despite this, the evolving use of this documentation, the variations in its use, and the interpersonal interactions surrounding it merit further attention due to the diversity, evolution, and fundamental importance of GDP use at this interpersonal scope. -->


INSERT SHORTER VIGNETTE OF SUSANNA AND T HERE.

Vignette 2 (V2.a) observes parent, indicated by (p), Susanna(p)'s use of a tutorial to address the goal of implementing her child's chosen GDPs. Susanna, who is limited in her programming skills but who avoiding seeking facilitator help (see V2.b), leverages the concept of GDPs, to independently access written step-by-step instructions. Tehillah(c)'s choice over which GDPs they tackle has helped create a personal connection to the game, see Tehillah's positive reaction in the vignette above in her signing of the name of the key and door pattern.

NOTES  - MAKE THE LINK CLEARER BETWEEN USE OF GDP AND POSITIVE AFFECT.
V11 - WAS THE MAPS ONE-

<!-- OTHER DATA  HERE - Other examples include,
Examples from the data of participants using GDPs as a framework for organisation and project navigations. -->

While the evidence supports the potential of a menu of GDPs to address the tensions between choice-based approaches and the danger of a lack of relevant scaffolding, there are some important clarifications to make at this point. Firstly, not all participants engage with this menu. For example, in Vignette 3 (V3.a), Ed lets his father take the lead in accessing documentation. Other individuals lear to implement GDPs from peers, a process explored in later section. Secondly, becase the GDP menu (and concepts) were introduced by myself as navigational and organisational tool for use by participants, it seems logical that participant should use the for that purpose. The danger here is of circular reasoning in methodology which could impact the validity of claims here. Despite these clarification the data clearly shows the utility of the menu of GDP to directly help some participants, as a valid application of just in time documentation principles and as a foundational source later propagation and evolution of GDP practices by participants.

<!-- In addition, this process of using GDPs in this way was also discovered via an exploratory DBR approach, and thus its introduction is also significant and cannot be divorced from the aspect of participant reaction. Additionally, the potential of GDPs as a germ cell concept (as explored in Chapters 3 and 5) is explored in greater depth in the following chapter. -->

<!-- NOTE ARE DIFFERENT APPROACHES BEST EXPLORED HERE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE? -->

<!--

<!-- In addition, Direct help between peer participants, as outlined other section, was a key process of the game making comshowed the child sharing an independent style with Susanna butmunity from early stages.
However, to overcome scarcity of facilitator support, direct help processes were seeded by other forms of support resources and written documentation. -->

<!-- The timings of the process of patching the code show that the learner is hesitant in the process. He checks the code and then checks the game output to test that the code creates the desired behaviour. Once this is verified he progresses to copy and paste the code from the create function of the sample code to the create function of his own source code. -->


<!-- NOTE - PERHAPS INTEGRATE PART OF THE CODE PATCHING PROCESS FOR THIS SECTION -->

<!-- Towards the end of phase 1 I began to create code examples to illustrate of how particular commonly requested game features were implemented. These barebone game projects were hosted on a code playground. An online document in our shared google drive working space linked to these examples. I would help participants access this when they requested a certain feature. This list of game features began to grow. For phase one these code example were not particularly successful at increasing learner independence. There were differences in the code structure of their games and the examples and translation was not intuitive. -->

### GDPs used to scaffold ideation and prioritisation processes


<!-- Other techniques that leveraged the characteristics of game design patterns to support the ideation process emerged in community design activities. -->
<!-- NOTE - ADD MORE ON GESTURING  -->


Addressing the tension between participant choice and scaffolding via menu of GDPs, my journal notes on the shift from P1 to P2, I noted that the provision of this menu of GDPs significantly decreased in time spent in the ideation phase by providing scaffolding and restricting choice. Beyond this immediate impact, this section outlines how the use of GDP concepts and supporting tools were used in ideation and project organisation, specifically: as a lingua franca, as a visual prototyping tool, and within participant gestural interaction.

Video data surfaced frequently use of GDPs terms as a lingua franca to organise and prioritise game making activity. An exchange from Vignette 3 between participants Ed and Mark shows the use of GDP concepts to help resolve a tension between a more chaotic style of working jumping from one goal to another and a parental motivation to prioritise work. The pair's initial listing of features is a brainstorming technique using the approximate names of game design patterns (_get the person animated_, _get an enemy in_, _changing the platforms_, _make a theme tune_). The vignette analysis sees the parent _overwhelmed_ with the child's lack of focus on one pattern "_that’s what I mean, you can’t just skip around like that_."


<!-- THIS IS MORE ON A COMMUNITY LEVEL - AND TECHNICAL PERHAPS MOVE
In Vignette 5.d, where the parent Madiha wants to export an image from the graphical editing tool and to import this into the game, shows an evolving use of some of the terminology that has been introduced partly by facilitator interventions and partly emerging organically through community interaction. the terms here are used first to request help, and then to discuss emerging community norms. -->

<!-- OTHER DATA ON GDP AS LINGUA FRANCA AT VARIOUS STAGES. -->
<!-- In this interaction above which was used to illustrate Madiha and Nasrin's division of labour, the parent is focused on completing the action of creating a graphical asset of a hazard as part of the activity of adding the GDP of including a hazard into the game. -->

<!-- Mark: I’ve brought the music, and also we could just concentrate on one thing and just change that. You know, keep working through.
Ed: Yeah. I think I want to get an enemy in - oh no - my person animated.
Mark: So you want to get your person animated that’s the main thing.
Mark: Shall we concentrate on that and changing the platforms into something different? -->

In the vignette extract below, home-based knowledge of GDP mechanics is utilised on an interpersonal plane, with Dan(p) helping Toby(c) via guided facilitation to provoke and shape new design ideas. Dan(p) draw on the game playing experiences to promote innovation in the design of the existing template: _"the previous style of game was a platform (makes shape with hands) game wasn't it? You went along and there was gravity pushing down. There are other types of games aren't there?"_ The pair use their knowledge of game play patterns and genre conventions to break out of the genre constraints of starting template.  Here they are charting new territory beyond the curated choices of GDPs and as such may not have vocabulary to express concepts. Both Dan and Toby make extensive use of gestures in their interaction reinforces their spoken references to GDP concepts.


INSERT DAN AND TOBY EXTRACT HERE.


later in the same session (see V7.12-16), Toby uses the code based tilemap tool to design a maze game instead of a platformer game drawing on existing knowledge of tools and home knowledge of the target game genre to rapidly make revisions without extensive planning. This use of GDPs to allow the spacial exploration of design in a visual and intuitive way suits being mapped onto paper, or onto graphical software which allows for a similarly rapid prototyping. By way of contrast, other pairs take advantage of paper prototyping. For example, Susanna(p) notices the child's difficulty in using cursor and delete/backspace keys to edit a matrix allowing level design. The parent provides a book with grid paper to allow the child to replicate the matrix. The parent is then able to transcribe the design to the code example while engaging the child by checking she has interpreted the design correctly. Interview data with Mark and Ed uncovers complexities in the use of both digital and paper prototyping of related to GDPs explored in more detail in Appendix.tech.prototyping. WHY IMPORTANT?

### GDPs aiding the process of division of labour (1400)

CHECK FOR OVERLAP-->

<!-- NOTE  dol and identities.
Skills to perform these activities were at often distributed between different family members. For some adult re-enforcing their identities as project managers, and for young participants forming identities as digital specialists.  -->

Addressing division of labour on an interpersonal plane, participants worked mostly as pairs or individuals, alternating between community playtesting and pair/individual design work. An overarching feature of the use of GDPs at this level, in line with existing research on design patterns [@erickson_lingua_2000, @eriksson_using_2019], was a lingua franca. The use of GDP concepts to construct shared language and understanding was found in video data in varied forms related in particular to division of labour between participants.

In addition, the use of GDPs as an organisational strategy, structuring work processes through implementing modular sub-projects in the form of GDPs can aid division of labour. GDPs feature in processes division of labour in a variety of ways: working knowledge of different types of GDPs can help participants to divide work by working on different patterns or taking on project elements within patterns.

The examples below illustrate part of some of the varied strategies to divide labour adopted by participants at times involving complex tensions in activity. Data uncovered  ways in which the participant divided the process of game making, in ways which uncovered traces of home collaboration practices. For example, In Vignette 2, Susanna(p) and Tehillah(c) relied on the parent to do the majority of code implementation but shared one computer. The parent took a lead on many activities but took care that they alternated between use of keyboard and mouse to give the child hands on experience when possible, particularly in level design activities and playtesting (see V2.7). In interview data (see V2.b), the parent notes _"I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles."_  In another exchange (see), Tehillah (c) uses the name of a GDP within a request for her parent to take on a specific task within their making process, "Go on then. Key-Door person." When the parent expresses confusion Tehillah gestures with her hands to indicate that her mother is the person she is referring to. The child appears to consider the level of complexity needed to add a new pattern into the code to be beyond her ability and thus directly delegate the task to her mother. At times Susanna(p) asked Tehillah(c) to seek help from facilitator (V2.1). On another occasion when the child appeared bored of waiting for parent to solve a code problem, she approached the facilitator to ask for help on behalf of the adult without prompting. At other times Tehillah(c) engages more peripheral activities such as watching older children playtest each others games, or observing community activity from under the table.

Madiha's(p) family Nasrin(c) and Zidane(c) are all working on separate games on different computers. While Madiha sits next to Zidane who needs closer support, Nasrin often sits close by but next to a friend. In Vignette 5, as part of her process of building an emerging identity as a graphical asset designer (see V5.b), Madiha calls across the room to draw on Nasrin's help to correct a design mistake. Nasrin affects reluctance in her support of her mother (see V5.a), but at other times shows that she enjoys her status of technical supporter (see V5.d). Nasrin appears reluctant to explain the technical processes she uses to help her mother:  

*"Madiha (to Nasrin): What are you doing? You have to tell me what you are doing so I can do it myself."* This may be driven by a desire to preserve this specialist status and utility to her mother. Madiha and Nasrin reversed the traditional helping relationship, and the child would reluctantly implement the parent's requested technical elements of GDPs but would pointedly not explain the changes made, seemingly taking pride in knowing something that her mother didn't.



<!-- (CHECK INTERVIEW DATA) -->

<!-- Toby and Dan's pair process of accessing professional documentation also illustrated an aspect of their family learning culture.  -->



Toby adopts different working arrangements dependent on which family members he attends with. While in P2 when supported by grandparents Toby had worked mostly alone (see V1), in P3, he works as a pair with his father (Dan) in closely guided practice (see V7.b). In several interchanges, the father starts as a facilitator, taking a lead from the direction of the child. As the child reaches the limits of their ability, he begins to be more directive, by asking leading questions and testing existing knowledge. Finally, in order to complete the programming or research tasks beyond the child's knowledge, the father is more direct in instruction, directing the research and proposing a coding solution for their new game design pattern. Dan's experience as a software engineer and volunteer at Coder Dojo (see glossary) is relevant as a fund of knowledge he draws on (see V7.a and later section).



<!-- **Leveraging the possibilities of emerging divisions of labour** -->

While the context of the participants as families involved in home education makes any general claims difficult, these observations support findings in other research in this domain. For example, research shows that children have the potential to help parents as technology brokers [@correa_brokering_2015]. In joint technology work, parents can fulfil several reciprocal roles including collaborator, resource provider, learner, non-technical consultant, and emotional support [@barron_parents_2009].

Thus, in response to the creative support that parents and siblings provide, facilitators should design learning environments to facilitate these possibilities. The work of Roque provides guidance for helpers in the process to support parents to value and feel confident in these roles [@roque_im_2016] in a way which mirrors the use of helpers in this phase of my study (see Chapter 4).






The variety of repertoires of helping practice depends in part on the different funds of knowledge the parent has access to. The helping pattern of researching and accessing technical documentation is not available to all pairs, due to the level of skill and experience involved

Toby and Dan's pair process is more guided and focused than many other participants and includes accessing professional documentation and exploration of computational thinking concepts.



While Tehillah's activity away from the screen  while non-productive within the scope of technical progress, can be characterised as legitimate peripheral activity of observation of community activity [@lave_situating_1991 ; @rogoff_learning_2014].  Indeed the possibility for children to _not_ engage in community activities is seen by Rogoff [-@rogoff_cultural_2003; -@rogoff_organization_2016] as an important characteristics in participation based models of learning.

In Vignette 3 (V3.a), Mark(p) repeatedly steers Ed(c) to pick one GDP to allow them to carefully work through the associated documentation together, a process he later refers to in interview data (Interview ) as _plodding_ . Early in that session Mark takes a significant amount of time puzzling over documentation on how to add animation to a character. This results in Ed being blocked from progressing and to address this tension child proposes dividing their labour and workig on two separate computer (see V3.9 _"Why don’t you go there for a computer and you can do that?"_). Ed appears to make a tactical decision allowing the father to specialise in GDPs that involve deciphering technical instructions, whilst he engages with a pattern that involves creating audio and graphical assets in a less technical, more exploratory process.

MOVED - INTEGRATE IN
In Vignette 3 (see 3.c in particular), we see Ed(c) break out of the more restrictive approach of plodding that Mark(p) advocated for to engage in experimental, improvised design processes with no clear end goal. Mark (p) later joins in Ed(c)'s exploration of sound-making software. They start a process of tinkering and messing about with the capability of music-making tools in a way that spurs creativity. In this case, the joint improvised process sparks a new proposal to incorporate the two soundtracks they create in distinct levels.

<!-- While these following observations are more generally inked to the overall design process rather than the specific note they are of value to RQ2 on developing agency. -->

<!-- Nasrin uses the mouse to select the grey background colour with the colour picker tool, then the pen tool to fill in gaps in the design. She then swaps the active colour back from grey to black by clicking the option to swap foreground and background colours.

<!-- The parent cedes the keyboard and mouse and sometimes swaps chairs to allow child to play test the game created.  -->

<!-- At one point the testing process Susanna shows frustration as gravity value is very low making any movement very slow with little control.

## Use of GDPs in the cultural plane / community level of activity

Continuing the three planes approach to analysis [@rogoff_observing_1995], the following section explores the use of GDPs at the community plane of activity. Rogoff's [-@rogoff_observing_1995] initial analysis of activity on a cultural plane focused on existing communities emphasising the metaphor of apprenticeship. In later later work with Gutiérrez [@gutierrez_cultural_2003], there is a greater work on places greater emphasis on cultural activity as dynamic. This perspective examines existing and emerging norms and repertoires, adapted from participants’ engagement in other communities and contexts. Gutiérrez [-@gutierrez_developing_2008] continued this line of reasoning to advance the concept of third spaces in education as a space where the repertoires of the repertoires of home meet and can mix with those of more formal schooling. This section explores the findings of existing and emerging cultural activity within this conceptual framework.

### The role of GDPs to facilitate learners to design for others

The use of GDPs, particularly during playtesting, can support the process of imagining end-user experiences. This section examines how the concept of, and experience with, implementing GDPs encouraged participants to envision the experience of end users of their games. Chapter 2 explored the proposition from professional and participatory design processes that design should be informed by end-user experience [@redstrom_towards_2006], as well as the challenges involved in undertaking such an *"operationalization of empathy"* [@surma-aho_conceptualization_2022, p.1]. From a CHAT interpretation, this process involves shifts in perspective by participants as they engage with objectives across different scopes of activity.

In the extract of Vignette 2, Tehillah (c) pursues a quirky design goal during her paired design work, which Susanna (p) resists. Imagining a shift in perspective to the intended audience at a community level of interaction, the parent aims to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player.

Susanna(p)'s alarm at the child's deletion of all elements of hazard shows she has a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. "It's no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid." However, Tehillah (c) seems determined to remove all hazards. *"It is for me!"* she counters. My understanding is that she is may be aware of the implications for game balance but takes pleasure in this destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play. A later interaction with a peer shows that Tehillah (child) is indeed imagining the experience of the audience. *"I like making it frustrating. That other people find it frustrating!"* Tehillah (child) notes the persistence of a student helper who pushes past her frustration to complete the game. Her remark, *"If people tried hard they would get to my level,"* shows her awareness that not all players will persist in the same way to reach her final level, which has only rewards and no hazards. This being a *"secret, special"* experience, which plays against the norms of platform game design, is thus intended to provoke player surprise.

In contrast other participants created extremely challenging or impossible game levels that frustrated other players.


This examples serve to highlight two dimensions of the use of GDP concepts to facilitate the process of designing for others. The first is the influence of making in a cultural setting where regular playtesting by peers occurs on the making process. The second is through either direct advice by pair partners and peers in playtesting to imagining others' user experience, or indirectly by gameplay feedback or suggesting alterations to GDP implementations. This research is in line with the interpretation within computer supported collaborative learning of the value of the  of tangible, public digital products as both a motivating and focusing factor in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) [@xambo_experience_2017; @fields_programmers_2015]. The results here are valuable as a contribution help address a deficit of results in the use of CSCL to support computer programming [@silva_computer-supported_2020].

### GDPs can facilitate the use of wider funds of knowledge and interest

<!-- THIS NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE GROUNDED IN DATA - MOVE THEORY OUT -->

Existing research outlines the motivations for social making incorporating cultural knowledge of gaming within non-formal making activities [@ito_hanging_2010; @gee_what_2003]. Similarly, the ability to make personalised game assets and narratives and sustain engagement in digital making projects [@sefton-green_mapping_2013].

Existing constructivist research in CGD&P also highlight the motivating potential of incorporating home interests in games, coding and media projects [@resnick_mothers_2012; @papert_mindstorms:_1980]; @kafai_constructionist_2015


Cocio-cultural research on the tactical use of FoK to overcome barriers to technical environments [@gutierrez_learning_2019-1; @moje2001maestro].

Research related to project based learning (PBL) benefits of working with participants' home interests with project work include to motivate participants in initial stages [@swirski_does_2018-1; @penuel_connecting_2022], sustain activity and overcome problems in order to share the personalised object created [@barron_conceptualizing_2010; @barron_interest_2006-1].


In Chapter 5 and Appendix.tech.gameframework I outlined the use of the MDA (mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics) framework to theme the presentation of GDPs.
In the following section I use the MDA themes to explore different examples of use of funds of knowledge and interest by participants.

![Illustration 6.x -  MDA as an additional framework promoting multiple means of engagement - mapped to an grouping of GDPs  ](./Pictures/ch_6_mda_dia_2.png){width=95%}

PERHAPS CHANGE THE GRAPHIC TO A TABLE HERE.
DVELOP THIS A BIT OR LINK TO ANOTHER BIT EXPLORING THIS


Some participants focused their game making on the aesthetics of their projects. Madiha in the vignette extract above show identification (as an _expert pixel_) with the graphical-making process. Many examples of session data (see Vignette 5) confirm this preference for both Madiha(p) and her daughter Nasrin(c) and interview data shows that this art is also an interest that they pursue at home. Beyond their internal family interaction, the process of bringing that aspect of creativity into their games allows them to share this artistic flair and attention to detail with the emerging learning community. In another example, Mark and Ed designed a game around the character of a train driver that needed to collect coal. In interview data Mark describes the impact of the child feeling like they could bring their own identity and interest into the project. "I know just your eyes lit up when you realised you could expand your interests into gaming." (see Appendix 4.x). Clive(p) and Pearl(p), the grandparents of Toby(c), included a narrative message at the start of their game surfacing the interest and expertise of the family as beekeepers (see Vignette 6) in a way that sparked interest and conversations with other participants.


Addressing game dynamics, Vignette 4 gives several examples of participant feedback on the dynamics of Madiha's game in the level of the challenge experienced by players. Community norms of gameplay began to develop, some of which were influenced by home experience of game playing.  The discussion of game challenge, specifically comments about how 'hard' participant games were, was a particularly common interaction during playtesting. Vignette 4 (V4.a) outlines the community norming of Madiha(p)'s game to conform to expected standards of a platform game. The vignette shows varied attempts to influence Madiha to change the game variables to make controlling her player avatar less frustrating.  The indirect norming behaviours described in Vignette 4 mirror observations seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues [@rogoff_cultural_2003] on learning in community settings.


Turning to the area game mechanics, In see V1.b Bertie(c) comments on Toby(c)'s game, which has a dominant game experience of timed jumping: *"It’s like parkour in Minecraft but timed. It’s like playing the game Wipeout. Have you ever played Wipeout?"*. Parkour in Minecraft and Wipeout are both game experiences whose main gameplay mechanic is about judging jumps and landing accurately. Bertie makes links to his existing experience of games, making comparisons between Toby's game, commercial games, and his own. In doing so, Bertie is able to show his knowledge and analysis of gameplay patterns. Additionally, the guidance of Dan(p) for Toby(c) explored above in Vignette 7, saw the parent explicitly drawing out the child's home knowledge of games to enable an exploration of a different set of game mechanics. Thus, the tacit knowledge of GDPs of children and adults as game players serves them in knowledge-brokers roles in the process of feeding back and ideation [@wenger_communities_1998].

The previous examples have outlined varied was that  participants used GDPs in incorporating elements of home funds of knowledge and interest into their games. I observed that families and individuals those less intrinsically interested in the gaming often engaged with the aesthetics elements of the graphical or audio design or the cast of characters the narrative of the game.




<!-- The MDA framework has been used to  can support novice game makers to explore game elements (moveable game jam). -->


In summary, GDP concepts allow participants to share and explore funds of knowledge and interest [@fasso_identity_2020; @esteban-guitart_funds_2014] related to gaming culture [@ito_hanging_2010; @livingstone_digital_2018] in the emerging learning community. While existing work on computational design patterns by Repenning et al. [-@repenning_scalable_2015] addresses the motivational value of working with known games types, and the patterns as a way of scaffolding the process of programming, it does not address any aspect of choice when of drawing on FoK when creating games.

In contrast, the different types of GDPs available to participants to choose from in the menu of GDP documentation and code snippets allowed for a choice in participant making paths, enabling alignment with home interests. As a contribution this area of research,  I propose that the diversity and subdivision of a menu of GDPs aligned with the MDA framework can help participants to elect to follow varied learning pathways based on their home interests in a way which aligns with characteristics of the inclusive pedagogy [@sanger_inclusive_2020]. Specifically, this is achieved by providing scaffolding and resources which allow exploration of concepts which providing multiple means of engagement with the learning process [@capp_effectiveness_2017].

### The propagation  and evolution of GDPs concepts

<!-- NOTE NOT PLAYTESTING THAT IS IMPORTANT HERE - INSTEAD THE ROLE AND NATURE OF GDPS TO AID PROPAGATION -->
<!-- NOTE THIS includes NON TEMPLATED GDPs? -->

<!-- While GDPs were often demanded by pairs or individuals, and then in P2 a menu of suggested GDPs introduced by had a role, there is a community dimension in the way participants worked with the concepts and the concrete implementation of GDPs.   -->
<!-- In addition to the names of patterns as a lingua franca to comment on games during the process of playtesting, participants also    -->

The implementation of popular or novel GDPs by participant pairs or individuals often spread through peer activity. Both documented (those part of provided resources) and novel GDPs (those introduced by participants) were transmitted between participants, enriching the games of participants. At times, participants were influenced by playing the games of others, and at times, they would request the direct help of peers to implement GDPs in their own games.


<!-- Other examples of propagating patterns include placing hazards in tricky places like a lava pit, the use of moving enemies and changes to jump dynamics. -->


<!-- EVIDENCE? PRESENCE / FREQUENCY?   -->
<!-- NOTE ADD MORE EVIDENCE? -->

<!-- A different pattern of propagation was that participants notice and comment on a game element or pattern during during playtesting, and then to use supporting resources or facilitator help to implement it. A less frequent pattern involved participants' diligent and deliberate use of supporting resources to identify and implement features without peer influence. -->

<!-- **New GDPs emerged from existing patterns through peer activity during playtesting** -->
<!-- DEVELOP -->

In Vignette 1b, Toby's work adding 21 levels to his game is noticed by Bertie who then asks Toby, _"Can you show me how you add more levels onto yours?"_ The full exchange shows an example of the propagation of GDPs emerging from the process of community playtesting through a direct request. It is possible that Bertie's request to Toby is prompted by Bertie noticing Toby helping Nasrin and Harper add levels to their games. Toby's emerging role as a specialist that the community can draw on for practical help, and similar examples (see also that of Nasrin in Vignette 5), were welcomed by me as a way to reduce dependence on myself as a facilitator, or to provide an alternative to the instruction-based support documents.


Turning to evolution of patterns, the concept of a safe zone in the game of Pearl and Clive arrived as a direct result of adding many _moving enemies_ in a way that it became essential for players to quickly identify and use 'safe zones' where enemies did not reach. This novel  concept, became used as lingua franca in the playtesting of that game and that of others with moving enemies. Once concepts like safe zone or bonus level enters the linguistic and coding repertoire of this community of game makers, either from documentation, home gaming knowledge or genuine innovation,  it became available for propagation for take up by other participants.


The data shows other examples of organic emergence of novel GDPs and related design concepts  beyond those offered in the menu of supporting documentation. Tehillah's concept of a kind of bonus level that eschews challenge and offers only rewards (see Vignette 2) emerged through playful experimentation. While this idea exists in popular games, it was experimental and novel for the child.

In contrast other participants created extremely challenging or impossible game levels that frustrated other players.

DEVELOP THIS OR MOVE
They seem to take pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context. The process mirrors play theory concept of playing against the game or dark play [@sutton-smith_ambiguity_2001].

The preferences shown by some for peer learning and convention breaking became a part of the emerging culture of the game making sessions.

**GDPs as components of emerging repertoires in an evolving idioculture**

The term idioculture [@cole_design-based_2016], a local, non-geographical, non-demographic community where culture emerges via valued behaviours [@lecusay_telementoring_2015], can be applied to the role of GDPs as component parts in the emergence of a community culture.

Aspects of idioculture stemming from GDP use have already been described above, in aspects of peer learning, use of home interests, etc.

**evolving culture of playfulness and social interaction**  
To creating a relaxed environment I led by warm up games at the start of sessions in P1 regularly and at the start of P2. Regular playtesting which was open in scope allowed for natural play to emerge. For many younger participants, the game making time involved may playful interactions and was an important, perhaps even primary, motivation to attend.
Playtesting was also used as a social time for adults, conversations about x and y.

<!-- The playful elements of the revised process with greater playtesting time helped remove system tensions and moreover introduced system congruencies. -->



LINK
This section is short as this aspect is explored in more depth in Chapter 7.
These examples are emerging process where cultural concepts are mutually constituted by different actors involved in the game making activity system. While the concepts of hardness and challenge that emerge and not concrete examples of GDPs used as mediation, rather an examples of blending of users FoK about gaming norms meeting feedback processes. The next chapter explores similar concepts of blending of practices to create new aspects of the emerging idioculture.

<!-- they are the results of changed GDPs. The next chapter explores similar data on the use of GDP related concepts by participants and the resultant potential impact on participant agency. -->


## Discussion

This discussion section discusses the complexity of the exanded object of activity and the diverse mediational uses of GDPs using a 3GAT framework. Bearing in mind the challenge of communicating the diverse motivations and forms of activity involved, it returns to concepts of proximal flow and computational fluency present in CGD&P research to begin an analysis of how this research can contribute to understandings in this domain.


### Addressing the use of GDPs in relation to theoretical understandings of processes of mediation and expanded objects of activity -

This chapter has also addressed the complexity of activity by focusing on the germ cell concept of GDPs used in a variety of ways, a summary of which has been represented in table form at the start of this chapter.

As such a fuller table summarises interpretation of the diverse roles of GDPs in the game-making activity using CHAT concepts. The right column lists example behaviours and notes vignettes or appendices where the behaviour can be found in situ with more detailed analysis.

Chapter 5, via a design narrative of the pedagogical design used, exposed tensions where existing mediational strategies or tools were insufficient, and thus innovative forms of mediation were needed.


INSERT TABLE HERE.

The examples in this table show GDPs are used in diverse ways by participants, peers and facilitators, as principle or supporting parts of mediational strategies including as as a lingua franca, as a motivational element, or as a way of structuring the learning experience and supporting resources.   

The findings expose complex activity which presents challenges in terms of graphical representation using 3GAT methods. The uses of GDPs within the quick-start activities, tutorials, and code snippets as supporting tools, if viewed in isolation, can be seen as a triangular form of mediation involving subject, tool, and object mediation .

![Figure 6.x - Diverse mediational strategies and complex object of activity  ](./Pictures/ch_6_at_dia_2.png){width=95%}

While this diagram helps represent a general picture of the pattern mediation it may be too general to be useful. In particular, there is complexity in terms of the role of GDPs here which act sometimes as mediational strategies and at other times as motivational components of the object at hand. In addition, it fails to communicate interplay with community level of activity and wider systems.

Given the complexity of the expanded object and it would be unwieldy to try to represent in a 3GAT diagram form. As Engestrom noted in discussing challenges of representing new generations of AT, you can't keep adding triangles.

At the larger scale, (see Figure.5.x) the activity system of games code and process can be seen as a boundary objects. Additionally, each game instance, can also be interpreted as a boundary object for complex, and expanded interacting processes of activity. Take for example findings showing participant draw some of their home gaming knowledge of GDPs  in varied ways in the new setting including: goal formation, as a lingua franca in design processes, and to provide feedback in playtesting.

PATCHED IN HERE - MERGE UP

To end this section, it is of value to link this use of GDP terminology and visual prototyping techniques to existing research on the development of shared language to support joint work and guided participation. While much research on teaching coding addresses the benefits of collaborative approaches (see Chapter 2), fewer studies outline strategies to facilitate such joint attention [@brennan_scratch-ed_2009]. The work of Stahl and others [@stahl_computer-supported_2006] within the fields of technology use and collaborative learning is relevant here to highlight the importance of language development and the intersubjective interpretation of visual prototypes and gestures as tools in building mutual understanding in the kind of _joint problem space_ we see in this study. Returning to Kynigos's interpretation of the half-baked game as a boundary object facilitating communication [@kynigos_half-baked_2007], we can locate the diverse forms of GDPs as such _boundary objects_ at a scope of greater granularity.


### Discussion of GDPs not aligning with design cycles MERGE WITH BELOW?

A possible existing framework on CGD&P to address the process of organising or scaffolding guided participation is that of design cycles. However, observations of participant design behaviour did not align with common design thinking concepts or advocated in design cycle frameworks [@resnick_all_2007; @winarno_steps_2020-1; @dam_5_2024]. The stages were instead fragmented and sometimes happened in parallel. In many interactions, I observed improvisational approaches which incorporated ideation, planning, implementation, and testing in the space of a minute or so. As typified in vignette 1 and 5, some younger participants, in particular, developed impressively fluid practices, demonstrating extremely rapid shifts between code editing, game testing, authoring assets in online tools, and migrating files, often while talking with peers. Some older participants also showed rapid, responsive creativity. Grandad Clive quickly incorporated a boost to player health after a level after being given feedback during playtesting. If I had encouraged participants to follow prescribed design stages, this may have restricted this flexibility in practice [@kuby_rhizomatic_2016].

NOTE REFERENCE TO PLODDING MOVED

Other pairs often adopted a similar spirit of collaborative improvisation. In V7 Dan(p) makes a suggestion - "Use paper to design?" - to which Toby(c) replies, "I'm just going with it."

These examples and many observations in this chapter show a variety of ways that GDPs assist  division of labour, and
Thus, rather than design cycles a more flexible understanding is needed.


### Expanded object in terms of motivation - fluency towards agency

<!-- NOTE To restructure. -->


Given the complexity of the object being worked on in this research, and the disparate  sometimes chaotic nature of the emerging activity, [@biffi_chasing_2017-1; @de_freitas_classroom_2012; @cormier2008rhizomatic],  it is of value to return to existing research on CGD&P in terms of goal formation and motivation in a way which invites discussion on how best to conceptualise the diversity of motivational aspects and resulting impact on diverse goal formation ( & flexible design practices) present in the findings of this chapter.

One of these motivational factors is remaining engaged or in flow.
Flow theory in my guiding motivations in terms of participant experience [@perttula_flow_2017]. As a facilitator, my design decisions were often guided by the desire to not detract from participant experience of flow, and thus their coding fluency and engagement in and identification with the overall game-making process. The experience of flow is also a component of the concept of fluency in technology use explored in Chapter 2 in varied forms within constructionist research, technological, digital and computation. The guiding principle being technical proficiency with the relevant technology to share interests and identity within a community of peers. It is of value to now identifying manifestations of such fluency and identify the techniques used to design for this behaviour via in the mediational uses of GDPs outlined in this chapter. In other words, what can be observed about the interaction of participants use of GDPs and the experience of participant fluency?

<!-- , and to surface additional socio-cultural concepts useful for an enriched understanding of processes as play.   -->
**Fluency and fluidity in practice**

Younger participants in particular developed impressively fluid practice demonstrating extremely rapids shifts between code editing, game testing, authoring assets in online tools and migrating files often while talking with peers. Older participants also showed rapid, responsive creativity. Above Toby's increased navigational proficiency was interpreted as  transformation of actions into more fluent operations [@leontiev_activity_2009].

Clive quickly incorporated a boost to player health after a level after being given feedback during playtesting. In exploring sound making software Ed and Mark start a process of tinkering and messing about with the capability of the tools which spurs creativity. The joint improvisation created two different soundtracks. This sparks a new proposal to incorporate different soundtracks for different levels. Pairs often adopted a similar spirit of improvisation. For example parent Dan makes a suggestion - "Use paper to design?" - to which Toby replies "I'm just going with it."

In Chapter 2 the value of a learning design using computational thinking patterns was explore through the concept of proximal flow [@basawapatna_zones_2013], with reponsive just in time documentation aligned with participants goal shown to be more engaging than principles based instruction. This research extends this technique by adding greater specificity in detail of use of patterns and most importantly choice of which patterns participants implement. The user-led process can be examined increased the experience of flow through possibilities for social identity development [@mao_optimal_2016].


**limitation of fluency as a concepts**

Returning to the gaps in research outline in Chapter 2 in regarding CGD&P

The limitations here are on detail on how to enact identity formation via specific pedagogical strategies. While Chapter 2. explored the value of pair and peer programming, it also highlighted this area as one needed further development.

The work of the constructionist school is rich in a legacy of designing for fluency, notably including: software microworlds, affordance rich tools sets facilitating open-ended experimentations, accessible multi-media authoring software and community of Scratch. One idea which while present in part in online community of Scratch is that of constructopedia, an evolving resource of inspirational design elements, and accompanying instructions.

In addition, while the concept flow is well established in socio-cultural research, the more specific concept of technological fluency are less explored. Given its wider scope within CHAT, in Chapter 7 characterics and processes associated with fluency in this chapter are analysed using the lens of agency, in particular that of relational agency.

<!-- NOTE - IS THIS IN THE NEXT CHAPTER? is this just in relation to GDPs? -->



<!-- The collection of GDPs with linked documentation fulfils this role.    

To extend the concepts of designing for fluidity, it is of value to explore the characteristics of the emerging design practices and potential strategies to support them. These include: a flexible approach to design stages, varied forms of incorporation of external repertoires, and a tension between choice of participant pathway and creative restrictions in the learning design. -->

## Conclusion

On a theoretical plane, this chapter has outlined the evolving use of GDPs as a meditational strategy to develop coding repertoires that are often shared. CHAT frames diverse use of shared resources and concepts, in this case GDPs, as meditational strategies.

On a cultural plane, using GDPs can aid the propagation of technical and social processes game making practices within an emerging community of learners. GDPs served both researchers and participants by _providing a common language_ to clarify first learner expression and researcher's analysis of gameplay experience.

The observations of this chapter show the diversity and flexibility of uses of GDP as an mediational tool.
The next chapter builds on this to propose the potential of GDPs as a relatable navigational framework, occupying a the space between too concrete to be repeated and too theoretical to be grasped by novice game makers.

The findings identified a complex object with a diversity of motivation which pose challenges in communicating in simple terms in terms of what characteristics we are designing learning environments to develop. The candidates of proximal flow and computational fluency were explored in relation to existing research and gaps were identified in there coverage of the importance of learning agency and identify formation.

As such in the next chapter, this gap is addressed via the socio-cultural framing of learning.

<!-- In line with Sannino [@sannino_transformative_2022], this study frames such innovation within CHAT as transformational agency, a discussion of which forms a significant part of the following chapter. -->


<!-- By way of contrast, Gutiérrez's [@gutierrez_developing_2008] focus on the movement of identity between settings' repertoires of practice draws on the importance of a wider cultural focus of the learning process, or the “cultural mediation of thinking” (Moll, 1998), cited in [@digiacomo_seven_2017] p.44. Gutiérrez sees a role for facilitators to facilitate this via learning design. In this chapter, the last section examining activity on the cultural plane exposed elements of transfer between different activity systems, supporting Gutiérrez's [@gutierrez_developing_2008] perspective regarding the importance of transcending borders and linguistic practices between sites of learning. -->

<!-- Several of the observations in vignettes described above, especially those involving interpersonal guided participation, detail the interweaving of novel concepts and practices with existing repertoires. An example being the use of visual prototyping explored above and in more detail in appendix.prototyping. -->



<!-- This section synthesises my observations on video data and my own journal reflections on this topic of designing for flow. Flow is a highly subjective experience, and as such, there is a danger that I privilege my own interests in this analysis, and a tendency that I reflect on in the concluding chapter. -->


<!-- REMOVE OR MOVE TO LR IF NEEDED.
Given the disparate nature of the features of designed and emerging pedagogy, it is of value to address ways of conceptualise the overall learning process. While the chaotic directions possible in design evoke a rhizomatic approach to learning [@biffi_chasing_2017-1; @de_freitas_classroom_2012; @cormier2008rhizomatic], I concur with Biffi et al [ @biffi_chasing_2017-1, p. 972] who identify significant competencies required which are not well-aligned with the age group of this context.  -->

When coding I observed that naturalistic practice rarely matched the progression of the design cycle.  -->

<!-- One potentially fruitful perspective is that of rhizomatic design approaches [@de_freitas_classroom_2012]. Research exists on the promise of rhizomatic approaches design thinking in creative educational programmes [@biffi_chasing_2017-1]. However researchers identify significant competencies required including to "identify and synthesize the body of technical and even complex knowledge into a feasible structure" [@biffi_chasing_2017-1, p. 972], which are not well-aligned with the age group of this context. -->

<!-- This concern is echoed in research which critiques a similar, staged approach to creative writing in primary education using a writing cycle approach.   -->

<!-- This section discusses some of the outcomes stemming from interventions and emergent participant responses in the area of peer and individual working practices. -->

<!-- In Chapter 5, one of area of contractions was the dysfunctional group work which was freed up by allowing greater atomisation and greater scaffolding of tool use. -->

<!-- Some barriers stemming from alienation from participant group working processes were resolved partly by freeing up some patterns of collaboration and interaction and removing others.

The process of parents getting in the way of children's not minding jumping in and invading social space struck me. Together with the frustrations of complexities of larger group work the restrictions created a tension between the suggested community norm of how division of labour was organised.

Thus in P2, rather than the larger groups of P1, smaller groups, allowing some children to work by themselves and others with parents. Avoiding large group fragmentation and encouraging freedom of participation vs benefiting from parental involvement.

There is a flexibility here which is encouraged by informal moments of  playtesting

These tensions are mirrored in similar research and were highlighted in the practitioner interviews that I conducted.

A theme to follow up in the Maps / personal learning chapter is that of picking up on some of the behaviour of participants, especially that of experienced parents, experience either in coding practices of supporting their children. Once identified, how could beneficial interactions be encouraged in the next iteration of design.

Examples include;
- supporting reflection on design and coding concepts / skills.
- navigation / organisational support - use of a physical map.

For example, the use of CT concepts in a framework, listed as part of the initial design pattern card, which 17th Jan 2025 - Supervisions Notescould then be discussed, ticked off or otherwise reflected on. -->

<!-- The observations of this chapter show the advantages of GDP as an intermediate, relatable design framework, occupying a the space between too concrete to be repeated and too theoretical to be grasped by novice game makers.  -->



<!-- The use of GDP concepts can create a tangible link between concrete player experience and the affordances of a guided creative process. Learners use of GDP as relatable and flexible constructs that facilitate communication, sustaining engagement, planning and division of labour.  -->




<!-- **What are the limits of the claims of this research?** It is important to recall the purpose and limitation of these figures outlined in Chapter 4, that this is not designed to claim efficacy of the learning design or to be representative of an average participant (which would require follow up studies of different design). -->


<!-- NEXT CHAPTER?  The utility of a patterns and their collection as a form _intermediate-level knowledge_ by both researchers and participants  is shown in part by in a growing sense of mastery towards technical processes becoming second nature and the resulting ability to share them with family and other peer groups. -->

<!-- **Theoretical** -->


<!-- While the development of agency has not been the primary focus of this chapter, the processes of community adaptation of GDP use can be directly linked to conceptions of transformative agency explored in Chapter 4. The next chapter explores cultural aspects in greater detail continuing to explore emergent agency in this research. -->

<!-- **Transition to next chapter on agency** -->

<!-- Examples of this dynamic agency include the use of graphical code structures, asking for peer or facilitator support etc. -->
<!-- While the process of direction may be less totally learner-driven approach than the first iteration of the learning design P1, working with a starting menu of game patterns with support still provides challenges to learners and complexity of working processes. Design blockages still occur, and participants have to work with facilitators in depth to overcome issues. There is the possibility to adapt existing patterns, to add new patterns from outside the curated collection or to shift to new game paradigm requiring a different set of patterns altogether. -->



<!-- THIS PERHAPS IS FOR CONCLUSION? This can be understood in relation to relevant socio cultural theory in the following way, affordences, mutual tool development, FoI, etc. -->



<!-- An alternative take [@perrenet_exploring_nodate-1] looks at abstraction as...
"Abstraction level as a reflection of the so-called processobject duality" -->
<!-- LINK
The process of abstraction is present in a tacit way in the process of actions becoming operations. -->


<!-- In addition, the use of code playground abstracts away complexities of a development environment, and the immediacy of feedback facilitates  fluid and rapid interchange between the code view and resulting web output. -->

<!-- In this context of novice coders in an informal environment it seems appropriate to introduce some levels of reusable practice whilst initially prioritising individual learner engagement and community participation. -->
<!-- Game design patterns contain elements of more abstract and thus repeatable structures thus fulfilling some of the promise transfer offered by advocates of Computational Thinking. This is explored in more depth in the next chapter. -->

 - explores possible drawbacks
 - looks at restricted

 Examples of short cuts include, "get an enemy in", animate player from Ed and Ma's exerpts.

 The advantages of such shortcuts are, as discussed to help with the prioritisation and ideation processes, to facilitate peer propagation of ideas, and potentially to inform debugging and improvements to increase game playability.

 However, there are challenges of the use of such short cuts including;
 - hiding more complex patterns within the name.
 - confusion over use of terms to new comers

 For example the shortcut of a name for a pattern in Ed and Ma's interaction hides a large amount of problems solving which seems "overwhelming" -->

## MOVED FROM INTRODUCTION


<!-- In interpreting the results of this chapter it is of value to explore experiences of participant agency in a way which reflects the mutual development of this design. Thus the intersection of the participant agency and use of GDPs both as introduced and adopted processes will be examined in this chapter. -->

<!-- MOVE TO PERSONAL However, despite the value of a micro approach which includes close analysis of implementation of code structures. -->

<!-- The focus on GDP as unit of analysis is supported in the following observations;

- the frequency of GDP language referring to patterns used by pairs in particular in the process of collaborating on their games
- Through observation of GDPs as a germ-cell being used at different phases / scope of the learning design as it evolved.
-->

<!-- The previous chapter explores how I developed these requests into a set of code examples, instruction tutorials, quick start activities which proposed micro level code modification. While these approaches are  distinct in their pedagogical use, they stemmed from the same germ-cell activity of altering the game through transforming GDPs. -->


<!-- In addition the following aspects of the use of GDPs merit attention in this chapter:

NOTE CHECK THESE WITH THE DISCUSSION CONCLUSION.

- the value of completing something concrete a sense of sustaining achievement.

<!-- #### On GDPs as a concept to help analysis -->
<!-- MOVE TO METHODOLOGY - JUST GET ON WITH IT?
Blunden cites the process of identifying a germ cell of activity as a fruitful process for researchers [FIND]. In addition, Engestrom frames expansive learning as instructive for organisational change. While research is more sparse in the field of educational practice, the principles are frequently applied to classroom practice. -->
<!-- My decision to privilege the implementation of each GDP as the main objective  activity system mirrors choices by other researchers valuing  -->

<!-- CHECK AGAINST METHODOLOGY
tie in conceptts of
- leading activity
- repeated activity / iteration
- rising to the concrete - ie different forms of activity.  -->


<!-- MOVED EARLIER HERE - Check it fits? In the literature review and methodology chapter we examined different interpretations of agency used by researchers using activity theory [@hopwood_agency_2022].  -->

<!-- DROP? We can ask where does knowledge of GDPs in participant come from. Good games communicate their affordances, (in the form of GDPs) to the player without the need for extensive additional documentation [@gee_learning_2005]. This process also communicates GDPs implicitly to players, a process borne out by brainstorming sessions early in the process which say participants listing GDPs or variants of them without explicit guidance in this direction. This  goal setting and implementation using GDP as a base developed into a principle activity of P1 with varied results. -->

<!-- In addition to support their identification of the different elements that make up a game I created a sheet which drew on existing work framework (mechanics, space, goals, etc) to scaffold the process. -->

<!-- This study activity covers a wide spectrum of activity, in other chapters,  design stages involving discussion, planning, implementation and playtesting after each new game element. -->
<!-- THERE IS OVERLAP HERE WITH THE LAST CHAPTER - HOW TO REMOVE THAT AND RETAIN CLARITY ?

Thus in this study activity covers a full spectrum including close analysis of implementation of code structures. However these smaller operations are not worthy of being treated as an activity system in full. WHY MAKE THIS POINT. wHAT IS THE OVERALL MOTIVATION HERE?  -->

#### On GDPs as a germ concept to help practical development -->

<!-- NOTE - removed -  what is the germ cell of the overall game making activity. -->

<!-- around, game mechanics, game space, game polish and game challenges. -->

<!-- LATER?

AT provides a concept of rising to the concrete which invites analysis of how the construct of  GDPs can be be adapted to serve the development of a game making community at different scopes of activity. To illustrate this concept we can use Marx's concept of exchange as a germ-cell for analysis of capitalism.  -->
<!-- The previous chapter described the  key elements of the learning design that were in place by P2 ( remixing from a game template, use of distributed asset creation showcasing and social playtesting).  The shared tools and documentations began to shape goal setting around implementing new features, some where held in common with other groups. -->

### MOVED FROM GUIDED PARTICIPATION

<!-- Patterns and the multiple actions and operations they entail are referred to briefly using short cut names.   -->


<!-- Discussion later or before??? Maps -
GDP are already being used as a way to set goals, track progress and prioritise but the process seems stressful or unsatisfactory. Some kind of support help scaffold this process would be potentially productive. Changes to the emerging 3M design to provide such support are explored in the following chapter. -->


<!--
We can compare this drawn out process with a more rapid prioritisation guided by a parent with more experience in software development. Toby and Dan  are discussing possible features early in the process if ideation.

They thinking of a feature – wrap around like Pac-man
Dave  – Yeah we can do that. Save that for version 1.1
-->

<!-- This pattern completion is mirrored in the work of other pairs. Thus replicating is a kind of participation in an emerging community.
There is also a link made by the parent to previous working practices. Using a paper book to make a sketch of the work to be completed. -->
<!-- These kinds of shifts of activity and cultural practices brought by the participants also feed into the ongoing culture of the game making community. For example the use of paper designs and paper prototyping that for some of the home ed families was a familiar practice was something that I adopted more broadly after observing the families involved. -->

MOVED FROM DISCUSSION
**A tension in use of norming practices and participant choice?**

<!-- MOVE THIS TO NEXT CHAPTER DISCUSSION?
However, as a seeming counterpoint to this growing agency is the norming effects of concepts that gain community currency in playtesting. The repeated attempts by participants to make the jumping mechanic of Madiha less frustrating can be seen as a potential drag on the agency or autonomy of Madiha as a designer. However this may be a false dichotomy. Such norming practices can be seen from a different perspective according to Rogoff, as a productive nudge to get real.
 IS THIS EXPLORED IN THE NEXT CHAPTER? -->

### Future work on abstraction, layers of abstraction GDPs and the MDA framework

**Move to conclusion or appendix? - appendix for now?**

Levels of abstraction and shifting perspectives also exist in formal analysis of game design frameworks [Salen, and MDA].
In the theoretical underpinning, Aesthetics are the first experience of the user, and the designer most closely aligned with mechanics. Could awareness of this their shifts in perspective in relation to this MDA framework be helpful to novices.

Could link between the MDA framework and main areas of GDPs can be used to deepen a possibly profitable connection to professional design lenses theory practices?

This learning design could be a good base to use to answer those questions.

## Impact of Side Missions and Maker Types on playtesting behaviours


#### Reflection on impact on my design process

<!-- Thus my role as a responsive facilitator rather than a instructor was key to this process.  -->
<!-- opens up flexibility in the way learners approach the design processes. -->
<!-- imagined, often in response to community need, by myself, the following emerged from community use. -->
START WITH A NARRATIVE?
My role as a learning designer under went some significant evolution.
As an example the quick start activities created by PGCE students were much more directive than I initially proposed in P1. It is not that the structuring was antithetical to my approach, more that the area was unfamiliar in terms of common heuristics, and the interweaving of gameplay features and underlying code structures.

Observations of and reflections on playtesting in p2, showed that participants still engendered a diversity of experience, from these shared beginnings.

An additional reflection on design is that the playtesting of participants revealed evidence of different motivations driving activity in game making sessions.



### Limitations of observations and careful statements of potential

It is important to highlight several aspects of the limitation of the exploration of maker types and side missions designed to support them.

This work is limited, as are other observations by the limited number of participants,. It is also perhaps guided by my own motivations as a researcher to investigate more messy approaches to learning.

However, given the potential of my observations and the link with existing research in other domains. It is reasonable to propose the processes outlines as a potentially fruitful area for further research. I explore potential dimensions of that research in the concluding chapter.

MoE being one of those directions.




<!-- In early stages the mutual work to produce resources, techniques and practices to share and evaluate these shared elements became a primary focus of my work, just as the implementation of game elements was the focus of the work of participants. -->

<!--
MOVE TO CHAPTER 7

In appendix 5.playertypes, I outline the use of a game to explore different game playing types. I then proposed different making types. I used the question "What kind of game maker are you?" as an indicator to participants that one aim of the project was to create a space where different approaches are possible and celebrated.

![Illustration 4.x - What kind of game maker are you  ](./Pictures/kindofgamemaker.png){width=95%}

To communicate this approach, as well as starting game activity, I incorporated the question into an animation of the resources home page (see illustration 4.x). In P3 the underlying ideas were incorporated into the process drama described in the next section.
 -->

<!-- MOVE THIS CLAIM LATER.
**Claim:** The data in this chapter shows the value and further potential of mixing the more mature techniques of MoE and other process drama techniques with the ethos of game jams. -->


### Emerging use of narratives and graphics which drawing on home funds of knowledge  - AVOID OVERLAP AND CHANGE FOCUS TO AGENCY FROM START

NOT REALLY ONLY TO DO WITH PLAYTESTING.

RECAP WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLORED,
In the previous chapter,



**While the potential to add graphics was a core affordence of the starting processes of the templated game, the process of designing and sharing and the peer commentary on the process emergered as the sessions evolved.**

The literature review outlined the potential of home interests as funds of knowledge, especially informal learning. This learning design provided participants with different ways to input and explore their home interests in the narrative and graphical elements of their created games. For example the choice of game characters allowed the expression of identity. Other designed elements for example audio and graphical effects or written messages added to the overall aesthetic or polish of the game.

Video evidence indicated that conflicts involved between learner expectations and their technical abilities are helped by the use of the starting template. The
constraints of provided game elements and implied narrative structure of the template accelerated the initial creative process.

<!-- (like a  musical style from which to jam from, or provided constraints in a drama process which help guide improvisation.) -->

One pair Clive and Pearl, the grandparents of Toby, included a narrative message at the start of their game. This process surfaced the expertise of the family as beekeepers, sparking interesting conversations with other participants.

     var starttext = "This is a game which pits a honey bee against a swarm of Asian hornets,  which are alien invaders attacking bee  hives in the UK and which beekeepers are trying to stop spreading  here. Try to guide the bee to collect all the flowers without being caught by the hornets.
     Use the arrow keys to move the bee. Press return to START.";

<!-- In a noteworthy exchange a young participant Zi asks one of the grandparents of child if they had done any amazing things in their life. This exchange follows

   zi: Have you done amazing things?

The exchange seems to throw Pa but they draw Zi's attention back to the game. Showing that it demonstrates their interest in bees as they are beekeepers.

The source of Pa's hesitancy to share more is not clear. However her willingness to share that part of her personal story via the narrative of the game is shown here as is the willingness of the young participant to ask about the personal experiences of the older participant during the process of peer testing her game. -->

In another example, Mark and Ed designed a game around the character of a train driver that needed to collect coal. In subsequent post course interview Mark describes the impact of the child feeling like they could bring their own identity and interest into the project. "I know just your eyes lit up when you realised you could expand your interests into gaming." See Appendix 4.x (Mark and Ed working with home interests)

<!-- The process of creating assets builds in Madiha the identity of a proficient maker. She wants to build on her achievement of being an "expert pixel".  -->



<!-- NOTE
NARRATIVE / drama IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER?
how do these two sections work together? remove this one?
 -->
<!-- The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;] BRING ON OTHER LITERATURE HERE ON PERSONAL EXPRESSION, FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA. Roque, Scratch, Kafai, Gee etc. -->

<!-- Ideally look for evidence of sharing in communities, especially developing processes, avoiding traps which sap momentum, -->

<!-- While these aspects are covered in other literature, and are therefore not covered in depth in this chapter, it is important to include their strong presense in the data of study. And to situate them in relation to other chapter contents. HOW EXACTLY. -->



#### MOVE LATER/ JUST A SIGNPOST TO LATER - PARK, FOR NOW?

**It is of value to create spaces to leverage the potential of in-between moments for participants - playtesting or non-productive**

<!--
Note Dropped Faff time.  -->

<!-- SO IS THIS IN RELATION TO CHALLENGING DESIGN STAGE PARAGDIM
I noted in analysis of data that along with frustration there are also moments of creativity, and there are bonding moments which appear to be helped by this activity which is at times quite unfocused but also shared.  -->



The process of swapping graphical assets used a shared Piskel gallery and games area which served to keep individuals informed in directly of progress being made, and to spark curiosity in the creations of others.

In addition, I observed that navigating these essential but non-creative tasks in a collaborative and playful way can reduce learner anxiety and help maintain a positive affect to the overall creative digital process. This observation is supported by an example in the next chapter available in appendix 5.x - an extract of which is included below.


In summary, it is of value to create spaces to leverage the potential of these in-between moments for participants.
ALSO TRUE OF PLAYTESTING

The potential impact on agency is as follows; If these tasks can be seen as more than mere barriers to production, and therefore to be designed out to increase instrumental agency, then there is potential to increase relational agency through flexible divisions of labour that allow the incorp### Implications for practitioners - MOVE LATER?

This approach is flexible and potentially responsive whilst still retaining a unifying pedagogical approach.
