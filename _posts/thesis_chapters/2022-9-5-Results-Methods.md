## Overview in points

- Playing games to start and ongoing play-testing
- Remixing / Half-baked - impact, examples
- Scenarios
- Player and Maker Types
- Finally - Creating a walled garden for GDP - an overview from a cultural, community perspective?

This needs work to structure effectively AND a focus on agency? 


## Culturally Inclusive Methods to Kick Start Game Making Communities

2022-08-11 - now thinking of putting this chapter first. Fits with narrative. And the progression from broader cultural factors, creating a coding culture, and linking to home interests / cultures.

Thus not dealing with the primary unit of activity yet, giving the cultural context. And exploring barriers to participation and efforts to overcome them.

### Overview of contents of chapter

Theme of the chapter - Inclusion and/or Agency.

NOTE - Also when to put data about TOOLS in this chapter or that of the design chapter. As interlinked.
Perhaps data in design chapter when it is based on journal notes and personal / literature based decisions.
And observations in this chapter when can be based up by observable behaviour.

RESPONSES TO DESIGN & INTERVENTIONS

NOTE - THIS IS HARD TO COMPLETE UNTIL THE DESIGN CHAPTER HAS BEEN COMPLETED -
RETURN TO THIS LATER. JUST ADD PLACEHOLDER CONTENT HERE NOW.

Based on Specific Interventions/ Design Choices and responses

<!-- NOTE - PULL FROM ALL SOURCES HERE - JOURNAL, VIDEO, INTERVIEWS -->

### Tools
- Responses to choice of tools & Communities Choice of Coding Tools / Environment / Communities
  - Why not Scratch? Less of a community? So how to replace this? What of time considerations?

- Physical Elements as Tools
  - end boxes used as motivator / engagement
  - extract from interview?

### Creating Community Activity   

- Peer - side by side coding.
  - Parents coding too. See the comments by Mi and her interactions / commentary. And the interaction of Ch-Pa and Te - the quiest support there.

- Game Playing and Playtesting
   - Game playing at start of program - no observations but sets context
   - Play testing - and challenge - a culture of "hardness", curiosity about number of levels, as a vehicle for peer support,

- Drama Process
 - differencing attitudes to games and technology
 - a reflective process to avoid distracting from activity & to share goals and process publically

### Bridging Norms and Values   

- Drawing on Funds of Game cultures
   - player and maker types
   - how to support emerging behaviours and give licence to young people  - side / sub missions
   - the sub missions - divergent activities can be productive
   - knowledge of GDP a fund - but one covered in detail in next chapter.

Organic Responses emerging naturally from community
 - problems solving  - navigating limits of facilitator time
 - Fund of Knowledge that
       - Home cultures and interests guiding subject matter for sub missions and character / scenario choice.

NOTE  - THE DISCUSSION HERE ON FUNDS - NEEDS TO BE CLEAR HOW TO SEPARATE OUT FROM GDPS in the next chapter

####  Notes on Discussion

These are quite disparate so probably makes sense to have a separate discussion entwined in each section rather than one section at the ends.

Relevant theory / studies.

- funds of knowledge
- AT theory for sub missions, in preparation for chapter on main mission / unit of activity

This section uses AT's focus on rules / norms and interactions with other activity systems at home.

## Vignette to start chapter - something Cultural

Choices

- Something about aliens / feedback? Sub- Missions?
- perhaps a feedback session?
- Something about drawing on home interests.
- an example of playtesting?
- an overview of Mi's interactions on 2019-03-18 - home interests of art, community help, playtesting and being playtested, use of tools, Mi as a social coder compared to others.
- Or could look at the whole family unit mi, zi and ne - And their interactions with alien narrative.

<!-- Something like the social activity of Vignette Sh and Th - perhaps even that one - as it goes on to
describe the different kinds of interactions. But that is more interpersonal interactions for the most part.
Here we are looking at something cultural?? -->


## Extract/s from Interview

Something about aliens / feedback? Missions?

## Commentary on Vignette exploring activity from 3 planes of reference.

In this vignette we can pick on the 3 planes analysed in design...
DROP EITHER THIS 3 PLANES / OR THE ONE IN DESIGN?
IS THIS NEEDED?  ONGOING DISCUSSION ON WHEN HOW TO USE THIS.


## Discussions on different interventions

### Game Playing and Playtesting

<!-- NOTE - Include examples here which do not talk of GDP explicitly - but other cultural aspects. -->

For participants, playtesting provided a diversity of community-building behaviour.

Also noticeable is the variety of ways in which playtesting happens and how younger and older participants looked to give and take from the experience.

Older participants often used this as a way of being supportive to both parents and young people. This happened in the following ways:
- praising graphical content
- making links with home interests of participants and building rapport - ( e.g. do you like dogs? )

#### Game playing at start of program - no observations but sets context

Find examples

#### Play testing - and challenge - a culture of "hardness", curiousity about number of levels, as a vehicle for peer support,

Find examples


#### Play testing - and embodied participation in the games of others.

study the body language of those play testing games.
what is there ? - included

- wrestling for control
- movement around the room between screens
- calling across room
- clustering, remaining on outskirts.

### Drama / Fictional Frameworks:

<!-- Background - (be sure to include in lit review)  -->

I use to increase learner engagement in game making is the concept of using a fictional scenario or simulation. A fictional community while less authentic than a professional community, can still provide some of the associated benefits of authenticity. I have worked with practitioners of Drama Education department at Manchester Metropolitan University to develop such fictional dramas, but you do not have to be a trained drama practitioner to draw on key techniques to increase learner engagement. For example, I asked trainee teachers to devise a scenario to support a series of sessions and they used a fiction of making games for an alien race coming to destroy the earth. The process of using a fictional situation can help with the motivation and reflection of learners in the following ways:

- Asking learners to step into a role can increase identification with participation in the project. For example you may say "As game designers, we will make this game for a particular audience".
- Fictional situations can help create a sense of imagined jeopardy which can help learners stay on track with their creative timescale and may increase their commitment to the process.
-  When learners share their games with their real or imagined audience, they can talk through their design decisions and challenges, thus creating an opportunity for reflection.
- Drama processes can help explore identification with or hostility to gaming cultures.


### Physical Computing and Game Making:

- There is scant evidence for this in the video data.
- I can make observations from journal notes and try to find mention of it in interviews.

(Imported Writing)
**Physical Computing and Game Making:** The use of physical computing to create concrete and tangible activities can increase the engagement and motivation of learners [@kaloti-hallak_students_2015]. Making the digital concepts physical, and thus allowing exploration via diverse means, also aligns with inclusive learning principles. To support my game making projects, I created simple arcade cabinets out of wood with retro arcade buttons. Connecting arcade buttons to the computer via simple electronics is a project which can be completed quickly. The process of students building their own arcade cabinets for a games showcase increased their perception of the authenticity of their end goal. Some families created low-tech, customised arcade cabinets using cardboard. Although my studies have been small-scale the self-reported effects on learner engagement and motivation of this part of the program were significant.


<!-- For more information on the value of physical computing to increase inclusion you can read this article (RUSK?) -->

## Tools: Specifics on Code Playgrounds and Phaser and a Javascript framework

Make point that it is hard to separate out tools and communities. In case of Mozilla, code playgrounds, and teach the web, and the culture of developers and teaching communities they are interlinked.

Discuss and compare to Kafai in book, the lineage of Logo, Scratch.
Instead the more authentic approach of a real language.

The limits that this imposed and the development of a new technique of patching as a process, and the use of code frameworks. This you can argue is a much more authentic process which could get extended in other directions.

Bring out detail from the study to this section.

 - the media literacy practices of transfer between tools - similar to other studies - see guided participation papers


### Why Glitch and Code Playgrounds

[THIS IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE SO SHIFT TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER?]

An unusual approach so why?

- involvement with mozilla / teach the web
- authenticity - link between developer community and education, global in scope
- can use a cut and paste, remix, irreverant approach - link to media activist / hacktivist pirate cultures.

other unexpected Benefits

- could bring in other web creation resource, piskel,

Tensions compared to other more walled garden approaches - see below in tensions / move to make code.

### Code Examples and Step By Step Tutorials

Towards the end of phase 1 I began to create code examples to illustrate of how particular commonly requested game features were implemented. These barebone game projects were hosted on a code playground. An online document in our shared google drive working space linked to these examples. I would help participants access this when they requested a certain feature. This list of game features began to grow. For phase one these code example were not particularly successful at increasing learner independence. There were differences in the code structure of their games and the examples and translation was not intuitive.

 In phase 2 I began to write up the implementation of the same game features but more closely integrated with the new starting code template used. Thus these individual tutorials became much directive. The step by step tutorials were available online and also as printed A4 hand outs which were provided on request of the older participants. I have brought the workshops resources together a book published on the FLOSS Manuals documentation platform Chesterman, 2019).

### Guided Code Patching

  In response to on-going frustrations of time blockages, where were commonly reflected back by participants, even after step-by-step tutorials were introduced, I added an additional layer of a more systematic structure to the existing resources. Visual aids guided where to cut and paste code patches within their code structure with a greater level of specificity see figure as an example. This addressed a common lack of detailed understanding of the underlying code structure used in the code and the importance to place code extracts in the correct function to maintain the integrity of the syntax.

  In making decisions like the one to include extra visual scaffolding in step by step documentations. I am balancing here many different factors of concern in the complex learning environment. These include; authenticity of programming environment and language, use of the existing structure of the phaser library, the learning process of participants getting stuck and having to resolve tensions, my time limits providing individual support as a facilitator of a group, and the patience of participants when they encounter incomplete documentation.

  During this process of careful documentation I became concerned that over facilitation in this instructional way would remove the possibility for errors and thus reduce the opportunities for learning from resolving failure. However, while each stage of the process of adding game pattern was documented in as complete a fashion as possible, in practice mistakes were still made and additional customisations were made. Thus while the process did reduce dependency on my input as a facilitator there were still opportunities for me to support and resolve coding errors in person. When doing this I or other volunteers were able at times to give wider perspectives on the details of specific coding concepts and wider computational patterns. For example in terms of process, rather than writing code from first principles, this 'code patching' technique and subsequent debugging more closely represents the kinds of skills used by computer professionals on an everyday basis



### On Debugging and Embracing Different Types of Errors

 In the context surrounding the interaction outlined in the above vignette, the parent had tried valiantly to overcome a conflict caused by incomplete documentation and her own incomplete knowledge of the computational patterns used in the construction of the game's code. A way to start to normalise the experience of overcoming blocks is to get greater granularity on into the detail and types or errors. In the art of war on errors, we must know our enemy. These include:

 -   **Syntax and Program Errors** are errors in your code which stop the game from functioning at all, often resulting in a blank screen.
 -   **No Behaviour Bugs** are errors which in your code which don't stop the game from functioning but your intended effect is not present when it should be.
 -   **Glitches** don't stop your game from running but as you play you see that there is an unintended effect. The game does something different from what we want it to do.


#### Syntax and Program errors vs No Behaviour

Find examples.

Sh & Th for example gets so frustrated that keeps moving on to create compound errors.
One no behaviour bug can be worked around but a syntax bug stops everything.


#### Glitch Examples

Short examples of different types and the affect implications.

Glitch errors can be productive.

**Productive in exploring code / creating new game opportunites**
An interesting one where the x / y axis mix up for Te 2019-03-18 leads to a new challenge in the game.

**Productive in in **

- Glitch - 2019-05-08 - Te and Da  - create moving enemy but it totally leaves the screen. This caused amusement and participants knew how they thought they would follow that up.

 The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful.

#### Discussion on Errors

Further analysis of the different kinds of errors that are likely to arrive and testing different strategies for dealing with them that take into account the zone or proximal development of the participants may provide not only useful input for the participants, but also opportunities to check understandings of processes and game patterns and computational patterns in use.

Question - do more useful / less de-motivating errors result from remixing and game patching?

Perhaps see the above glitch examples. Not fully understanding every line of code can create a fun, unpredictable environment. We can infer from these examples that wrong behaviour may be easier to investigate and to correct than no-behaviour errors.

Aspects of the design encourage this kinds of error. Certainly the process of code patching does.

## Community Aspects of the 3M design

When reviewing video data. There are lots of interactions, peer and pair, that are influenced by the community focus of the learning design.

A bullet point summary follows

- helpers circulating (2019-03-18-te for example )-  playtesting as a community activity and feedback.
- getting help from all sources possible

### Circulation of peers and helpers & playtesting

This often facilitates talk aloud of design decisions and justifications.

### Accessing Help and Documentation

In the emerging community there was a variety of help available including;

- Written documentation from the learning design via step by step tutorials
- A series of code examples in working code playgrounds
- Facilitator help through asking for help
- Student Helper attention and help
- Peer support from parents and children

#### Tactical use of in-session support time

Parent Ma made a comment showing that he was aware of the particular value of the in-class sessions to overcome some kinds of blockages.

#### Accessing online, professional/community documentation

Te and Da - Accessing documentation Phaser

The process of modelling the specific practices of accessing developer documents and help forums is a form of apprenticeship and a direct sharing of a professional cultural practice.

Te takes a lead on looking for help on added a new GDP following enemies. He starts with menu, then book, then Da suggests googling and thus taking a step outside of the walled garden.

Discussion. There are pros and cons stepping outside that garden. Confusion, conflicts, complexity. etc. Vs. generating new patterns and personalisation of game content.
NOTE - THIS LINKS WITH DISCUSSION ON CHOICE OF DESIGN MORE GENERALLY.


#### Tactics in accessing help from peers and facilitators

A common teacher tactic is ask three then me.

The family group of Mi, Zi and Ne showed a lot of flexibility and tactical choices when trying to overcome blocks.

Zi more directly and loudly asking for help for faciliator often followed by comment from his mother to leave him alone.

in 2019-03-18 - 18.20 Mi's meets many small blocks and asks for help from a variety of people.
- Student helper to get online,
- Peer parent about use of piskel, and then her son
- Ne daughter
- Mick overall facilitator


#### Division of Labour - code patching and experimentation

While the parents are the ones doing the majority of the heavily lifting importing new code, children are observering and emulating this behaviour.

The documentation leads to a page with code examples.
In one interaction child Ne visits the page to add a mechanic, starts to scan it, highlights some code, but then seems to change her mind - perhaps recognising limits - or fearing the process of breaking her game - and returns to more familiar territory of changing game assets and level design.
