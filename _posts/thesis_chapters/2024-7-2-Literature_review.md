# Literature Review

### Research Questions - July 2024

1. What contradictions arose in participation in this research's game coding processes and what pedagogical tools and processes are available to address these contradictions?
2. How can game design patterns support the development of computational fluency in novices?
3. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?

<!-- NOTE - Does this need to be explicitly via Sociocultural take -->

To help answer the research questions and to prepare the reader for the findings of this thesis, this literature review explores pedagogies and resources used by practitioners and learners to support the process of learning. The LR is themed broadly using Rogoff's three planes of analysis (personal knowledge, interpersonal activity and cultural factors) [@rogoff_observing_1995. This approach appears to have influenced the structure of Kafai and Burke's review of this area [@kafai_connected_2014-1; @kafai_constructionist_2015-1]. While Kafai and Burke's work as a convincing review of some of the diverse potential and efficacy  of game coding, this LR focuses in on the detail of the pedagogies of relevant studies.

However, as studies do not neatly fall in to each category they are not structured rigidly via section. Instead this chapter follows a general direction studies which outline pedagogies focusing on personal knowledge to those which draw on social coding practices and finally covers studies with a significant element of development of cultural practices of coding. While most pedagogies explored here are specific to approaches for game making or learning coding at times where needed to capture community focuses the net is cast  wider to highlight more general principles.




**LR and how it addresses RQs**

This chapter helps answer the research questions in the following ways. In coverage of relevant studies I focus in particular the to barriers to participation and pedagogical elements which address them as notes in RQ1.

A section in the middle of the chapter addresses game design patterns in particular, as the focus of RQ2, and exposes gaps in the current research in the area of developing notice coding practices.

RQ3 addresses the development of agency, a deeper exploration of which is covered Chapter 3. In this literature review of pedagogies, it is worth noting the following elements in pedagogies which are relevant to later discussion.

- the limits of contextual settings on the development of agency
- pedagogical frameworks which help participants develop coding practices within a community focus
- pedagogies which facilitate and highlight community membership: e.g. Barron's roles and legitimate peripheral participation

**Specifics of structure**

The chapter begins with pedagogies focused on personal knowedge within a K12 school education context

This starts with a examination of computational thinking as a pedagogy.

It also address some key barriers to coding practices presented by the constraints of curriculum and assessment.

### Examples of research on practice

#### Ito / Gee - hanging out
#### Home making and consuming of media


Messing around and affinity groups. Ito's work on  and naturalistic studies of digital use and creativity in the home including the value of informal playing around [@ito_connected_2013-1; @ito_hanging_2010], and Gee and the process of tapping into affinity groups and affinity spaces [@gee_what_2004].  Gee's (2004b) work on games and associated culture as learning experiences is founded on his understanding of how the engender a shared discourse and emerging identities .

In addition, maker culture more generally is relevant due to the alignment with tinkering as educational practice in stem education, supported by family involvement and brokering of experiences. The details of tinkering as a pedagogical practice are explored in more detail in the literature review of this thesis.


Casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014].


Building on the concept of participatory culture [@jenkins_confronting_2009], where x and y, there are several streams of activity that are important to reference as foundational context for this study.




<!-- Barron and Livingstone have outlined the advantages and processes involved in family involvement of technology use and learning in the home. -->

<!-- There is clearly an inequality of access to these well paid profession that the development of the computing curriculum and the skills based and creative process focus that was part of the initial narrative is laudable the aims of equality. -->

<!-- However the practical and and cultural difficulties of undertaking a project-based approach within the curriculum are significant. Factors of difficulties associated with technology projects compound difficulties. -->





#### Mozilla, authentic-link toolsets

A Mozilla white paper [@mozilla_foundation_webmaker_2014] outlines the power of exploring web technology as an empowering activity. As part of their teach the web and web literacy programme, Mozilla created internet browser based tools to support of novices investigate and to remix HTML pages. They also created several online and real-life communities sharing activities drawing on home interests to explore authentic web technologies, and the digital literacy elements needed to be an effective citizen. [@thorne_clubs_2015].

In 2015 I contributed a short line course called Quacking Javascript to this webmaker curriclum. In my report on the underlying pedagogical approaches [@chesterman_webmaking_2015],  I outlines the following possibilities to increase participant engagement; playful approaches, use of games, and the ability for particpiants to incorporate popular culture and home interests into their work.

<!-- My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics and Scratch. -->

### Inequality of access to participatory culture communities (Barrier)

In these more naturalistic settings, Ito and colleagues note that generative activities are the exception rather than norm even in expressly creative communities [-@ito_hanging_2010]. Productive partnerships in communities like Scratch are extremely rare compared to false starts. Studies of the New Grounds site which has a similar aim of creating media collaborations, via collabs, showed a 80 percent failure rate of collaborative projects [@luther_why_2010].

On the other end of the spectrum is the desire to bring open-ended practices into the school setting. We see that a similar pattern in different communities -- ABOVE IN MAKING - SCRATCH IN SCHOOLS While the focus of my study will be on family learning, due to the need for strategies to bring game making into schools settings, which I will address this issue. Kafai's study detailing an emergent peer pedagogy, accepts some of the limits of the school setting but identifies peer practices that show great promise.


## Pedagogies for project-based game making via coding


### What is a pedagogy?

One of the main themes of this review is to address what pedagogies are available in to help coding, in relation to RQ1.

Following activity theory terms pedagogy can be reframed as pedagogical tools and processes and can be viewed as a kind of mediational strategy.

## Computation Thinking: curriculum concepts and/or and pedagogical framework

### Situating Computational thinking within curricular concerns


The promotion of Computational Thinking (CT) has been a key factor in the development of the UK's computing curriculum. However, the claims of early advocates that CT skills could be applied widely in subjects beyond computing are now advanced more cautiously to avoid the danger of over-promising [@tedre_long_2016]. We can use the distinction between concrete and abstract to examine the differences between two popular interpretations of Computational Thinking (CT). The first is an influential take from Jeanette Wing. "The most important and high-level thought process in computational thinking is the abstraction process. Abstraction is used in defining patterns, generalizing from instan#ces, and parameterization" [@wing2011research]. Many learning resources designed to support the computing curriculum present this principle as four key pillars of CT: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithmic thinking [@bbc_bitesize_introduction_nodate]. The essence here is to deal with concepts and principles as abstract and separate from the context of coding.

Another widely used definition of CT by Brennan and Resnick [-@brennan_new_2012] was developed in response to a thought experiment "How do we describe what Tim, Shannon, and Renita are learning as they participate as designers of interactive media with Scratch?". The researchers took a grounded / situated approach to mapping the potential learning dimensions of students designing and coding collaborative, creative computing projects. The resulting map they created includes computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives.

- _Computational concepts_ include sequences,
loops, parallelism, events, conditionaluma; thus representing the mechanics of coding structures.
- _Computational practices_ include debugging, iteration, reuse and remixing, and abstracting and taking a modular approach.
- _Computational perspectives_ such as expressing, questioning connecting were observed in the behaviour of learners completing their coding designs.

This interpretation of CT, based on observation of learners in action, is more accessible to teachers and learners as they can more easily recognise their own practice than in the more abstract interpretations of CT. To give a specific example, rather than decomposition, the applied framework outlines taking an iterative, incremental approach to problem solving and arranging code in modules.

This broader, process driven definition of CT has been used and adapted by many organisations seeking to support the new computing curiculum may be familiar from websites, posters and other supporting material created by groups like Barefoot computing. Lye's extensive review of teaching Computational Thinking [@lye_review_2014] used Resnick and Brennan's definition as the basis for the review, which points to the widespread use of this more applied approach. The wider definition of CT here assumes an environment where learners are engaged in the collaborative coding of a computing project. The review above and the influential framework used by Computing at School [@csizmadia_computational_2015-1]  have included elements of this applied framework as well as other more abstract CT concepts.


### Studies exploring CT as an pedagogical framework to support learning computer coding

The term abstraction has varied interpretation even within the field of computer science education [@hazzan_reducing_2002]. Papert and Turkle's [-@papert_epistemological_1990] encourage a of diversity in approaches to teaching coding beyond a formal, abstract approach "that emphasizes control and through structure and planning". Their celebration of concrete coding approaches, including the use of tangible physical and digital objects, and more piecemeal, bricolage approach has influenced the design of popular educational programming software and pedagogy through the constructionist school and maker movements (as explored in the literature review). In a challenge to this article Wilensky [-@wilensky1991abstract] questions the nature of abstract in this context arguing that all objects and concepts are abstract until familiarity makes them more concrete to the user.

Tedre and Denning's [-@tedre_long_2016] review of CT cautions against a too narrow definition of CT that highlights formal abstractions as represented by Wing's take on CT [-@wing_computational_2008]. This is not to argue that Wing's approach to CT is without technical merit [@lodi_computational_2021], rather that its adoption by educational bodies like CAS in the UK and similar bodies internationally has risks. The inclusion of formal CT frameworks in curriculum and formal testing has provoked mechanistic teaching of decontextualised concepts via formal teaching methods to the detriment of hands-on exploration and creation of personally meaningful projects [@resnick_coding_2020].

In teaching computing pedagogy the concept of levels of abstraction can be taught to students to help them understand the level of abstraction that they are working at [@statter_teaching_2016; @waite_abstraction_2016; @waite_abstraction_2018-1]. To quickly review LOA, the levels are Problem, Design, Code, Running the Code. And the purpose is, "Levels of abstraction has been interpreted as a hierarchy to enable teachers and learners to describe which level they are working at, rather than as a methodology for programming projects."[@waite_abstraction_2018]

## PRIMM, Semantic Waves and pushing the abstract

### PRIMM

FIND MATERIAL IN OTHER BOOK CHAPTERS

PRIMM addresses the perceived need for  structured and explicit approach to teaching computing concepts and is particularly aimed at a school setting [@sentance_teaching_2019].


**PRIMM:** PRIMM stands for Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify and Make. This model helps learners adopt coding practices and computational concepts through providing a concrete code example that they run after predicting what it does. Learners make changes to the existing code before finally creating code from scratch. PRIMM's starting point is students predicting existing code results. Asking students to identify target computing concepts in code examples allows teachers to guide students towards key computational thinking process or algorithmic details. Thus, PRIMM is well suited to the classroom as starting with prediction of a code allows a whole class of learners to unpack and repack the same set of concepts in a restricted time scale. This process that supports formal problem solving, paper-based questions of the GCSE exams. The use of code examples and a structured set of varied activities aligns well to UDL principle of representing knowledge in a variety of means. For a more detailed summary of the PRIMM approach the Quick Read pedagogy article.[^5]


Primm based on UMC but developed to highlight abstract concepts and processes via a predict stage.

In proposing PRIMM Sentence et al  highlights a deficit of exploration based approaches of Papert and constructionism proposed by Grover
[-@sentance_teaching_2019, p. 5]

However, given the importance of explicit instruction of concepts, it seems lacking then that there is no guidance on what  concepts should be best explored via this pedagogy.

A similar observation can be made of a linked pedagogy that of semantic waves which uses an example of algorithms in one research process but again does not link to an underlying framework of "complex" concepts to illustrate.

We can turn to the UK curriculum perhaps for guidance.

THIS COUDL BE PUT BEFORE CT - AND THEN CT IS EXPLPORED AS A FRAMEWORK OF CONCEPTS - THEN A PEDAGOGY

DEVELOP THIS DEFICIT AND THE ASSUMPTIONS PRESENT IN A CRITICAL WAY ABSTRACT VS CONCRETE

### Semantic Profiles and Waves

CT instruction can be aided with a focus of teachers on semantic profiles and waves.

Semantic profiles chart the use of more concrete (high semantic gravity) language and more abstract (high semantic density) concepts and patterns as they emerge in classroom situations [@macnaught_jointly_2013]. Exploring semantic profiles is being promoted by NCCE  an aid to teachers wanting to plan their lessons in a way that communicates the key abstract curriculum knowledge that students will need for exams, and to also allow them to put the concepts into practice to build real coding skills and to make valuable connections to personal experience. A Quick Read on semantic profiles is available on the NCCE website.[^2]

Research carried out by Curzon and colleagues [-@curzon_using_2020] in a computing education context outlines the value of semantic profiles in wave shape as opposed to a flatline which remains too much in concrete examples or more abstract concepts. This research highlights the value of unpacking, exploring and then repacking ideas during the course of a lesson. A student's understanding of a concept may deepen a little bit each time it is applied in practice and then reconnected with the abstract.

<!-- start with activities that allow the use of more concrete (high semantic gravity) language and then explore more abstract (high semantic density) concepts and patterns as they emerge in these authentic situations. -->

![semantic waves]({{ site.baseurl }}/Pictures/semantic_waves.png)


Figure 3.1 A Semantic Profile with Semantic Waves

Examples showing semantic wave profiles usually start with the process beginning with the abstract or with high semantic density. See Figure 1.1 for an example. The advice of starting with more abstract terminology and concepts may seem to be in opposition to the approach of Concreteness Fading as explained with the CRA method outlined above. However, on examination of the research example carried out in the research above, the process of starting with concepts may only involve giving a short outline of the concept that is being explored and saying that this will be illustrated in a following concrete activity.

### Problematising distinctions between instruction-based tutorials and unguided approaches

The process of learning technical skills through trial and error is something that many self-driven learners are familiar with. The desire to complete a particular project and self-motivated access to the resources to achieve it is the stuff of computing mythology, recalling the kind of garage innovation that created Apple computer and early hacker computing culture [@fuller_garage_2015]. However, this is not an ideal pedagogy. Even with access to resources and critiques of pure discovery learning are also valid [@mayer_should_2004].

On the other end of the spectrum, tutorials are a common way of learning coding and exist in many forms and formats [@head_composing_2020; @kim_pedagogical_2017].

Code snippets are often interwoven with text explaining the function of the code constructions.

The variety of audience and motivations of writer can account for the variation in form. Researcher also point out the limits of online coding tutorials namely that: "few explain when and why a particular concept is useful in programming; and few provide guidance for common errors" [@kim_pedagogical_2017, p. 325].

Critique of instruction...

In short there are concerns with reproduction of information as a goal for varied reason but authenticity of experience and resulting negative on effects on motivation and participant agency are of particular relevance to this study.

### Use Modify Create

The 'Use-Modify-Create' approach proposed by Lee and colleagues [-@lee_computational_2011] is particularly promising to counter issue of user anxiety and demotivation surrounding the difficulty of coding games. UMC evolved from research involving the use of game making and robotics to support computational thinking [@denner_computer_2012; @denner_using_2014; @werner_pair_2013; @werner_children_2014]. The model advocates the remixing of existing games to act as a scaffold to build the competence of the beginner coder. Learners are guided to progress in the complexity of their modifications, thus becoming increasing proficient in the recognition and use of computational concepts and structures [-@lee_computational_2011]

**Use:** In the _Use_ stage, coders build a familiarity with coding interfaces, code structures and syntax through scaffolded approaches which involve interacting with the program code and what it produces.

**Modify:** In the _Modify_ stage learners progress to working on real projects created by others. Learners deepen their knowledge of coding structures and practices by altering existing projects and templates to suit their own aims.

**Create:** After novice coders become more familiar with patterns of code design in use in the modify stage, they can progress to replicate such patterns in other code that they create from scratch.

A study involving five hundred 9 to 14 year-olds found that the UMC approach can balance a structured approach with more student-led exploration [@franklin_analysis_2020]. The researchers also found that the students enjoyed the UMC approach as they had more choice and agency in the process. This is supported by other research which compared UMC with a starting-from-scratch approach and found higher student engagement for those in the UMC group [@lytle_use_2019]. The researchers found that because students using UMC had more time to play around with code, they were able to add their own personal touches and that this ownership over the code sustained their continued engagement. While the scope of the study is limited, observations support motivation of UMC that this pattern of creation maintains higher level of engagement through reducing technical barriers to participation, and affording greater sense of learner's ownership over end project through greater choice over the final outcome.

**Research on UMC which develops learner choice**

<!-- NOTE - This may be moved to design chapter -->

UMC has been developed to be end with scaffolded set of choices.
In a study where students use a block based language to develop simulations - the authors note limits of study but are enthusiastic about providing a limited set of choices for final exploration within a limited time frame [@lytle_use_2019-1; @lytle_use_2019]

- Scaffold Students and Teachers- Providing the necessary programming blocks students need to complete a choice
- Differentiate Choices by Difficulty - create choice systems that have varying difficulty
- Create Choices that Show Visible and Immediate Changes
- Make things Complex, not Complicated
- Draw from Student Desires - students will engage more with the material, feeling like the creations are their own.




<!--
  - Scaffold Students and Teachers- Providing the necessary pro-gramming blocks students need to complete a choice ala a Par-son’s Problem greatly reduces cognitive load, especially in activitieswhere lots of choices means lots of blocks. Similarly, giving teachers a “Cheat Sheet" of answers for each choice, scaffolds their abilityto act as a facilitator and debugger.

  Differentiate Choices by Difficulty- This time, challenge came from adding morec hoices, but each choice was relatively the samedifficulty. In the future, we wish to create choice systems that havevarying difficulty to give targeted tasks for each student skill level.

- Create Choices that Show Visible Change
  - Prioritize choicesthat produce immediate changes in the run of the simulation (e.g. anew animal appearing in the environment).Create Choices that Promote Content Inquiry- Our decisionto primarily focus on adding more animals came from the fact thateach new animal made the Food Web more complex.

  - Make things Complex, not Complicated- As demonstrated in Figure 2, each animal had relatively the same set of code blocks. In this way, a lot of choices were available without adding many additional necessary blocks for students.

- Draw from Student Desires- Some of the choice ideas (e.g. bear)came from responses from students in the ‘Fox-Only’ -->



### Microworlds as an embodiment of UMC and other constructionist design principles
<!-- (generated by chat gpt) -->

LOGO and Scratch have had a huge influence as have the constructionist design principles

The main concept of UMC is remixing a game to build . Scratch has been instrumental in bringing this methodology into clubs and classrooms as an explicit feature of its online community.


Constructionist design principles emerge in tandem with the frequent revision of the tools in question in response to the direction and interest of the community. This form of praxis is illustrated in a good level of detail in Papert's extensive pedagogical writings and the community of researchers and educators clustered around development of scratch and associated pedagogies.



### Constructionist design principles

The development of Logo as a programming language moved towards the use of block coding under the stewardship of MIT labs.

Resnick's work on constructionist design principles via software and tinkering tools merits summary here. CF - introduction.


Papert's concept of microworlds refers to simplified computer simulations or models that provide a controlled environment in which students can explore and experiment with maths or physics concepts in a concrete  way [@harel_constructionism:_1991; @papert_mindstorms:_1980; @papert_childrens_1993].

Papert believed that microworlds were an effective tool for promoting computational thinking. His take on CT however, should be contrasted to a abstracted later take from Wing [@lodi_computational_2021]. Instead here CT concepts are heuristics developed from concrete experience.  
This concept of CT as a set of heuristics or design behaviours continues in practitioner-focused interpretations of CT.

MOVE TO LR
There is  research on computing projects in the work of Papert [-@papert_mindstorms_1980] on Mircoworlds and subsequent research on programming tools in the constructionist tradition  [@kafai_constructionism_1996-1; @kafai_mindstorms_2014].


Papert argued that microworlds could help students develop computational thinking skills by providing them with opportunities to experiment with computational processes and to reflect on their own thinking. In addition to the software based tool of the microworld, the social context is key to the whole process.

While, examples of a Microworlds are diverse [@rieber_microworlds_2004], a Turtle drawing world using  LOGO can be used here as an example. In the Mathland of the turtle which speaks only LOGO, children are drawn to speak LOGO to progress. The affordances of the physical turtle provide visible motivation.


He argued that by working with microworlds, students could engage in hands-on and minds-on learning, which would help them to develop a deeper and more meaningful understanding of the concepts they were studying.

The work of Papert and the concept of microworlds continue to be influential in the field of educational technology [@kafai_constructionism_1996-1].

Today, microworlds are used in a variety of educational settings, from primary schools, afterschool clubs and universities. However, the use of microworlds in traditional school settings is not unproblematic [@papert_turtles_2002]. There is a danger that the potential is 'trivialised'[@hoyles_microworldsschoolworlds_1993] into a vehicle for instruction based processes aimed narrowed to teacher chosen curricular concepts.  


### Half-baked games as Microworlds

The concept of 'half-baked' games, which are incomplete or somehow deficient in a way which motivates learners to delve into the code and improve them offers a possible enchancement to the 'Use-Modify-Create' model []

This concept of builds on Papert's concept of micro world used a framework for making and coding.

The focus of half-baked games is to design them in a way which encourages malleability of the code in directions that the learner may find interesting [@kynigos_half-baked_2007; @kynigos_children_2018]. Thus the original game designer makes complex decisions which highlight certain affordances of the game in a way which encourages the exploration of key concepts, in this case computational thinking.

Kynigos and Yiannoutsou identify a progression in the type of CT skills being used as the processing of modifying the game progresses as part of the Use-Modify-Create model moving from elements like pattern recognition associated with reading of code to ones like a creating abstracted structures and sequencing their own algorithms. Kynigos also highlights the possibilities of half-baked artefacts to build learner dialogue around the problems at hand as as 'a communicational tool to shape a common language within the community' 2007, p. 336).



### Pair programming & social/collaborative coding

**Pair Programming:**  Pair Programming groups students in pairs and divide coding two into two roles. One student undertakes hands-on coding while the other is free to think about more the abstract design of the overall program. A benefit of pair programming is to increase coding confidence as students build their experience of the different roles involved in coding. To help novice coders teachers should model and break down the processes involved. Pair programming involves social learning elements and can model a greater choices for students in they way they solve problems. The process of building an identity in a community with the help of peers is key to a socio-cultural understanding of how learners pick up coding in a classroom (or other settings). The importance of a coding community is explored in another chapter in this collection on design and project approaches. A summary of pair programming roles and tips on how teachers can help learners to adopt them in present in a Quick Read document from NCCE.[^6]

###  Project Based Learning (PBL)

The educational strategy of learning how to code games lends itself to a project based learning (PBL) approach. The following section explores common elements of PBL and summarises links with game making approaches and the legacy of game making studies.

In broad terms, PBL is an educational strategy which x,y and z

For game making the following aspects are particularly relevant: authenticity of audience, student choice and voice, etc


Project-approaches are widely advocated by Papert via constructionism school and taken up by MIT researchers and programmes, especially the outreach work of Mitchell Resnick surrounding Scratch and other creative computing project.

PBL also aligns with a much broader progressive approach to education. The broad benefits can be summarised as such;

- Student choice

**Cautionary note**
While the above claims are widely supported, the wide nature of the definition complicates any broad claims of replicability.

It is also of value to explore PBL as an inclusive pedagogy - WHY?



#### Project Based Learning as an inclusive pedagogy

The term inclusion in education no longer addresses solely children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) but also examines barriers of race, culture and other exclusionary elements of the school environment and discourse [@black-hawkins_achievement_2008]. The issue of alienation from the culture of computing in schools has been identified as an issue of concern especially for girls and some ethnic minorities [@the_royal_society_after_2017].  Recent studies study the use of games and playful techniques to overcome exclusion from the culture of computing [@kafai_diversifying_2017; @kafai_beyond_2014]. If students feel excluded from school culture then making bridges to home cultures is vital.

One way to make those connections to home cultures is to allow for more choice of what can be incorporated into computing projects. The benefits of game making as a form of project-based learning (PBL) also align with a teaching framework focused on inclusion called Universal Design for Learning (UDL)[@basham_understanding_2013]. While an analysis of the synergies between PBL and UDL is beyond the remit of this chapter, key characteristics of game making as an educational activity align well with both UDL and project-based approaches. The following sections give three examples.


#### Complications with Project Based Learning

PBL should reconcile some of the tension and challenges outlined above in learning coding in formal settings.

Resnick, advocate for Scratch software, in particular is vocal in promotion of PBL approaches in his projects, play and passion - lifelong kindergarten pedagogy.

However there are addition al challenges of delivering PBL

Lack of frameworks, expertise, confidence etc.

These challenges are often compounded by contextual factors of formal education which challenge creative approaches in general. These include challeges of exam pressure, time factors.

Specific techniques of PBL and digital making are explored in more depth in chapter two and example of practice are also present in the following case studies.




<!-- The next section deals with inclusive
Web-based or software activities include game making, meme creation, hobby website creation or making storytelling adventures. Incorporating materials from narrative forms like books, films, games and social media content into computing projects increases the ability for learners to bring their own interests into the mix. However, while the range of materials and possible creative projects is exciting and full for promise for computing teachers, it is not always clear how to best approach these opportunities from an educational point of view. This chapter will explore teaching and learning approaches to increase learner engagement with computing, firstly by defining and exploring concrete approaches, and then by sharing useful classroom tactics.
 pedagogy but Florian and BH make a distinction with other similar terms does this need to be explored?  -->

<!-- Researchers Black-Hawkins and Florian [-@black-hawkins_classroom_2012] note that many teachers report lacking the knowledge to effectively teach children with SEND issues.  -->







#### Game making and Project / Problem Based Learning

Game making can be seen as an example of the kind of wicked problem favoured in project-oriented problem based learning (referred to from now on as PBL) (Mateas and Stern, 2005). PBL has a variety of forms, an exploration of which is beyond the scope of this study (Aditomo et al., 2013). The most pertinent areas of PBL of to this study are the over-arching focus on authentic learning environments and the process of building learner autonomy within a structured and supportive approach [@hernandez_aalborg_2015]

When learners undertake real life projects with relevance for, or with a direct link to, environments outside of the learning space, there are strong parallels to the models of peripheral participation in communities of practice (Wenger, 1998).  A PBL game making process would do well to foster participation by highlighting playful paths into community participation to maximise group identification and sustainability (Thorsted et al., 2015). Fictional tasks and roles can also impact learner engagement (Heathcote and Herbert, 1985).

The structuring of the learning involved in PBL is highlighted by those wishing to defend it from dismissal as unsupported, pure discovery learning (Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007; Kirschner et al., 2006). We can see parallels in PBL programme design to that tinkering tools and environments in that decisions are made to support specific areas of learner discovery deemed of particular value by carefully obscuring other potentially distracting aspects behind ‘black box’ processes (Resnick and Silverman, 2005).
OTHER HEURISTICS OF CONSTRUCTIONISM

I propose that there guidance and tactics in area of discovery based learning to help balance between learner choice and engaging, open experimentation verses steering towards useful shared concepts is often under explored in research leaving a documentation gap that .   

Why does this gap exist? Partly due to the compressed form of academic papers, partly due to the privileging of abstract analysis over more domain specific observations on practice.


#### PBL and Authenticity in the domain of teaching programming

The goal of authenticity of expression, assessment and the motivation of a real audience aligns PBL with the kind of learning that happens when people take part in work-place or other authentic activities.

There are overlapping dimensions and spectrum of authenticity in learning environments including; hands-on experimentation (as opposed to text-book sources); proximity to workplace practices and professional tools; personal relevance to learners.

While PBL has the potential to address all of these factors there is some ambiguity in much of the literature on PBL. EXAPAND WITH CRITICALITY. There is a lack of clear advice on how to ensure authenticity

In the domain of computer programming,

The next section deals with pedagogical approaches that are rooted in professional or non-educational settings.  

#### Issues of Inclusion and PBL addressed through UDL principles

One way to address SEND issues is to use differentiation to adapt a the standard lesson plan for learners needing special support. However this view of a standard, optimal learner pathway is not supported by recent research in neurodiversity, which suggests there is no one optimal way for students to learn. Inclusive pedagogies take a different approach to differentiation which places more power in the hands of learners to choose the path that is most appropriate for them. All students are given a greater choice of materials and activities from the start suiting the varied needs of all students. This has the benefit of removing stigmatisation of some learners having to undertake work that seen to be created for _low-achieving_ students. These principles - among others - are presented in a framework called Universal Design for Learning (UDL).


Rather than designing separate activities and support for learners with different educational needs in the classroom - often labelled accommodations for disability - UDL facilitates learners to choose a learning pathway that suits their individual abilities and learning strategies.

UDL places great value on the personal relevance, choice and authenticity of learning experiences. As a way to encourage engagement UDL suggests setting choices of concrete learning goals that are relevant to the learners. This learner-led approach is very different to a traditional-instruction based, directive approach to teaching. The diverse learning pathways offered can be unfamiliar for both teachers and for students. The UDL guidelines recognise this and provide information to support teachers to implement them. As educators, we may need to build our own abilities and familiarity with learner-led approaches as well as growing the autonomy of our students.  

<!-- Students can then be supported in the discovery and recording of the underlying concepts after undertaking activities. -->
<!-- ### Case Study - Exploring Universal Design for Learning in Context -->
One area of UDL that teachers can implement straightforwardly is to represent concepts in the classroom in a diversity of ways. In a related study, researchers Cook and colleagues [@cook_using_2016] explored the alignment of UDL with another framework, CRA, which consists of a three stage model to support learners to develop concepts [@fyfe_concreteness_2014].


The researchers outline how the three stages of CRA (Concrete, Representational and Abstract) align with key UDL principles, most specifically multiple ways to represent knowledge to aid learner perception and comprehension. In short, first teachers introduce a physical, concrete model of the concept, then progress to iconic forms, for example graphics or pictures; finally learners work with more abstract models of the concept. The CRA framework is an example of concept popular in Mathematics research and practice called Concreteness Fading where concepts are introduced in concrete examples and then learners are supported to understand and represent them in more abstract ways.

When reading about different approaches to teaching computing the terms concrete and abstract are used commonly. For example the concrete practice of coding is a good way for learners to work with more abstract computing concepts. The following section explores the utility of these terms to explore inclusive approaches to teaching especially in relation to an understanding of Computational Thinking.

## Pedagogical resources in the form of professional practices and frameworks

These professional practices and framework are both informed by research and in common use in professional communities.

Where there is overlap between domains this is explored in each section.

### Design steps frameworks via stages

Many design frameworks exist in diverse areas of production with varied degrees of adoption. One stream in CS stems from engineering and design thinking [@mouza_imagining_2013; @resnick_all_2007; @winarno_steps_2020-1].

A typical framework from teach engineering website [@noauthor_engineering_nodate], takes the form of
Ask: Identify the Need & Constraints;
Research the Problem;
Imagine: Develop Possible Solutions;
Plan: Select a Promising Solution;
Create: Build a Prototype;
Test and Evaluate Prototype; and Improve: Redesign as Needed

This has been adapted by computing educators elements of are included in early literature to help adoption of new computing curriculum in UK [@csizmadia_computational_2015].

Michel Resnick, a researcher involved in the Scratch project at MIT illustrates an approach to design-based education through a creative cycle. The five circular stages are; Imagine, Create, Play, Share, Reflect and returning to Imagine once more. The model encourages both parents and teachers to create a supportive environment for creativity.

![creative spiral image]({{ site.baseurl }}/Pictures/Figure8.1.jpg)


Figure 8.1. Diagram of five circular stages; Imagine - Create - Play - Share - Reflect - Imagine  


There is less clarity about if and how the stages could be used by learners to scaffold their design process.   
(critique of this in terms of writing structures stages at primary )


#### Broad design based approaches

Resnick [-@resnick_scratched_2012] describes the foundations of the design-based approaches in education as; engaging in design activities, exploring personally meaningful topics, collaborating with others, and deepening understanding through reflection. The key reason to adopt these principles is to increase engagement via sustained participation in computing projects for a broad range of learners. One of the sources for sustained engagement is when, as part of the iterative process, learners are able to test and then revise their creation or experiment based on their own evaluation. Another factor is the importance of a community in the design process, as a real audience for creations, as a source of inspiration and as peer evaluators in the testing process.



### MDA and conceptual game elements framework

The MDA framework has been created from games research with an aim to help define

The Mechanics element of the framework has much in common with GDPs. The different is explored by researchers [@olsson2014conceptual].

The common element is the utility of the concepts to designers. Although the process of formalising such patterns and mechanics is also noted.
The levels of abstraction of



### Design Patterns and Game Design Patterns in professional context

NOTE - I think there is material to copy and paste here.

Design patterns are most commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing but they are also useful for all levels of learners. Design patterns are rooted in real-life incidences of problems that are often solved in a particular way. They are concrete examples of coding principles in context.

Design patterns are most commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing but they are also useful for all levels of learners. Design patterns are rooted in real-life incidences of problems that are often solved in a particular way. They are concrete examples of coding principles in context. Design patterns can help the development of coding communities if more experiences coders take the time to document the patterns they use in an accessible way for novice coders. For educators the use of design patterns can help support learners develop coding proficiency by providing scaffolding and modelling good design decisions. However, one of the challenges for teachers of using worked examples and design patterns is how to integrate them into student-led design challenges.



<!-- This mirrors work done to automatically analyse Scratch project to assess levels of Computational Thinking Hoover et al., 2016). Here by contrast, analysis is undertaken using framework of use of computer language syntax and data types rather than game mechanic concepts and other code pattern usage. -->


The concept of computational design patterns is well explored in the professional literature of computer programming and design [@gamma_design_1995], and has also been adopted by game designers [@bjork_patterns_2005]. Design patterns are well thought out solutions to common issues faced by computer programmers and system designers.

Research in this area points to challenges of teaching the abstract nature of traditionally shared design patterns related to object oriented coding languages but points to visual methods and games as promising tactics [@azimullah_evaluating_2020; @da_cruz_silva_fostering_2019]

The term game design patterns (GDP) is used in different ways. Kreimeier [@kreimeier_case_nodate] distinguishes content patterns from software engineering patterns. Software engineering patterns are used to structure code and keep it architecturally neat thus facilitating code sharing and extension. These patterns would be invisible to the end player of the game. Content patterns describe common patterns of game play and design that are visible to the player.

<!-- Indeed players may become very familiar with these GDPs as they build their literacy as players about what they like or dislike about game they play.  -->

Eriksson and colleagues [-@eriksson_using_2019] use the second interpretation rephrasing slightly as gameplay design patterns, thus placing emphasis on the exposure to the user via playing the game. They described the utility of games design patterns as a _lingua franca_ for game developers. Other benefits cited are GDP as a source of creative inspiration and as an aid to problem-solving.

Their research, which involved young people, builds on related research with adults with the explicit goal of learning game design. One product of this research is a list of GDP patterns as a public collection (available at http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/) [@bjork_patterns_2005].


MOVED TO LIT REVIEW FROM CHAPTER 5

In a design education intervention working with 11-12 year olds Eriksson and colleagues [@eriksson_using_2019] used a collection of curated patterns to prompt learners to analyse and then propose changes to an existing collaborative game called Stringforce. It is useful to compare the supports and approach of Eriksson's Stringforce study with that of the 3M intervention of this study.

The overall goal of the analysis of GDPs also differ, in the 3M study the principle goal is analysis of the use of GDPs by learners to aid their goals in creating their own games. In Eriksson's study the principle goals to is to address the perceived "challenge how to make results from research work related to this within Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) field easily transferable to future CCI research." [@baykal_using_2019]
The Stringforce study involved learner analysis of games, the ability to change level design via graphical editor and co-design of proposed conceptual changes to existing games. Unlike 3M it did not involved the learners then adding new patterns to games using code.

One similarity is the number of patterns presented to learners. In this iteration of the study 3M presented 20 patterns in the menu of options and the Stringforce study selected 14. Their selection criteria for patterns to include in co-design stages included the following concerns; concrete patterns were favoured over more abstract ones to aid the learner comprehension, patterns chosen matched the learners' capabilities, patterns that were game mechanics were also prioritised as were pattern suggested by the learners.




### Using professional frameworks to help novice game makers

This section examines the use of potential use of these professional tools or processes in an educational context.

#### Using pattern collections and code examples to help novice students.


**There is evidence in literature that the use of a collection of design patterns, while primarily used in professional settings, can help barriers faced by novice coders.**

Werner and Denner built an ambitious assessment elements into a two year programme using Alice to make games. They built a software tool to quantify the levels of computational thinking, using a structure of thinking algorithmically [@werner_fairy_2012].
The results - a limited use of standard CT concepts by students - led them to also investigate the use of students of game mechanics as well as more traditional CS constructions [@werner_children_2012]. They began to identify use of design patterns and then combination of those patterns into large game mechanics.


To help revolve the play paradox - of learner choice vs subject exploration [@hoyles_pedagogy_1992] Franklin and friends suggest the use of the UMC framework [@franklin_analysis_2020].
Other work from UMC proponent Lytle suggests a list of extensions to choose from swapping create for choose [@lytle_use_2019-1]. Based partly on the cause of teacher stress caused by the open ended nature of the "Create" part of the model.   

Other researchers  used to scaffold creation of coding projects by novices [@wang_novices_2021] and note barriers students encoutered including, mapping barriers, other

**GSM as example**

GSM created a supporting pack for teachers which used challenges themed around categorisation of game design patterns.

<!-- NOTE - RETURN TO THEIR EXTENSIVE LIST OF ERIKSSON - AND THE DESIGN CHOICE OF HOW BIG A LIST TO MAKE ESPECIALLY FOR NOVICE CODERS -->
<!-- From Eriksson article - explore in more depth in Lit Review..

Could move some of this to the results discussion -
"- Problem-Solving for Game Interaction Design: Patterns can contain various potential solutions for designers which have identified problems with specific interaction parts a game concept.
- Inspiration: Pattern collections embed gameplay concepts found useful in other games, and can therefore serve as a knowledge source for new game designs or redesigns of existing ones.
- Structured Design Tool: Both by enumerating concepts as individual patterns and by providing relations between patterns, a pattern collection can help designers to work through different levels of abstraction in a design in a structured fashion.
- Communication: The patterns offer the possibility to describe the design in a standardized format to make the understanding and comparison of different designs easier. This can be designers communicating with other designers but can also be participants discussing with other participants. The offering of a standardized format for concepts can potentially also increase the likelihood of members of heterogeneous groups being able to see each other as peers since they can communicate in a common way." -->


<!--
In my own game making model students picked missions from a choice of printed resources. There were four colour themed categories of missions. _Game mechanics_ are features to do with the actions of the game. _Game space_ patterns address the layout of the game. _Game polish_ patterns involve adding music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements. Finally _System and Challenge_ patterns look at how different elements interact to create challenge in the game. An example of a game mechanic design pattern follows. -->

## Responses to Challenges



### Suggetions from UK reports


The RSA report build on a previous report focused on providing the UK games and animation industry with the talent needed to succeed [@livingstone_next_2011].

The top recommendations were to include computer science in core curriculum, introduce a new Computing GCSE (a general exam for 16 year olds before they progress to more specialised study) exam, offer bursaries for computing teachers and to implement well-supported use of games and visual animation in the school curriculum as a way to attract more young people to the subject.



Research on inclusive approaches to digital media production  explored, outlined in Chapter 2, highlights the value of authentic projects, end products which incorporate personal creativity, and processes which incorporate a building of sense of community participation. While there is a broad consensus on how to address these issue of exclusion from computing cultures which align with the techniques of project-based learning (PBL) project work, there are contextual challenges to applying these in schools contexts.  Resnick and Rusk outline key significant challenges [-@resnick_coding_2020] including the lack of meaningful contexts, lack of time allocated preventing project approaches, and an over-reliance on rote instruction. ADD ANOTHER SOURCE HERE.


**Games in Schools**

THIS IS INTRO - SO DEVELOP OR DROP IT 
The After the Reboot report [@waite_pedagogy_2017], returned to the subject of game making as a way of increasing engagement in the process of coding. The review highlighted several areas of promise which needed more research: using games for engagement, use of design patterns - a term explored later in this chapter - and the involvement of girls in coding and social and cultural aspects of coding.  Game making aligns well with the principles of inclusive practices and project-based learning (PBL). It provides: learner choice in projects which increases motivation; authentic and shareable project outcomes to encourage peer feedback and reflection;  iterative projects work supporting student mastery; and challenging goals and guidance in goal setting aiding self-regulation in learners.





### Resource provision and CPD

The benefits of game making aligns with those of wider creative computing projects. There has been extensive publication on computing education and techniques aimed to support teachers often new to the subject. These include a new website with materials, including quick guides and writing around a set of 12 computing principles.
A lot of this literature is aimed at helping teachers in a classroom context and with a focus of explaining and exploring computing context.
MORE ON THIS - OTHER TIPS FROM NCCE AND LINKS TO RESOURCES.
BUT NOT TOO MUCH
While projects are mentioned as a principle that allows learners to deepen their understanding on computing concepts by putting them into practice. There is less on specifics of how teachers can support project work or indeed how to best develop resources to support project work in schools.

Hackathon events are characterise by a time constrained and thus accelerated production ethos. They have widened beyond code   to embrace other creative and educational domains  [@johnson_civic_2014; @kienzler_learning_2017]


The value of rapid prototyping has been popularised by Agile design techniques as a way to avoid wasted planning time. The theory being to create a minimal proof of concept and test with users.

Accelerated production methods are being applied to a wide variety of domains. Game jams draw on rapid prototyping processes, and from  hackathons they add constraints to accelerate creativity [@arya_international_2013; @gabler2005prototype].

Game Jams are an a type of hackathon where participants create games individually or in teams in a time-constrained period, typically 24 or 48 hours. Team events often take place in physical venues which may be part of a wider global Jams [@arya_international_2013]. Within Game Jams a breadth of materials are used including video games, interactive fiction, and even a Cardboard Jam [@eberhardt_no_2016].

Eberhardt also identifies potentially incompatible strands of Game Jams, specifically citing commercialised events and professional Game Jammers contrasted to those Jams with a social purpose with a more diverse, less target driven audience [@eberhardt_no_2016, p. 3].

Goddard et al have analysed the key aspects of Game Games including tools, organisational processes and rewards systems [-@goddard_playful_2014], using a playful vs. gameful spectrum from Caillois [-@caillois_man_2001]. Relevant design factors include; allowing teams to register before the event or enforcing a more playful team creation process, varied award categories which encourage diverse outcomes rather than technically structured awards and the culture of the Jam which may encourage risk taking and experimental process over commercially viable products.

Beyond the scope of more competitive Game Jams a collective of New York educators have collaborated to create a process aimed at young people that can be applied in a shorter time-frame [@games_for_change_get_2017]. Their process, the Moveable Game Jam, emphasises low-cost and both digital and analogue offline game production. The motivation is to communicate fundamentals concepts of game design process to participants.

<!-- These are broken down into; space, goal,components, mechanics and rules.  -->
<!-- The educational motivation is design and systems thinking for young people aligned with the Framework for 21st Century Learning (Gilbert,2016). -->

The Moveable Game Jam can be situated on the playful side of the spectrum in that it uses loosely structured activities and broad goals allowing for significant learner agency. Conversely, there are element of a more structured approaches in the steering of game outputs towards particular social goals, periodic facilitator checking of the fundamental concepts previously mentioned and the use of extensive playtesting in the process.

Play testing is the process of involving other participants to try out a prototype of a game early the creation process [@eladhari_design_2012]. It has a particular value in forcing an iterative approach.

Jamming, a term common in music and theatre, describes responsive, improvised, rapid and fluid responses to collaborators ideas and audience reactions [@pinheiro2011creative; @sawyer_group_2003].

The area of improvisation is under explored in game jam context compared to that of music and theatre [@jaffurs_impact_2004-1; @merilainen_game_2020].

The value of setting up playful learning environments has been explored in the context of bringing value of informal learning to environments of higher education WHITTON []. Benefits include, the reduction of learner stress, and creating a no wrong answer environment.



#### Game making studies addressing gender and race

The introduction gave a summary of some of the barriers associated with culture and identity. This section addresses those studies in more detail, extracting some of the pedagogical approaches.


**Studies exploring identity and barriers to participation**


Issues of identities and barriers have been explored in relation to gender in terms of game making in several studies.

REWRITE WITH CORRECT CITATIONS - ALSO INCLUDE THE GAME TESTERS OF BLACK STUDENTS.   

**Gender related identities**

The Girls Creating Games programme which asked similar questions concerning the impact of a Flash-based game programme on computer proficiency and desire to continue with computer studies Denner, 2007). Findings were again mixed but encouraging in some areas. While there was no increase in desire to persue computing, there were marked increases in computer related confidence, ability and a decrease in gender stereo typing around computer use.

The issues of gender stereo-typing and identity in relation to computers were explored by Pelletier as part of the Making Games project using the Mission Maker software 2008).

Data was recorded from two UK schools in an 18 month after school programme. Pelletier draws on the work of Butler 1988) to caution against overdue influence of a set conception of gender or cultural stereotypes, seeing gender as a personal and flexible product of continuing activities and interactions. In this study, she explored the promise of the process of game design and the analysis of gaming habits as a platform and set of tools for young participants to explore and construct their gender identity over time. This area is a rich seam to explore and a more recent study by Fisher and Jenson critically explored diverse themes through a summer game making programme 2017). Emerging issues included pinkification, marginalisation and exclusions of women from game cultures, sexualisation and harassment.

Kafai and Burke also address the issues of gender identities and game design 2014). They propose that we ask not *How can we bring girls into the game making clubhouse* but rather *How can we build new clubhouses suitable for the interests of girls*. Two of the playful elements they suggest are textiles related technology and the promotion of more collaborative online spaces as opposed to technology competitions.


  - girl's low self-confidence in the area of computing compared to their ability [@beyer_gender_2003; @margolis_unlocking_2002]

**Research**
Extensive research by Roberson on game making in schools measured gender differences in performance and attitudes to game making and computing in pre post tests [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_influence_2013].  

The findings were mixed as while girls outperformed boys in use of computational structures, neither gender ended the programme with a greater desire to learn more about computers in the future.

The Girls Creating Games programme which asked similar questions concerning the impact of a Flash-based game programme on computer proficiency and desire to continue with computer studies [@denner_girls_2007] . Findings were again mixed but encouraging in some areas. While there was no increase in desire to persue computing, there were marked increases in computer related confidence, ability and a decrease in gender stereo typing around computer use.


Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  



**Addressing Race related identities**

### 5th Dimension Case Study

Insert a summary of context, motivation and some of the processes to address cultural issues in 5th dimension project

A case studey from a socio-cultural perspective is exemplified by the 5th Dimension (5D) project led by Michael Cole [@cole_design-based_2016]. This educational intervention used University support of volunteers, equipment and technical support in after-school settings in the San Diego area.

The intervention introduced a fictional narrative to create a shared 'project' for the different participants involved to promote a shared understanding of the work via intentional goal setting [@brown_cultural_2008].

In the 5D intervention, a narrative fiction of a 'wizard' to rapidly construct a shared sense of the guiding activities. In similar approach to Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert, roles are created and breathed into life by the facilitator and affordances of the learning design to accelerate an adoption of principles of practice.

This technique emerged in this study as one of value and is explored in chapters x and y.

### Creative Family Learning - Roque

<!-- As Amy Bruckman pointed out, "tools are not enough... Tools are effectively constructionist only when they are embedded in a constructionist culture." (Bruckman, 1998, pp. 51-52) -->

There is limited research on how to create learning communities making games for educational purposes. Existing research [@xiao_fostering_2007] has close parallels with project approaches and has a focus on fostering online collaboration and resources sharing. Many popular and well researched online communities exist [scratch, itch.io, new grounds](Bruckman). However researchers [@roque_family_2016] highlighted the limitations of accessibility of online participatory culture. In response Roque [@roque_family_2016]  FCL study addressed it with face to face session with help from family members.  


Roque's work is founded on sociocultural / situated understandings of learning and brings it into a non-formal learning environment. A key question she asks is how can facilitators help develop participation in community activities [@roqueBecomingFacilitatorsCreative2018].


It is of value to explore the community aspect of providing support to parents, and support and structure to staff members supporting parents.

The work of Roque to operationalise Barron's work on parental roles in a making context is of particular interest to this study.

I extend this in this study, how can the learning design contribute to aid this process and empower young people as well.

START COMMUNITY ACTIVITY.  -->


## Synthesis of chapter / discussion






**Building learner identities to address Inequalities**

One significant element of in this process is learner perception of their own limits.
EXPLORE RESEARCH HERE.

### Deficit of cultural processes & appropriate frameworks to support community-based coding for beginners  

There is a lack of knowledge of cultural processes & appropriate frameworks to structure a project / community based approach  

There is no consensus of what abstract concepts support development of coding practices

There is a also a need for concrete frameworks for novices in initial stages, that is understandable and relatable.

Thus, not wanting to detract from abstract frameworks, or set up a false dichotomy between approaches, there is still a need for more concrete frameworks that work in tandem with PBL methods.

These framweorks can be useful for diverse reasons: providing useful navigation in terms of pedagogy pedagogy, supporting positive affect in crucial early stages, building positive identity as a code creator, and aligning with UDL framework and recommendations for inclusive practice.


#### Supporting roles and social practices to support learners

The tension between autonomous participation in a naturalistic on structured facilitated support is one that is also explored in the extensive literature exploring project based approaches. Here advocates of this approach promote the value of open-ended, authentic projects while critics highlight that without support that collaboration is difficult between learners and thus needs to be scaffolded with structured activities and taught input
[@kirschner_why_2006; @kollar_collaboration_2006]

I mention this as the literature surrounding the mature field of Project Based Learning may be a good source of inspiration for tactics to address issues of scaling

Roque makes a convincing case for the unpicking of the supportive and collaborative roles of parents and facilitators to build this capacity and awareness of family learning roles. However, while the design of the FCL programme was effective to build parental confidence and increase overall accessibility, it left questions about the effectiveness of the process to enable learning at home.

We can compare the difficulties of scaling of this hybrid setting (FCL) with more structured, and more naturalistic learning environments. It can be tempting to see the process of hanging out line in the frame of Ito's online and social participation in informal communities as infinitely replicable. Such online communities are out there. It is up to learner to navigate and extract learning and skills as they see fit.


### Tensions surrounding authenticity of tool use

**Key message: authentic tools and processes can increase agency but facilitators should use them with careful curation - as there are negative effects too**

Rainer, Bolton and other practitioner-researchers agree on the potential and value of exploring other subject matter - e.g.  literacy, maths, science and history -  and undertaking authentic project work within a drama frame [-@rainer_drama_2012].

This authenticity has several relevant dimensions in this study including: audience; toolset; and supportive processes / documentation. This section explores the these dimensions of authenticity and the resulting relationships with agency of the learners.

PBL is adapted to schools in many settings thus, authenticity is "on a scale" in PBL  The concept of an authentic-as-possible project is a key tool for educators to support game making via project based learning [find support]. One advatange of working with digital tools is that if issues of complexity and cost can be addressed access to laptops and the internet allow learners to use very similar production tools to professionals.





<!-- - audience
- tools
- processes (professional and peers ?)
- shared concepts - link to GDPs as a big one -->
  <!-- An unusual approach so why?
  - involvement with mozilla / teach the web
  - authenticity - link between developer community and education, global in scope
  - can use a cut and paste, remix, irreverant approach - link to media activist / hacktivist pirate cultures.

Research on project based learning using technology supports the motivational and inspirational factors of authentic tools in the fields of STEM computing [@garneli_computing_2015-1; @humble_use_nodate], media making and STEM in general. [IF SO FIND THIS ]

<!-- The inspirational factor of _lifting the lid_ was reflected in a conversation among participants communicating a sense of awe of how much code must be involved in a professional game based on the relative complexity of the code of their simple game. -->

## Barriers to participation in game making practices (explored in contextual settings)

This section review existing research on digital making to identify barriers to participation in digital making and in particular coding practices in key contexts.

While the primary focus of this thesis is on an emerging coding community in a non-formal learning environment, the wider implications and learners should be applicable in school settings. There are however existing institutional barriers to this happening in traditional school classrooms. To address this,  the next section explores these barriers in a UK context of computing and digital skills school-based education.

### Institutional Barriers - related to UK School context


- Change of exam in to computing in 2014


A change driven by x


A section on the promise of the curriculum, and the hobby based activities created by individuals and non-profits to support project based work. However, in 201X, the coursework element of GSCE exam, which allowed students to engage with hands on coding, was rapidly removed due to student accessing 'worked examples' of code solutions online and incorporating them into their.

As students are able to write in psuedo code this means




### Technical Barriers -  Difficulties in learning to program

Summary here [@gomes2007learning] [@joao_cross-analysis_2019]. and here

    <!-- Through a literature review on this topic, we aim to organize and   systematize the main difficulties into four dimensions of analysis: (i) subject and complexity of languages; (ii) technologies and applications; (iii) teachers and teaching methodologies; and (iv) pupils’ skills[@joao_cross-analysis_2019] -->

In particular, the dilemma between more authentic languages and block based approaches [@joao_cross-analysis_2019].

More literature which examines the complexity of language and development environments should be found here.

Complexity of syntax and problem of leading with syntax [@gomes2007learning]

Issues of needing levels of abstraction in learning programming [@gomes2007learning].


*Specialist coding tools and computational kits*

There may software and hardware kits aimed at novice coders and in particular younger audience [@yu_survey_2018].

This section briefly summarises some of the adaptation in particular, that software has undergone to adapt to this audience.

Much work has been taken out by MIT family developing Papert's ideas on constructionism in tool use

 - Block coding vs text coding, syntax
 - Design principles for game making tools, [@kafai_connected_2016; @resnick_reflections_2005] ()
 - Barriers in using support material for code examples- mapping, understanding, [@wang_novices_2021]


Scratch and GSM merit particular examination as mini-case studies. The  

- Scratch and community element.
- Remix as a feature: [@amanullah_evaluating_2019]
- Online log in
- library of assets to speed up creation
- In built asset authoring tools.

Game star Mechanic added quest ability, and a narrative set in a steam punk aesthetic. Of interest to this study are the motivational use of narrative, and accompanying resources which help analysis of game design patterns and systems based challenges.

NOTE - referenced in design chapter - the alignment with the use of code playground and template.

### Cultural / Identity barriers to participation in ...

**Barriers to participation**

Develop from introduction, move to a overview of literature which addresses  barriers in participation in coding communities from literature.

The focus of this review is to identify broad streams and currents in research.


#### Barrier - Identity and computer cultures

Early work from Papert and Turkle addresses cultural barriers to computing culture [-@papert_epistemological_1990]. The distinction between hard and soft approaches to learning is explored particularly in studies refuting conceptions that there is a right way to do computer coding. In this context, the hard approach infers a top-down perspective, highlighting advance planning and logical deconstruction of large problems. Papert and Turkle identify the privileging of abstract thinking over concrete approaches in classroom teaching a tendency which is mirrored by recent conceptions and advancement of computational thinking as teaching ideology [@wing_computational_2008].

Paper and Turkle locate different, softer but equally effective coding strategies. Soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner-directed connection with the materials or digital artefacts involved. The learner is presented as adapting a familiar set of concepts and processes to new situations and challenges as they arise as a 'tinker' might use well worn tools to skilfully bodge a repair job [@papert_childrens_1993, p. 143].

Kafai and Peppler also address the issues of gender identities and game design [@kafai_beyond_2014] asking how to create new communities and learning environments which align with values of participants rather than aiming to break into existing ones. They propose that we ask not *How can we bring girls into the game making clubhouse* but rather *How can we build new clubhouses suitable for the interests of girls*. Two of the playful elements they suggest are textiles related technology and the promotion of more collaborative online spaces as opposed to technology competitions.

<!-- #### Barrier - Unfamiliarity with design process due to instruction based schooling systems

When faced with choice learners are sometimes unsure how to start creating.
Design scaffolds have been created to support this. -->




### Barrier - unfamiliarity with support practices

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].





### Outlining  cultural barriers / aspects of game making

The following studies are explored future in LR. Here I surface cultural barriers experienced by participants.


**Gender  related identities**
- Important to caution against gender stereo-typing and identity in relation to computers [@pelletier_gaming_2008]
- study by Fisher and Jenson critically explored diverse themes through a summer game making programme 2017). Emerging issues included pinkification, marginalisation and exclusions of women from game cultures, sexualisation and harassment.

**Race related identities**

In study by Thayter and Ko [@thayer_barriers_2017] the work of Margolis et al is analysed using concepts from communities of practice, type of barriers, and personal obstacles [@margolis_stuck_2008;]

    Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race and Computing by Margolis, Estrella, et al. [ 12] examined the racial gap in high school CS, finding barriers that included lack of access to classes (formal boundary), cultural expectations on who the classes were for, feelings of isolation in classes, divisions within classes between those who “have it or don’t have it” (informal boundaries), and lack of social support(personal obstacle). Additional studies found participation and success in computing programs depended on background experience [ 2, 27 ], comfort level [ 27 ], sense of belonging and stereotypes (dis proportionately negatively affecting women) [ 2 , 5, 10, 16 ], view of self as an “insider” [21], and believed role of luck [27]

Glitch game testers [@disalvo_saving_2014; @disalvo_glitch_2009-1; @disalvo_learning_2008]

**Outro**

Illingworth critique's Kafai and Burke's book due to lack of specificity in the game making techniques outlined. This is particularly the case in chapter x which explores cultural elements of game making research. In recent years the constructionist school has taken care to start to describe cultural elements of learning environments [EVIDENCE]. Other approaches exist - AT etc .





## Game making and coding and in schools and formal education

The most prominent learning objective of making games in educational setting is to develop _coding and computing skills_. There are extensive studies on _game making to learn other subjects_ including maths, biology and chemistry but diverse examples exist. Game making can also develop social skills, self-reflection, cultural awareness and a range of technical abilities that allow participation in information society.

They are also a powerful vehicle for exploring issues involving race, sex, social issues [@tekinbas_quest_2010].

While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research.


The context of many studies of game making to learning either computer science or other subject knowledge in curricular for the most part happens in a school or after school environment.




### Coding and Computing as a School Subject in the UK

The influential report "Next Gen: Transforming the UK into the world’s leading talent hub for the video games and visual effects industries" was focused on providing the UK games and animation industry with the talent needed to succeed [@livingstone_next_2011]. The top recommendations were to include computer science in core curriculum, introduce a new Computing GCSE (a general exam for 16 year olds before they progress to more specialised study) exam, offer bursaries for computing teachers and to implement well-supported use of games and visual animation in the school curriculum as a way to attract more young people to the subject.

- New curriculum
- bursaries
- CPD

Financial elements in general, lack of specialist funding addressed by training CPD funding for schools.
But the effectiveness of this  is limited in teh following ways. Time, enthusiasm,  

**Games in Schools**

The After the Reboot report [@waite_pedagogy_2017], returned to the subject of game making as a way of increasing engagement in the process of coding. The review highlighted several areas of promise which needed more research: using games for engagement, use of design patterns - a term explored later in this chapter - and the involvement of girls in coding and social and cultural aspects of coding. The "After the Reboot" report also contained concerning observations. The report found that girls, ethnic minorities, and students of lower socio-economic status were all less likely to take computing as a subject at GCSE level. Game making aligns well with the principles of inclusive practices and project-based learning (PBL). It provides: learner choice in projects which increases motivation; authentic and shareable project outcomes to encourage peer feedback and reflection;  iterative projects work supporting student mastery; and challenging goals and guidance in goal setting aiding self-regulation in learners.


<!-- The benefits of game making aligns with those of wider creative computing projects. There has been extensive publication on computing education and techniques aimed to support teachers often new to the subject. These include a new website with materials, including quick guides and writing around a set of 12 computing principles.
A lot of this literature is aimed at helping teachers in a classroom context and with a focus of explaining and exploring computing context.
MORE ON THIS - OTHER TIPS FROM NCCE AND LINKS TO RESOURCES.
BUT NOT TOO MUCH
While projects are mentioned as a principle that allows learners to deepen their understanding on computing concepts by putting them into practice. There is less on specifics of how teachers can support project work or indeed how to best develop resources to support project work in schools. -->
<!-- One of the recommended strategies is a Game Jam which focuses on real life issues.

## Context of game making and wider digital making and culture home and informal settings

The context of informal communities is important to situate in summary.

Making games that will be played by audience of friends and family and using tools used beyond the scope of education, professional communities.  


In this study the focus on historical and cultural artefacts and practices brought by Rogoff, and in particular the concept of guided participation, originated in non-school settings, is helpful.   

<!-- However, the concept has been used to analyse participation in non-formal and formal settings.
The following studies are relevant:

- guided participation framed in media literacy @aarsand_appropriation_2016. -->




### On games as a home and informal culture

The work of Livingstone is foundational in the area of home learning of digital technologies [@livingstone_digital_2018] uncovering a rich repertoire concepts and practices that families may bring into a non-formal game making process.

Retro gaming has a place in our society's public memory [@heineman2014public]. For this study I use a definition of early arcade games from the 1970s and early 1980s and early generation of home consoles before the advent of 3D graphics. Retro games have a particular aesthetic driven by graphical limitations and the simplified game mechanics which are due to the limited capabilities of the hardware and storage space involved.

<!-- One of the reasons that I was interested to shift to game making was the potential that seemed to be present for intergenerational work based around retro gaming based on its place in public memory [@heineman_public_nodate]. The place in public memory of retro games is complex but for older participants, the effect of nostalgia is significant. -->


Ito's work on  and naturalistic studies of digital use and creativity in the home including the value of informal playing around [@ito_connected_2013-1; @ito_hanging_2010], and Gee and the process of tapping into affinity groups and affinity spaces [@gee_what_2004].  Gee's (2004b) work on games and associated culture as learning experiences is founded on his understanding of how the engender a shared discourse and emerging identities.

In addition, maker culture more generally is relevant due to the alignment with tinkering as educational practice in stem education, supported by family involvement and brokering of experiences. The details of tinkering as a pedagogical practice are explored in more detail in the literature review of this thesis.


Casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014].


Building on the concept of participatory culture [@jenkins_confronting_2009], where x and y, there are several streams of activity that are important to reference as foundational context for this study.



### Context of Home Education and family learning

NOTE SEE THIS SUMMARY - WHICH MUST BE IN HERE SOMEWHERE TOO - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1grMat_sXRLdlRSDtR17Lyxf1OAg3ZpOxTWfnDZ3kkIU/edit

The move to family learning as a context suited the trajectory of my interests and the opportunities available as part of University context.

Many professional programmers began with support provided by family.

Barron and Livingstone have outlined the advantages and processes involved in family involvement of technology use and learning in the home.

There is clearly an inequality of access to these well paid profession that the development of the computing curriculum and the skills based and creative process focus that was part of the initial narrative is laudable the aims of equality.

However the practical and and cultural difficulties of undertaking a project-based approach within the curriculum are significant. Factors of difficulties associated with technology projects compound difficulties.

In this research I made the decisions not to focus on the adaptation of a  informal club approach to the restrictions of in-school classes but rather instead to embrace key elements of it and to explore processes in situ
My involvement with home ed networks stemmed from University outreach work.  

While the context of home education is not a core to the goals of this research it is important to situate this study accurately.


**Outline of the home eduction context of this study:** The processes and motivations driving of home education are varied [@fensham-smith_invisible_2021]. Classic ideas of reasons for HE include pedagogy and ideology [@galen_home_1991] [@rothermel_can_2003], and often both.
- Unschooling, Holt, drawing out interests of children in everyday activities and facilitating learning around that [@gray_challenges_2013]
- Webs of learning Illich - home ed families active in identifying networks to tap into [@doroudi_relevance_2023] has a relevance with social networking groups and email lists used by home educators to share and align activities.


## Game making and maker culture in non-formal learning contexts and third spaces


### Physical spaces which suit non-formal approaches

Much research on game making focused on non-class room settings.

For example Papert's work

Digital learning in IILP (GLAM settings) is fertile [@degner_digital_2022; @schwan_understanding_2014]



#### An area of tension to address - limited leaner choice in process if driven by curriculum.

Authors note that UMC and the value of project based exploration can clash with classroom culture driven by curriculum goals.

    "Constructionist learning experiences are often designed to give the learner agency in the activity, encouraging exploration throughout the process of constructing public and shareable artifacts [16, 26]. The open-endedness can be difficult to adhere to when used in a context where there are specific learning objectives or when trying to introduce new conceptual material or practices. Noss & Hoyles [24] call this the Play Paradox, an inherent tension between supporting a freedom of exploration while constraining the activity to ensure specific concepts or practices are encountered."
    Quote from [@franklin_analysis_2020]





 <!-- To address this Summary of what is in Ch.3 -->

<!-- While RQ3 is necessarily limited in the extent it directly addresses forms of agency. The surfacing of my conflicted understandings of the experimental change need to acknowledged here for context as they do emerge in the way I locate the findings in relation to other research in later chapters. -->


### Sketchy pedagogies

The messiness and sketchiness of my preferred  learning experience were also somehow important for me to preserve and to investigate as part of this study. This is present in the mutually evolving nature of the methodology of the study, as represented in design based learning.  

The process of launching into the unknown with project involving a group of people hoping to collectively make some kind of progress towards a sketchy goal was something familiar to me but under-explored.  Dave Gray's Gamestorming resource [gray_gamestorming_2010] (which became a guiding principle of EdLab project work) outlined a principle of fuzzy goals adapted from Blackwell's work [blackwell_radical_2009]

The process aligns with mutuality of design work and acknowledgement that while the process can seem a bit sketchy the results which incorporate ideas from diverse participants, also build a collective understanding of the problem area among participants which is as valuable as the proposed solution. It can also avoid unforeseen consequences by a more rapid adjustment in the course of a project.

In addition, recent work on transformative agency within socio-cultural frameworks offers promising theoretical support.
A special issue of Mind and Culture [@kajamaa_young_2019] focuses on young people, digital mediation, and transformative agency.

SUMMARY OF PROMISE OF DBR TO REFLECT SKETCHYNESS




<!-- I also problematise educational projects beyond the sometimes superficial take on educational project in schools with wider concepts derived from the socio cultural tradition. -->

<!-- This process links back to my own feelings of entrapment, powerlessness and guilt after being involved with wider activist movements and projects. I want to be able to give detailed tools of critically analysis that do not paralyse but also do not unthinkingly evangelise social change in ways which may be unsafe or unrealistic. -->








### Funds of knowledge and third space

The concept of funds of knowledge (FoK) emerged from research within United States Latino communities. FoK refers to knowledge that household members have gained as part of their lived experience and social practices [@moll_funds_1992].

In the original study home visits were carried out to better inform design of after-school activities.

However there limits to this approach, including only some families were visited, and adult focused nature of process [@rajala_utopian_2023].  

The term addresses the use of knowledge and skills from participation in activities outside school that teachers can build on to help classroom work and to support the motivation of learners. Researchers found that Latino home cultures, skills and traditions were hardly visible in mainstream school cultures. This resulted in a form of deficit thinking about the performance of these communities [@moll_funds_1992].

### Third spaces and the context of this study

The concept of third space is helpful in the context of this study in particular as a space between home life and formal education.

It also is rooted in a sociocultural understanding of learning that is challenging to traditional classroom environments.

### Game making as a fund of knowledge

Research by the UK National Literacy Trust [-@picton_video_2020] of 11-16 year olds found that 96% percent of boys and 65.2% of girls play video games. This study shows that while there remains a disparity between genders, game playing is still very widespread and young people are unlikely to be part of a household where no games are played.

Game making allows children to draw on funds of knowledge in various ways, perhaps in the choice of the kind of game that is to be made, in the setting or subject matter or the style and aesthetics of audio and visual elements of the game.

Teachers can also draw out attitudes and knowledge of game cultures and bring them into the learning environment in an inclusive way. In addition, knowledge of game design conventions can be used by teachers to exemplify coding concepts. For example, consider conditional coding constructs. If Pac-Man touches a ghost, then a player life is lost. Such structures are described as a game design patterns. Werner and colleagues [-@denner_using_2014] found that the use of design patterns and game mechanics when teaching novice coders can increase accessibility for learners due the concrete and relatable approach.


#### Play circles and MOE as a third space

The concept arose in research of this PhD, however it resonated with my past work on forum theatre, art activism and performant art.

A foundation of link between between play theory, MOE and third space theory.

A detailed analysis is beyond remit of this review but broad alignments include:
- use of concept of a new creative space for all participants
- use of mediated strategies to reduce learner stress
- ability to bring self identify to share in a scaffolded and protected way



### Work in non-formal settings drawing on home interests

The work aligns with STEM work on tinkering which mobilises home interests in non-formal settings.

The practices of code patching and remixing are authentic skills used by professional coders who find and combine existing code libraries rather than coding everything from scratch.



### Mozilla - Teach the Web as context and community

A Mozilla white paper [@mozilla_foundation_webmaker_2014] outlines the power of exploring web technology as an empowering activity.

In 2011 I co-wrote an open web collaboratively with other authors as part of a collaborative writing process called Book Sprint (model on code sprints and other corroborative  processes). One of the co-writer Michelle Thorne went on to work with Mozilla as part of their teach the web and web literacy programme. One of her posts is a good illustration of the kinds of activities drawing on home interests to explore authentic web technologies, and some of the digital literacy elements needed to be an effective citizen of the web. https://michellethorne.cc/2015/03/clubs-web-literacy-basics-curriculum/

The tools created by Mozilla to investigate and to remix HTML pages scaffolded the experiences of new learners and paralleled my own early experiences of self-expression through hacking a new technology.

Like Michelle, my path had shifted towards a younger audience.  

As part of my PGCE studies I developed some teaching materials for the Mozilla Foundation as part of the Teach the Web programme. I write a course called Quacking Javascript. My report on the underlying pedagogical approach outlines the following possibilities; playful approach, use of online games, use of popular culture references to increase engagement [@chesterman_webmaking_2015].

My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics and Scratch.


 <!-- This programme introduced a broad set of competencies name Web Literacies including; digital literacy
- web literacy - narrower
- webmaker - and more specific affordances of key web based coding and exploring tools -->


### Authentic web technology & Code playgrounds
<!-- Javascript is an authentic language, core the web. Phaser is a professional and enthusiast framework.  -->

<!-- Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals. -->


<!-- Aligning with the activities of Nicola Whitton exploring the rules and components of games in a playful way. -->

Later in this thesis I problematise the use of the work authentic in learning [@lee_none_2016].

In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity. The motivation was to align to authentic web technology due to my previous experience. The reason for working with code this authentic bears exploration. Characteristics of broader dimensions of authenticity of tools and processes in learning environments are explored in the literature review. A brief summary being: similarity to workplace settings; facilitating activity which serves a need of participants; an ability to showcased resulting work to an audience [@shaffer_thick_1999; @warr_bridging_2020]. While my choice of open source digital tools allowed for a high level of aligning with professional practices, it was also potentially complex in terms of use of tools. In part my motivation for choice of code language (Javascript, Phaser) was driven by desire to align with common workplace practices and to be potentially extensible for future student-led web projects.

#### Code playgrounds - TOO SPECIFIC? MOVE OR SUMMARISE AND MERGE UP

Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals. In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity and thus an ability . My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics.

MOVE TO LR.
The process of running web code can be complicated by setting up a server environment locally to test and then finding a live webserver and the complexity of transferring files to the server via FTP/SSH processes. . Code playground allow users to circumvent such problems. While originally designed more for problem solving, a service more recent code playgrounds provide is to act as a more permanent host for web projects.  

In their brand style and selected  picks of projects, many code playgrounds celebrate and encourage a playful spirit of creativity and sharing.

<!-- NOTE  - I loved FTP and feel nostalgic? perhaps rfer back to that in conclusion? -->

<!-- DROPPED -  There are strong parallels in this presentation to that Scratch community and to the sharing ethos integral to the maker-movement (explored in Lit Review). The interplay between play and work via shared experimentation is developed further in a later discussion chapter. -->

<!-- #### Other online asset creation tools

There are other ways to create assets online. Piskel is a pixel graphics editor, audio creation of assets. These tools are provided by a mix of enthusiast coders and communities of game makers. ### Mozilla, Webmaking and code playgrounds

#### Phaser.js

While the Webmaker program was discontinued and the end of a funding cycle, ongoing core work of Mozilla to provide resources for webdevelopers. One strand of this is game development using javascript  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games

Mozilla chose phaser as a javascript library/ framework (see Glossary). Phaser is a javascript framework embedded in html page. Unlike many game making tools this tools set can be extended to other kinds of projects and is a professional and foundational toolset used to build the majority of websites and many phone applications.

#### Summary of authenticity- COMMENT OR MOVE

Javascript as coding language, Phaser as a game making framework and Glitch as a code environment, are highly authentic and used by both professional coders and enthusiasts alike. -->




### Mantle of the Expert - processes drama used in teaching technology

A way of leveraging some of the processes outline above in a schooling context.

The salient features of MoE.
    Broadly speaking, Mantle of the Expert draws on three teaching modalities: inquiry learning; drama for learning (closely related to dramain-education, or, as it is sometimes called, process drama); and what we might call “expert framing” [@aitken_dorothy_2013].

Heathcote discusses authenticity in detail in her writings [@heathcote_dorothy_1984].
The focus on authenticity,  to align  needs interest and object interests - see notes - and the creative work of the facilitator to align them
In an illustrative case study on computing the needs interests are to respond to the percieved authentic need of a scenario, and the object interest was the subject matter of learning to the computer system to carry out a task.

Writing in role or writing in action is a technique used in MoE [@hinton_workplace-focused_nodate]

Rainer and Bolton explore some of the rigidity of the MoE approach in terms of time allocated and other factors. Rainer outlines a wider scope of a process drama [-@rainer_drama_2012].


**Other forms of process dramas and STEM education**

MoE is one form of  other process drama. Others exist. They share similar aims. MoE can be seen as formulaic [@rainer_drama_2012], or prohibitively time consuming [@heathcote_drama_1994].

Rainer chapter [@rainer_drama_2012] also highlights authenticity in different phases, both in activity and in assessment to aid metacognition.

Existing research shows value in STEM education to address barriers associated with identity issues [@fields_picking_2013; @gill_process_2012].

My own work with Manchester Met University drama education department explored the value of coding in role.  [@caldwell_drama_2019]
