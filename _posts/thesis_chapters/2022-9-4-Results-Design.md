## Evolution of Design

This chapter charts the evolution of the learning design. It draws on immediate analysis of participants reactions and contributions from journal notes, participant interviews and analysis of changes in the learning resources created.

The first section is a short summary of the phases of the design. IS THIS OVERLAP WITH PREVIOUS CHAPTER?
It is framed within DBR language and concepts. HOW TO DO THIS?

The second part explores tensions and resolutions to those tensions using language of AT.

One result is that working on Game Design Patterns are the main unit of Activity. See Blunden to frame this and to describe the utility of the idea  [@blundenInterdisciplinaryConceptActivity2009; @blundenGermCellUnit2014].


The third part starts to analyse the functions of these responses using the 3 foci of Rogoff 3 planes model.

### Description of Phases

I have carried out four stages of workshops and development with home educator families. I will outline activities that have taken place at each stage of activity and include some early results.

- Oct 2017 - Mar 2018: Experimental Course
- May 2018 - Dec 2018: Resource Development Stage
- Jan 2019 - Dec 2019: Glitch Game Club
- Jan 2020 - May 2020: Make Code Arcade

See [Summary Table of Stages](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBoXJWw-aZUcc8EsAvT195CtHLSM468YOCD0sGzOuoA/edit#)


#### Phase One - Initial Experimentation

This phase took place before the official start of this research and relevant ethics application. As such, this stage was initially aimed not at collecting user data rather than building my own background knowledge and competency.

However, may of the key foundations of the ongoing design starting to take shape at this point.

- Play testing of other games and their own.
- Use of drama / warm up games


#### Phase Two - Resource Development Stage

The first phase of delivery in late 2018 was based on initial research stage; I drew on literature to identify factors to consider when designing for collaboration. I adopted an open project based approach which integrated drama games to aid group bonding and reflection.

I chose a tool set which drew on relevant design principles explored earlier (Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013).

The tools allow participants to create games using a combination of a free to use online tools. They comprise a coding environment using the phaser javascript game library (glitch.com), a pixel art editor (piskelapp.com), and a sound effect generator (sfbgames.com/chiptone).

 One of the principles that I prioritised in the choice of tools was that of immediate feedback for participants. For example, in the code editing interface of glitch.com shown in Illustration 1, changes made to the code on the left section take immediate effect in the resultant game on the right side of the screen.

In terms of supporting resources, stage one was exploratory and responsive; I had no pre-existing supporting materials and created a starting code framework of a platform game and code examples to add extra functionality to the game as the programme developed.

At the end of this stage participants showed their games to students in the foyer of the MMU Brooks building and gave me feedback on their participation in the programme.

#### Phase Three - Glitch Game Club

The third phase in early 2019 drew on this participant feedback and detailed reading of relevant literature to bring substantial changes to the programme. While still driven by participant interests, it took a more structured approach. The resources included small scale starting challenges as A5 hand-outs, step-by-step tutorials as print outs, and code examples as online projects illustrating key additions to the game.

I brought the workshops resources together a book published on the FLOSS Manuals documentation platform (Chesterman, 2019) and an online project-hub linking to all resources (Chesterman and Potts, 2019). In the first iteration the hub linked to self contained games which contained code examples of game design patterns.


<!-- I also carried out four video-recorded interviews with practitioners who work with creative methods and technology with young people or families. Early analysis of these interviews has helped shape the evolving design of my programme and has brought into focus key areas of interest already identified in journal entries. -->


I also began the data gathering of . I recorded all interactions via use of 360 camera and screen capture of workstations and undertook post-course interviews with participants. Work on analysis of this data is contained in early results section below.

Second iteration in May 2019 I drew on previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department [@pattersonDramaSTEM2019] to create a simple drama process to give a simple external motivation and narrative to the creation of games for a fictional audience of visiting aliens.

I revised the  an online project-hub to link to the project chapters rather than the code examples.

#### Phase Four - MakeCode Arcade
(Jan 2020 - May 2020)

I ran two iterations of game making course of 5-6 weeks using MakeCode Arcade tool. The template, resources and facilitation approach was based closely on the previous stages using glitch.com.

However, there were some additional changes in the way that design patterns were presented to learners.

### Evolution of game template and supporting resources


### Description of Tensions Emerging

The following are a list of tensions observed in early game making experiments that I recorded in journal form. More likely have some starting tensions from early design stages, that are then analysed in relation to other sources and data, and other resolutions that are more general or sophisticated emerge.

**Learner disengagement if game coding is taught in an instructionist / from first principles (especially in younger ages)** - Learners start with a minimal game to improve. Using a template to increase speed of feedback from learner input.

**Learner frustration if they are not able to choose what feature they add to the game next:** Present a wide range of different kinds of design patterns that learners can add to their game in the order they choose (with some exceptions). This facilitates engagement and motivation.

**Teacher stress if they are not able to support a very diverse set of features demanded by students working on diverse kinds of games.**-  

Limit the type of game to one kind. Offer a significant but limited menu of missions that users can add. Offer written and visual support documents which learners can access independently of facilitators

**Learners take on features which are too advanced or complex for their current coding level**
Limit the maximum complexity of missions and present patterns to encourage learners to start with ones that involve simple code changes but return a large change in terms of gameplay experience.

**Facilitators may have a more linear and limited view of ‘progress’ than learners:**

Side missions which explore and celebrate different ‘maker types’ (informed by Bartle’s player types) can provide the opportunity to discuss characteristics of different making/design approaches.  

**Systems concepts are embedded in many games but the process of direct teaching of such systems can be complex and interrupt and distract from other design activities.**

Extra missions which highlight game challenge and user experience may help learners to explore systems concepts within the game context

**Parents may feel a lack of confidence in taking part in coding activities which they have little cultural connection to**.
Side missions which explore and celebrate both Bartle player types and


**Facilitators may need to justify learning happening and struggle to see this in-situ if unfamiliar with the game making process. This may restrict openness of activities to better assess and support learning.**
A map of learning dimensions flexibly linked to main missions/patterns can be used by both learners and facilitators.

**If it is not recorded, learners and facilitators may lose track of what has been covered in the process of making a game. Thus reducing opportunities for project reflection. However, stopping activity to record formally interrupts the enjoyment of game making.**
Tracing the learner pathway on an attractive physical map in the learning space can help integrate navigation and reflection into the creative process.


**Learners may not find coding a project a motivating project if it is only a private activity with no end audience.**
Play Testing - each lesson can help with short term motivation of having a game product ready  for others to play.  Showcase events help longer-term motivation towards and aid prioritisation as learners near the end of their project.

**Learners may feel alienated from coding as a practice and need a way into the process.**
Drama and fictional scenarios can help explore issues and reduce learner anxiety though coding in a role.

**Learners interact with code primarily using the mouse keyboard and screen which does not take advantage of benefits of physical computing for learner engagement.**
Connecting arcade buttons to the computer via simple electronics is a project which can be completed quickly. The process of students building their own arcade cabinets for a games showcase increased their perception of the authenticity of their end goal

## Analysing learner responses to design

The first part of this chapter has dealt with the evolution of design in initial phases and responses to learner experience to resolve tensions. Due to the complexity and many moving parts of the design it has been mostly descriptive.

While CHAT provides the technique of highlighting emerging tensions and resolutions, to undertake deeper analysis I will an analytical process proposed by Rogoff which examines learning communities using 3 foci.

This process begins in this chapter with a focus on evolving design and continues in with three following chapters with a greater focus on the learner response to challenges of game making in the recorded sessions.

### Using 3 Foci approach to frame data analysis

<!-- Draw on this document to give an overview of the framework and approach.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FIPn2dEB2aCKZi5z05j69cnHgpGNXFh1_SPV6h5l12g/edit#
Thus setting out a path for the following chapters. -->

Rogoff's [-@rogoff_observing_1995-1] describes three planes of personal, social and community activity which she advocates as foci for analysis. The model problematises the dichotomy of learner led, teacher led approaches [@mascolo_beyond_2009] in a way which suits the space between formal and informal learning that this community based model of game making occupies.

While the author's original research was on indigenous cultural practices on a village level, the model has been applied in both formal and informal educational settings; including FIND THREE EXAMPLES -

In this research I am interested in the way that facilitators can help nurture community practices and also in the way that participants have co-created the learning design created in this research and how participant practices have evolved.

In this section I outline Rogoff's initial conceptions of activities happening in three planes and related them to emergent activities in the game making community of this research. _I will also bring in critical counterpoints from relevant theory and compare to other "authentic"  teaching frameworks including PBL as a way to widening this analysis._

### Cultural Elements of the Design

These sections could follow a pattern of
 - rogoff's description / examples
 - my model examples
 - other links to PBL frameworks and/or educational concepts and contrast analysis

In the 3 foci model Rogoff refers to apprenticeship as a way of illustrating the process of being inculcated into community practices existing in a cultural plane. AN EXAMPLE ..

The game making community is not authentic or mature in the practices they are undertaking, the kind of community practices which we can undertake are focused partly on building connections to existing knowledge and practice. One of my roles as designer here was to uncover and to help participants explore knowledge that they were unaware they possessed.

At this stage of writing I include a bullet point list of relevant features to be expanded later.

- Shared repositories of resources - users shared a log in so they could see the work created by others. - Showcase: At the end of the game making process students asked strangers to play their game in the foyer of my departmental building
- Drama Games: the process of warming up, creates community and sets a tone
- Drama Process: specifically designed ot overcome limits of the classroom.
- Playtesting: the process of playtesting, either self or peer links back to a community purpose
- Shared repositories of resources - users shared a log in so they could see the work created by others.

DON'T PEAK TOO SOON AS THESE MAY BE EXPLORED IN SEPARATE CHAPTERS
PBL theory also highlights the value of linking learning to authentic environments

### Interpersonal Elements of the Design - Guided Participation

Interactions in the interpersonal plane in this model are described as guided participation. Guided participation in not a prescriptive  pedogogy or set of activities, rather it refers to any activities and interactions between learning community members which contribute towards shared endeavours.

The term expounds a view of learning as happening between the poles of direct instruction and free exploration. A 

The core activity of my participants was implementation of chosen game design patterns.

In starting experiments we saw that the long time in building the relevant knowledge to identify, agree on and implement game patterns negatively impacted motivation.

In order to accelerate the process of making a game to fit into contextual expectations of an acceptable project timeframe, I pre-chose the genre of game to be made and pre-prepared a set of coded example and tutorials to implement a range of game design patterns.

In PBL, UDL and other models - learner choice and building agency is shown to be of value in increasing engagement and ownership over learning.  

### Personal Dimension of the Learning - Personal Appropriation

In line with sociocultural approaches Rogoff points out the limits of an understanding of knowledge which promotes a view of knowledge as transmission from teacher to learner and is thus an individual process. Instead this exploration of knowledge and practices is framed as a mutual process.

While, this is potentially problematic in classroom environments, the mutuality of the process is evident in my responses to tensions via changes in design and spontaneous practices and understandings of knowledge required to make games enacted by participants.  

One significant tension I felt in evolving design was a nagging feeling that learning happening should be documented, or linked to some kind of curriculum. There are elements of the design which suit development of coding concepts and Computational Thinking.
However, I felt reluctance to explicitly teach these links via direct transmission.
