## Literature Review Introduction

The aims of this literature review:

- Recap motivations for game making and terms needed to expore that later
  - CT in relation to Design Patterns - abstract / concrete elements
- outline existing game making pedagogies  & resources for learning coding
- focus in on cultural / social elements of particular promising pedagogies.  
- introduce concepts that may also inform conceptual framework / methodology
  - PERHAPS MOVE TO NEXT CHAPTER?


## Structuring the literature review

<!-- NOTE - Does this need to be explicitly via Sociocultural take -->

To help answer RQ1 and 2, this literature review explores pedagogies and resources used by practitioners and learners to support the process of learning

_Specifically in RQ1 terms  - what does authentic mean. A bit of what does agency mean which is followed in chapter three._

Identify types of barriers / obstacles and address pedagogies which address then?
Because of the community focus of the study, but the relevance of new curriculum the lit review spans different community perspectives / scopes.

- What is learner agency
  - definitions of agency and education
  - what is agency in this context?

- Coverage of wider pedagogical frameworks focused on participants to develop agency in an evolving community.

    - what is informal settings / learning?
    - communities of practice - legitimate peripheral participation boundaries and Barriers
    - community of learner and the methods to expose practice

    <!-- - Note lack of specifics of community-building approaches for game making - so next section will cast net wider for general principles first -->

- Examples informal community creation in practice and research & pedogogies with young people

    - Tinkering -Design-based & Tinkering / Exploratory - Bevan et al
    - Parents as brokers in tech use / learning - Roque et al, Barron, Correa
    - 5th dimension
    - Mantle of the Expert (and drama processes games)


- K12 context: types of barriers addressed focused around curriculum and assessment, end with analysis of what formal ed often fails to address
    - computational thinking vs coding practices: explain why CT not the focus, abstract / concrete aspsect.


- professional and enthusiast game making communities and informal setttings: better to address coding practices not
      -hci and affordance theory, technical barriers , solved by design
      - MDA
      - design patterns and gdp collections
      - game jam, playful approaches, drama games  

The study then seeks to reconsile some of the different elements above in the context of family / informal ed -

## Addressing and disambiguating definitions of agency in education


Agency and autonomy have disputed, often inter-related definitions or are often ill defined in studies [@huang_autonomy_2013; @matusov_mapping_2016].

See also feminist reconceptualisations of autonomy as agency[@abrams_autonomy_1998].


To effectively answer RQ2 and RQ1 the concept of agency needs disambiguating.  

Concepts of agency are explored in more depth in chapter three, however a brief definition of agency in relation to informal education and this study is useful to ground the findings of the literature review.

Concepts of facilitating the development of agency in education have diverse threads [@matusov_mapping_2016]. These include: instrumental agency with a focus on developing capacities; effortful agency which enhances motivation and commitment; and authorial agency which involves agentic changes to the learning environment.

Matusov and colleagues critique effortful agency in education as focusing only on achieving goals predefined by educational establishments. Thus this summary focuses deepening an analysis on instrumental and authorial agency in relation to other research on the subject.

Matusov and colleagues (USEFUL BUT COMPLEX) outline many forms of agency to educational concepts.  [@matusov_mapping_2016]

The concept of instrumental agency to aid learner control is also useful as a way to reduce friction in learning designs. This more limited conception of agency as a way of getting things done is an attractive concept in designing for learners by designing out obstacles.

### Instrumental and relational agency

Instrumental agency reflects a concept of agency as the ability to get things done. Conceptually these practical dimension involve removing aspects of negative liberty caused by technical barriers [@matusov_mapping_2016, p. 433].

In this sometimes technological view of educational environments teachers or facilitators can to increase agency by removing individual barriers to use. However, a more social view of instrumental agency also includes relational aspects where leaners are able to offer and request support [@edwards_steps_2005].


### Authorial and transformative agency

Other takes of socio cultural school of research focus less on the individual and more on broader conceptions of activity. Stetsenko places agency in a socio-cultural theory between conceptions of humans as chiefly individualistic or instead as helpless bodies in wider cultural phenomenon   
[@stetsenko_critical_2020; @matusov_mapping_2016].



Matusov proposes authorial agency [@matusov_mapping_2016] as the concept of agency most aligned with x

DEFINE

As well as the work on Lave and Wegner on community based conceptions of agency,
Matusov bases much of the definition of authorial agency on existing work on transformational agency.

Hopwood's [-@hopwood_agency_2022] exploration of agency also focuses primarily on transformational agency and relational agency.

Specifically, TAS, TADS

TAS from Stetsenko addresses grand ideas of agency directly.
However the authour also grounds these grand ideas in concrete explorations, including play [@stetsenko_serious_2015]


Similarly while TADS addresses lofty ideas of "quote" they can be played out in smaller situations.

In exploring their differences Hopwood x and y.

Transformative agency [@engestrom2006development; @haapasaari_emergence_2016; @sannino_formative_2016].

For the purposes of this study, I agree with the view that the nature of agency as situated in context. Thus we do not say learners have or lack agency, as it is not a learner property independent of context  [@nieminen_what_2022].
## Pedagogies from coding for learning community - K12 focused

There is a lot of similarity of game making pedagogies and that of digital making and broader study of media literacy. This section attempts to stay focused on game making where possible but widens domain if relevant to the questions of community approaches.

- UMC / Remixing  - Half-baked games
- Design approaches - designing for an audience
- Broader definition of CT, computational fluency / computational participation.
- Physical methods, feedback, from constructionism
- Design patterns in Agent sheets

### Definitions of Computational Thinking

The promotion of Computational Thinking (CT) has been a key factor in the development of the UK's computing curriculum. However, the claims of early advocates that CT skills could be applied widely in subjects beyond computing are now advanced more cautiously to avoid the danger of over-promising [@tedre_long_2016]. We can use the distinction between concrete and abstract to examine the differences between two popular interpretations of Computational Thinking (CT). The first is an influential take from Jeanette Wing. "The most important and high-level thought process in computational thinking is the abstraction process. Abstraction is used in defining patterns, generalizing from instances, and parameterization" [@wing2011research]. Many learning resources designed to support the computing curriculum present this principle as four key pillars of CT: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithmic thinking [@bbc_bitesize_introduction_nodate]. The essence here is to deal with concepts and principles as abstract and separate from the context of coding.

Another widely used definition of CT by Brennan and Resnick [-@brennan_new_2012] was developed in response to a thought experiment "How do we describe what Tim, Shannon, and Renita are learning as they participate as designers of interactive media with Scratch?". The researchers took a grounded / situated approach to mapping the potential learning dimensions of students designing and coding collaborative, creative computing projects. The resulting map they created includes computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives.

- _Computational concepts_ include sequences,
loops, parallelism, events, conditionals, operators, and data; thus representing the mechanics of coding structures.
- _Computational practices_ include debugging, iteration, reuse and remixing, and abstracting and taking a modular approach.
- _Computational perspectives_ such as expressing, questioning connecting were observed in the behaviour of learners completing their coding designs.

This interpretation of CT, based on observation of learners in action, is more accessible to teachers and learners as they can more easily recognise their own practice than in the more abstract interpretations of CT. To give a specific example, rather than decomposition, the applied framework outlines taking an iterative, incremental approach to problem solving and arranging code in modules.

This broader, process driven definition of CT has been used and adapted by many organisations seeking to support the new computing curriculum. As such, it may be familiar from websites, posters and other supporting material created by groups like Barefoot computing. Lye's extensive review of teaching Computational Thinking [@lye_review_2014] used Resnick and Brennan's definition as the basis for the review, which points to the widespread use of this more applied approach. The wider definition of CT here assumes an environment where learners are engaged in the collaborative coding of a computing project. The review above and the influential framework used by Computing at School [@csizmadia_computational_2015-1]  have included elements of this applied framework as well as other more abstract CT concepts.




### Exploring the territory between instruction-based tutorials and unguided approaches

The process of learning technical skills through trial and error is something that many self-driven learners are familiar with. The desire to complete a particular project and self-motivated access to the resources to achieve it is the stuff of computing mythology, recalling the kind of garage innovation that created Apple computer and early hacker computing culture [@fuller_garage_2015]. However, this is not an ideal pedagogy. Even with access to resources and critiques of pure discovery learning are also valid [@mayer_should_2004].

On the other end of the spectrum, tutorials are a common way of learning coding and exist in many forms and formats [@head_composing_2020; @kim_pedagogical_2017].

Code snippets are often interwoven with text explaining the function of the code constructions.

The variety of audience and motivations of writer can account for the variation in form. Researcher also point out the limits of online coding tutorials namely that: "few explain when and why a particular concept is useful in programming; and few provide guidance for common errors" [@kim_pedagogical_2017, p. 325].

Critique of instruction...






### Use Modify Create

The 'Use-Modify-Create' approach proposed by Lee and colleagues [-@lee_computational_2011] is particularly promising to counter issue of user anxiety and demotivation surrounding the difficulty of coding games. UMC evolved from research involving the use of game making and robotics to support computational thinking [@denner_computer_2012; @denner_using_2014; @werner_pair_2013; @werner_children_2014]. The model advocates the remixing of existing games to act as a scaffold to build the competence of the beginner coder. Learners are guided to progress in the complexity of their modifications, thus becoming increasing proficient in the recognition and use of computational concepts and structures [-@lee_computational_2011]

**Use:** In the _Use_ stage, coders build a familiarity with coding interfaces, code structures and syntax through scaffolded approaches which involve interacting with the program code and what it produces.

**Modify:** In the _Modify_ stage learners progress to working on real projects created by others. Learners deepen their knowledge of coding structures and practices by altering existing projects and templates to suit their own aims.

**Create:** After novice coders become more familiar with patterns of code design in use in the modify stage, they can progress to replicate such patterns in other code that they create from scratch.

A study involving five hundred 9 to 14 year-olds found that the UMC approach can balance a structured approach with more student-led exploration [@franklin_analysis_2020]. The researchers also found that the students enjoyed the UMC approach as they had more choice and agency in the process. This is supported by other research which compared UMC with a starting-from-scratch approach and found higher student engagement for those in the UMC group [@lytle_use_2019]. The researchers found that because students using UMC had more time to play around with code, they were able to add their own personal touches and that this ownership over the code sustained their continued engagement. While the scope of the study is limited, observations support motivation of UMC that this pattern of creation maintains higher level of engagement through reducing technical barriers to participation, and affording greater sense of learner's ownership over end project through greater choice over the final outcome.

**Research on UMC which develops learner choice**

<!-- NOTE - This may be moved to design chapter -->

UMC has been developed to be end with scaffolded set of choices.
In a study where students use a block based language to develop simulations - the authors note limits of study but are enthusiastic about providing a limited set of choices for final exploration within a limited time frame [@lytle_use_2019-1; @lytle_use_2019]

- Scaffold Students and Teachers- Providing the necessary programming blocks students need to complete a choice
- Differentiate Choices by Difficulty - create choice systems that have varying difficulty
- Create Choices that Show Visible and Immediate Changes
- Make things Complex, not Complicated
- Draw from Student Desires - students will engage more with the material, feeling like the creations are their own.




<!--
  - Scaffold Students and Teachers- Providing the necessary pro-gramming blocks students need to complete a choice ala a Par-son’s Problem greatly reduces cognitive load, especially in activitieswhere lots of choices means lots of blocks. Similarly, giving teachers a “Cheat Sheet" of answers for each choice, scaffolds their abilityto act as a facilitator and debugger.

  Differentiate Choices by Difficulty- This time, challenge came from adding morec hoices, but each choice was relatively the samedifficulty. In the future, we wish to create choice systems that havevarying difficulty to give targeted tasks for each student skill level.

- Create Choices that Show Visible Change
  - Prioritize choicesthat produce immediate changes in the run of the simulation (e.g. anew animal appearing in the environment).Create Choices that Promote Content Inquiry- Our decisionto primarily focus on adding more animals came from the fact thateach new animal made the Food Web more complex.

  - Make things Complex, not Complicated- As demonstrated in Figure 2, each animal had relatively the same set of code blocks. In this way, a lot of choices were available without adding many additional necessary blocks for students.

- Draw from Student Desires- Some of the choice ideas (e.g. bear)came from responses from students in the ‘Fox-Only’ -->



### Microworlds and constructionist design principles
<!-- (generated by chat gpt) -->

Papert's concept of microworlds refers to simplified computer simulations or models that provide a controlled environment in which students can explore and experiment with maths or physics concepts in a concrete  way [@harel_constructionism:_1991; @papert_mindstorms:_1980; @papert_childrens_1993].

Papert believed that microworlds were an effective tool for promoting computational thinking. His take on CT however, should be contrasted to a abstracted later take from Wing [@lodi_computational_2021]. Instead here CT concepts are heuristics developed from concrete experience.  
This concept of CT as a set of heuristics or design behaviours continues in practitioner-focused interpretations of CT.

MOVE TO LR
There is  research on computing projects in the work of Papert [-@papert_mindstorms_1980] on Mircoworlds and subsequent research on programming tools in the constructionist tradition  [@kafai_constructionism_1996-1; @kafai_mindstorms_2014].




Papert argued that microworlds could help students develop computational thinking skills by providing them with opportunities to experiment with computational processes and to reflect on their own thinking. In addition to the software based tool of the microworld, the social context is key to the whole process.

While, examples of a Microworlds are diverse [@rieber_microworlds_2004], a Turtle drawing world using  LOGO can be used here as an example. In the Mathland of the turtle which speaks only LOGO, children are drawn to speak LOGO to progress. The affordances of the physical turtle provide visible motivation.


He argued that by working with microworlds, students could engage in hands-on and minds-on learning, which would help them to develop a deeper and more meaningful understanding of the concepts they were studying.

The work of Papert and the concept of microworlds continue to be influential in the field of educational technology [@kafai_constructionism_1996-1].

Today, microworlds are used in a variety of educational settings, from primary schools, afterschool clubs and universities. However, the use of microworlds in traditional school settings is not unproblematic [@papert_turtles_2002]. There is a danger that the potential is 'trivialised'[@hoyles_microworldsschoolworlds_1993] into a vehicle for instruction based processes aimed narrowed to teacher chosen curricular concepts.  

**Constructionist design principles**

The development of Logo as a programming language moved towards the use of block coding under the stewardship of MIT labs.

Resnick's work on constructionist design principles via software and tinkering tools merits summary here. CF - introduction.

### Half-baked games as Microworlds

The concept of 'half-baked' games, which are incomplete or somehow deficient in a way which motivates learners to delve into the code and improve them offers a possible enchancement to the 'Use-Modify-Create' model []

This concept of builds on Papert's concept of micro world used a framework for making and coding.

The focus of half-baked games is to design them in a way which encourages malleability of the code in directions that the learner may find interesting [@kynigos_half-baked_2007; @kynigos_children_2018]. Thus the original game designer makes complex decisions which highlight certain affordances of the game in a way which encourages the exploration of key concepts, in this case computational thinking.

Kynigos and Yiannoutsou identify a progression in the type of CT skills being used as the processing of modifying the game progresses as part of the Use-Modify-Create model moving from elements like pattern recognition associated with reading of code to ones like a creating abstracted structures and sequencing their own algorithms. Kynigos also highlights the possibilities of half-baked artefacts to build learner dialogue around the problems at hand as as 'a communicational tool to shape a common language within the community' 2007, p. 336).



### PRIMM

FIND MATERIAL IN OTHER BOOK CHAPTERS

**PRIMM:** PRIMM stands for Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify and Make. This model helps learners adopt coding practices and computational concepts through providing a concrete code example that they run after predicting what it does. Learners make changes to the existing code before finally creating code from scratch. PRIMM's starting point is students predicting existing code results. Asking students to identify target computing concepts in code examples allows teachers to guide students towards key computational thinking process or algorithmic details. Thus, PRIMM is well suited to the classroom as starting with prediction of a code allows a whole class of learners to unpack and repack the same set of concepts in a restricted time scale. This process that supports formal problem solving, paper-based questions of the GCSE exams. The use of code examples and a structured set of varied activities aligns well to UDL principle of representing knowledge in a variety of means. For a more detailed summary of the PRIMM approach the Quick Read pedagogy article.[^5]


Primm based on UMC but developed to highlight abstract concepts and processes via a predict stage.

### Semantic Profiles and Waves

Semantic profiles chart the use of more concrete (high semantic gravity) language and more abstract (high semantic density) concepts and patterns as they emerge in classroom situations [@macnaught_jointly_2013]. Exploring semantic profiles is being promoted by NCCE  an aid to teachers wanting to plan their lessons in a way that communicates the key abstract curriculum knowledge that students will need for exams, and to also allow them to put the concepts into practice to build real coding skills and to make valuable connections to personal experience. A Quick Read on semantic profiles is available on the NCCE website.[^2]

Research carried out by Curzon and colleagues [-@curzon_using_2020] in a computing education context outlines the value of semantic profiles in wave shape as opposed to a flatline which remains too much in concrete examples or more abstract concepts. This research highlights the value of unpacking, exploring and then repacking ideas during the course of a lesson. A student's understanding of a concept may deepen a little bit each time it is applied in practice and then reconnected with the abstract.

<!-- start with activities that allow the use of more concrete (high semantic gravity) language and then explore more abstract (high semantic density) concepts and patterns as they emerge in these authentic situations. -->

![semantic waves]({{ site.baseurl }}/Pictures/semantic_waves.png)


Figure 3.1 A Semantic Profile with Semantic Waves

Examples showing semantic wave profiles usually start with the process beginning with the abstract or with high semantic density. See Figure 1.1 for an example. The advice of starting with more abstract terminology and concepts may seem to be in opposition to the approach of Concreteness Fading as explained with the CRA method outlined above. However, on examination of the research example carried out in the research above, the process of starting with concepts may only involve giving a short outline of the concept that is being explored and saying that this will be illustrated in a following concrete activity.


### Pair programming & social/collaborative coding

**Pair Programming:**  Pair Programming groups students in pairs and divide coding two into two roles. One student undertakes hands-on coding while the other is free to think about more the abstract design of the overall program. A benefit of pair programming is to increase coding confidence as students build their experience of the different roles involved in coding. To help novice coders teachers should model and break down the processes involved. Pair programming involves social learning elements and can model a greater choices for students in they way they solve problems. The process of building an identity in a community with the help of peers is key to a socio-cultural understanding of how learners pick up coding in a classroom (or other settings). The importance of a coding community is explored in another chapter in this collection on design and project approaches. A summary of pair programming roles and tips on how teachers can help learners to adopt them in present in a Quick Read document from NCCE.[^6]

### Project based learning PBL

NOTE - This spans k12 and more informal / community environments - thus I'm not sure where to place it at the moment - Lit review needs reworking.

Project-approaches are widely advocated by Papert via constructionism school and taken up by MIT researchers and programmes, especially the outreach work of Mitchell Resnick surrounding Scratch and other creative computing project.

PBL also aligns with a much broader progressive approach to education. The broad benefits can be summarised as such;

- Student choice

**Cautionary note**
While the above claims are widely supported, the wide nature of the definition complicates any broad claims of replicability.


#### Game making and Project / Problem Based Learning

Game making can be seen as an example of the kind of wicked problem favoured in project-oriented problem based learning (referred to from now on as PBL) (Mateas and Stern, 2005). PBL has a variety of forms, an exploration of which is beyond the scope of this study (Aditomo et al., 2013). The most pertinent areas of PBL of to this study are the over-arching focus on authentic learning environments and the process of building learner autonomy within a structured and supportive approach [@hernandez_aalborg_2015]

When learners undertake real life projects with relevance for, or with a direct link to, environments outside of the learning space, there are strong parallels to the models of peripheral participation in communities of practice (Wenger, 1998).  A PBL game making process would do well to foster participation by highlighting playful paths into community participation to maximise group identification and sustainability (Thorsted et al., 2015). Fictional tasks and roles can also impact learner engagement (Heathcote and Herbert, 1985).

The structuring of the learning involved in PBL is highlighted by those wishing to defend it from dismissal as unsupported, pure discovery learning (Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007; Kirschner et al., 2006). We can see parallels in PBL programme design to that tinkering tools and environments in that decisions are made to support specific areas of learner discovery deemed of particular value by carefully obscuring other potentially distracting aspects behind ‘black box’ processes (Resnick and Silverman, 2005).
OTHER HEURISTICS OF CONSTRUCTIONISM

I propose that there guidance and tactics in area of discovery based learning to help balance between learner choice and engaging, open experimentation verses steering towards useful shared concepts is often under explored in research leaving a documentation gap that .   

Why does this gap exist? Partly due to the compressed form of academic papers, partly due to the privileging of abstract analysis over more domain specific observations on practice.


#### PBL and Authenticity in the domain of teaching programming

The goal of authenticity of expression, assessment and the motivation of a real audience aligns PBL with the kind of learning that happens when people take part in work-place or other authentic activities.

There are overlapping dimensions and spectrum of authenticity in learning environments including; hands-on experimentation (as opposed to text-book sources); proximity to workplace practices and professional tools; personal relevance to learners.

While PBL has the potential to address all of these factors there is some ambiguity in much of the literature on PBL. EXAPAND WITH CRITICALITY. There is a lack of clear advice on how to ensure authenticity

In the domain of computer programming,

The next section deals with pedagogical approaches that are rooted in professional or non-educational settings.  


## Pedagogical resources in the form of professional practices and frameworks

These professional practices and framework are both informed by research and in common use in professional communities.

Where there is overlap between domains this is explored in each section.

### Design steps frameworks via stages

Many design frameworks exist in diverse areas of production with varied degrees of adoption. One stream in CS stems from engineering and design thinking [@mouza_imagining_2013; @resnick_all_2007; @winarno_steps_2020-1].

A typical framework from teach engineering website [@noauthor_engineering_nodate], takes the form of
Ask: Identify the Need & Constraints;
Research the Problem;
Imagine: Develop Possible Solutions;
Plan: Select a Promising Solution;
Create: Build a Prototype;
Test and Evaluate Prototype; and Improve: Redesign as Needed

This has been adapted by computing educators elements of are included in early literature to help adoption of new computing curriculum in UK [@csizmadia_computational_2015].

Michel Resnick, a researcher involved in the Scratch project at MIT illustrates an approach to design-based education through a creative cycle. The five circular stages are; Imagine, Create, Play, Share, Reflect and returning to Imagine once more. The model encourages both parents and teachers to create a supportive environment for creativity.

![creative spiral image]({{ site.baseurl }}/Pictures/Figure8.1.jpg)


Figure 8.1. Diagram of five circular stages; Imagine - Create - Play - Share - Reflect - Imagine  


There is less clarity about if and how the stages could be used by learners to scaffold their design process.   
(critique of this in terms of writing structures stages at primary )


#### Broad design based approaches

Resnick [-@resnick_scratched_2012] describes the foundations of the design-based approaches in education as; engaging in design activities, exploring personally meaningful topics, collaborating with others, and deepening understanding through reflection. The key reason to adopt these principles is to increase engagement via sustained participation in computing projects for a broad range of learners. One of the sources for sustained engagement is when, as part of the iterative process, learners are able to test and then revise their creation or experiment based on their own evaluation. Another factor is the importance of a community in the design process, as a real audience for creations, as a source of inspiration and as peer evaluators in the testing process.



### MDA and conceptual game elements framework

The MDA framework has been created from games research with an aim to help define

The Mechanics element of the framework has much in common with GDPs. The different is explored by researchers [@olsson2014conceptual].

The common element is the utility of the concepts to designers. Although the process of formalising such patterns and mechanics is also noted.
The levels of abstraction of

### Design Patterns and Game Design Patterns in professional context

NOTE - I think there is material to copy and paste here.

Design patterns are most commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing but they are also useful for all levels of learners. Design patterns are rooted in real-life incidences of problems that are often solved in a particular way. They are concrete examples of coding principles in context.

Design patterns are most commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing but they are also useful for all levels of learners. Design patterns are rooted in real-life incidences of problems that are often solved in a particular way. They are concrete examples of coding principles in context. Design patterns can help the development of coding communities if more experiences coders take the time to document the patterns they use in an accessible way for novice coders. For educators the use of design patterns can help support learners develop coding proficiency by providing scaffolding and modelling good design decisions. However, one of the challenges for teachers of using worked examples and design patterns is how to integrate them into student-led design challenges.



<!-- This mirrors work done to automatically analyse Scratch project to assess levels of Computational Thinking Hoover et al., 2016). Here by contrast, analysis is undertaken using framework of use of computer language syntax and data types rather than game mechanic concepts and other code pattern usage. -->


The concept of computational design patterns is well explored in the professional literature of computer programming and design [@gamma_design_1995], and has also been adopted by game designers [@bjork_patterns_2005]. Design patterns are well thought out solutions to common issues faced by computer programmers and system designers.

Research in this area points to challenges of teaching the abstract nature of traditionally shared design patterns related to object oriented coding languages but points to visual methods and games as promising tactics [@azimullah_evaluating_2020; @da_cruz_silva_fostering_2019]

The term game design patterns (GDP) is used in different ways. Kreimeier [@kreimeier_case_nodate] distinguishes content patterns from software engineering patterns. Software engineering patterns are used to structure code and keep it architecturally neat thus facilitating code sharing and extension. These patterns would be invisible to the end player of the game. Content patterns describe common patterns of game play and design that are visible to the player.

<!-- Indeed players may become very familiar with these GDPs as they build their literacy as players about what they like or dislike about game they play.  -->

Eriksson and colleagues [-@eriksson_using_2019] use the second interpretation rephrasing slightly as gameplay design patterns, thus placing emphasis on the exposure to the user via playing the game. They described the utility of games design patterns as a _lingua franca_ for game developers. Other benefits cited are GDP as a source of creative inspiration and as an aid to problem-solving.

Their research, which involved young people, builds on related research with adults with the explicit goal of learning game design. One product of this research is a list of GDP patterns as a public collection (available at http://virt10.itu.chalmers.se/) [@bjork_patterns_2005].



<!-- NOTE - RETURN TO THEIR EXTENSIVE LIST OF ERIKSSON - AND THE DESIGN CHOICE OF HOW BIG A LIST TO MAKE ESPECIALLY FOR NOVICE CODERS -->
<!-- From Eriksson article - explore in more depth in Lit Review..

Could move some of this to the results discussion -
"- Problem-Solving for Game Interaction Design: Patterns can contain various potential solutions for designers which have identified problems with specific interaction parts a game concept.
- Inspiration: Pattern collections embed gameplay concepts found useful in other games, and can therefore serve as a knowledge source for new game designs or redesigns of existing ones.
- Structured Design Tool: Both by enumerating concepts as individual patterns and by providing relations between patterns, a pattern collection can help designers to work through different levels of abstraction in a design in a structured fashion.
- Communication: The patterns offer the possibility to describe the design in a standardized format to make the understanding and comparison of different designs easier. This can be designers communicating with other designers but can also be participants discussing with other participants. The offering of a standardized format for concepts can potentially also increase the likelihood of members of heterogeneous groups being able to see each other as peers since they can communicate in a common way." -->


<!--
In my own game making model students picked missions from a choice of printed resources. There were four colour themed categories of missions. _Game mechanics_ are features to do with the actions of the game. _Game space_ patterns address the layout of the game. _Game polish_ patterns involve adding music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements. Finally _System and Challenge_ patterns look at how different elements interact to create challenge in the game. An example of a game mechanic design pattern follows. -->

### Using professional frameworks to help novice game makers

This section examines the use of potential use of these professional tools or processes in an educational context.

#### Using concepts of design patterns and game design patterns

Werner and Denner built an ambitious assessment elements into a two year programme using Alice to make games. They built a software tool to quantify the levels of computational thinking, using a structure of thinking algorithmically [@werner_fairy_2012].
The results - a limited use of standard CT concepts by students - led them to also investigate the use of students of game mechanics as well as more traditional CS constructions [@werner_children_2012]. They began to identify use of design patterns and then combination of those patterns into large game mechanics.

#### Using pattern collections and code examples to help students.

THERE IS DUPLICATION AT END - IN TENSIONS

To help revolve the play paradox - of learner choice vs subject exploration [@hoyles_pedagogy_1992] Franklin and friends suggest the use of the UMC framework [@franklin_analysis_2020].
Other work from UMC proponent Lytle suggests a list of extensions to choose from swapping create for choose [@lytle_use_2019-1]. Based partly on the cause of teacher stress caused by the open ended nature of the "Create" part of the model.   
Other researchers  used to scaffold creation of coding projects by novices [@wang_novices_2021] and note barriers students encoutered including, mapping barriers, other

## Informal Education Pedagogies

To develop these focused professional frameworks of concepts, we now place them in the context of wider theories of community and informal  learning.

Informal education has the potential to offer less barriers to authorial agency which are engendered by factors such as curricular constraints, practical classroom factors and school behaviour norms,


### Defining and conceptualising informal education

Definitions of informal education are complex and beyond the remit of this literature review. Informal here is not just about a school or non-school environment [@erstad_identity_2012].

Gerber define formal learning as that which happens in school and informal learning as that outside of school [@gerber_development_2001],
Sefton-Green [@sefton-green_literature_2004] complicates this view, noting that2 informal learning can take place in formal settings and vice-versa.

Others writers [@eshach_bridging_2007, p. 173; @werquin_recognition_2009]  describe learning happens outside of formal institution and where there is little instruction but the learner experience is carefully planned using the term 'non-formal' in contrast to both formal and unstructured/informal learning.

#### Conceptualising informal education via foundational theory

Foundation sociocultural approach which goes beyond a conception of transmission model of learning and embraces learning in context.

<!-- NOTE  - is it a good ideat to be using domain specific literature to support? -->

- Vygotsky (and friends) - foundational ideas - activity as unit of analysis - mediation via objects and ideas [@luriia1976cognitive]

- Wertsch and Cole - community and context as vital in studies, role of cultural mediation in development, role of objects to study human culture [@cole_beyond_1996-1; @cole_culture_1995] .

- Rogoff - community of learners and 3 foci as a way to frame this in education

<!--
// don't focus in on DBR save that... -->
<!-- NOTE - MOVE TO METHODOLOGY
### Activity as Unit of Analysis
Quickly rephrase from a Rogoff chapter. Keep it snappy. -->

The vital role of cultural mediation in development [@cole_beyond_1996-1]

This clearly aligns with community-based digital making and the use of objects as mediated objects and creative processes which facilitate and constituent participation.

### Communities of Practice

communities of practice - legitimate peripheral participation boundaries and Barriers

#### Informal, participatory, digital and gaming communities

Digital learning in IILP (GLAM settings) is fertile [@degner_digital_2022; @schwan_understanding_2014]

The focus on historical and cultural artefacts and practices brought by Rogoff, and in particular the concept of guided participation was originated in non-school settings and younger age ranges.  

However, the concept has been used to analyse participation in non-formal and formal settings.
The following studies are relevant:

- guided participation framed in media literacy @aarsand_appropriation_2016.


### Guided participation Rogoff and Communities of Learners

<!-- Perhaps don't get into 3 planes yet save that for more detailed analysis -->

(Continue to) refute or problematise  dichotomy of learner led, teacher led approaches [@mascolo_beyond_2009].

Participation on community activities as a valid approach.

Cultural and social factors are vital to development process even if hidden in as school setting.
Guided participation as a middle ground between instruction and discovery.

Teachers benefit from the concept of scaffolding, and designing learning environments and interventions to support learners to enter into a pattern of activity.

This has been applied in various forms, PBL, apprenticeship models, for example have guided participation as a base via different forms of scaffolding.



### Funds of Knowledge

My study will be guided by understandings of how home discourses or 'funds of knowledge' (Moje et al., 2004; Moll et al., 1992, p. 3) can be drawn on as a resource by participants to facilitate learning in new environments.

COPIED AND PASTED BUT USE AS BASE - IF NOT INCLUDED IN INTRO
The concept of Funds of Knowledge emerged from research within United States Latino communities. The term addresses the use of knowledge and skills from participation in activities outside school that teachers can build on to help classroom work and to support the motivation of learners. Researchers found that Latino home cultures, skills and traditions were hardly visible in mainstream school cultures. This resulted in a form of deficit thinking about the performance of these communities [@moll_funds_1992]. Research by the UK National Literacy Trust [-@picton_video_2020] of 11-16 year olds found that 96% percent of boys and 65.2% of girls play video games. This study shows that while there remains a disparity between genders, game playing is still very widespread and young people are unlikely to be part of a household where no games are played.

Game making allows children to draw on funds of knowledge in various ways, perhaps in the choice of the kind of game that is to be made, in the setting or subject matter or the style and aesthetics of audio and visual elements of the game. Teachers can also draw out attitudes and knowledge of game cultures and bring them into the learning environment in an inclusive way. In addition, knowledge of game design conventions can be used by teachers to exemplify coding concepts. For example, consider conditional coding constructs. If Pac-Man touches a ghost, then a player life is lost. Such structures are described as a game design patterns. Werner and colleagues [-@denner_using_2014] found that the use of design patterns and game mechanics when teaching novice coders can increase accessibility for learners due the concrete and relatable approach.

### Mantle of the Expert as a processes drama

A way of leveraging some of the processes outline above in a schooling context.

The salient features of MoE.
    Broadly speaking, Mantle of the Expert draws on three teaching modalities: inquiry learning; drama for learning (closely related to dramain-education, or, as it is sometimes called, process drama); and what we might call “expert framing” [@aitken_dorothy_2013].

Heathcote discusses authenticity in detail in her writings [@heathcote_dorothy_1984].
The focus on authenticity,  to align  needs interest and object interests - see notes - and the creative work of the facilitator to align them
In an illustrative case study on computing the needs interests are to respond to the percieved authentic need of a scenario, and the object interest was the subject matter of learning to the computer system to carry out a task.

Writing in role or writing in action is a technique used in MoE [@hinton_workplace-focused_nodate]

Rainer and Bolton explore some of the rigidity of the MoE approach in terms of time allocated and other factors. Rainer outlines a wider scope of a process drama [-@rainer_drama_2012].


**Other forms of process dramas and STEM education**

MoE is one form of  other process drama. Others exist. They share similar aims. MoE can be seen as formulaic [@rainer_drama_2012], or prohibitively time consuming [@heathcote_drama_1994].

Rainer chapter [@rainer_drama_2012] also highlights authenticity in different phases, both in activity and in assessment to aid metacognition.

Existing research shows value in STEM education to address barriers associated with identity issues [@fields_picking_2013; @gill_process_2012].

My own work with Manchester Met University drama education department explored the value of coding in role.  [@caldwell_drama_2019]

## Studies with pedagogies addressing barriers to do with identity and computer cultures

**Studies exploring identity and barriers to participation**

Game making is thus a suitable mediumn to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

Issues of identities and barriers have been explored in relation to gender in terms of game making in several studies.
REWRITE WITH CORRECT CITATIONS - ALSO INCLUDE THE GAME TESTERS OF BLACK STUDENTS.   

**Gender related identities**

The Girls Creating Games programme which asked similar questions concerning the impact of a Flash-based game programme on computer proficiency and desire to continue with computer studies Denner, 2007). Findings were again mixed but encouraging in some areas. While there was no increase in desire to persue computing, there were marked increases in computer related confidence, ability and a decrease in gender stereo typing around computer use.

The issues of gender stereo-typing and identity in relation to computers were explored by Pelletier as part of the Making Games project using the Mission Maker software 2008).

<!-- Data was recorded from two UK schools in an 18 month after school programme. Pelletier draws on the work of Butler 1988) to caution against overdue influence of a set conception of gender or cultural stereotypes, seeing gender as a personal and flexible product of continuing activities and interactions. In this study, she explored the promise of the process of game design and the analysis of gaming habits as a platform and set of tools for young participants to explore and construct their gender identity over time. This area is a rich seam to explore and a more recent study by Fisher and Jenson critically explored diverse themes through a summer game making programme 2017). Emerging issues included pinkification, marginalisation and exclusions of women from game cultures, sexualisation and harassment. -->

Kafai and Burke also address the issues of gender identities and game design 2014). They propose that we ask not *How can we bring girls into the game making clubhouse* but rather *How can we build new clubhouses suitable for the interests of girls*. Two of the playful elements they suggest are textiles related technology and the promotion of more collaborative online spaces as opposed to technology competitions.


- girl's low self-confidence in the area of computing compared to their ability [@beyer_gender_2003; @margolis_unlocking_2002]

**Research**
Extensive research by Roberson on game making in schools measured gender differences in performance and attitudes to game making and computing in pre post tests [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_influence_2013].  

The findings were mixed as while girls outperformed boys in use of computational structures, neither gender ended the programme with a greater desire to learn more about computers in the future.

The Girls Creating Games programme which asked similar questions concerning the impact of a Flash-based game programme on computer proficiency and desire to continue with computer studies [@denner_girls_2007] . Findings were again mixed but encouraging in some areas. While there was no increase in desire to persue computing, there were marked increases in computer related confidence, ability and a decrease in gender stereo typing around computer use.

**Race related identities**

In study by Thayter and Ko [@thayer_barriers_2017] the work of Margolis et al is analysed using concepts from communities of practice, type of barriers, and personal obstacles [@margolis_stuck_2008;]

    Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race and Computing by Margolis, Estrella, et al. [ 12] examined the racial gap in high school CS, finding barriers that included lack of access to classes (formal boundary), cultural expectations on who the classes were for, feelings of isolation in classes, divisions within classes between those who “have it or don’t have it” (informal boundaries), and lack of social support(personal obstacle). Additional studies found participation and success in computing programs depended on background experience [ 2, 27 ], comfort level [ 27 ], sense of belonging and stereotypes (dis proportionately negatively affecting women) [ 2 , 5, 10, 16 ], view of self as an “insider” [21], and believed role of luck [27]

I adopt a similar approach but use the language of AT contradictions, barriers and tensions.

### Mozilla, Webmaking and code playgrounds

#### Webmaking

A Mozilla white paper [@mozilla_foundation_webmaker_2014] outlines the power of exploring web technology as an empowering activity. My own work in this area has been informed by work developing teaching materials for the Mozilla Foundation as part of the Teach the Web programme.

 <!-- This programme introduced a broad set of competencies name Web Literacies including; digital literacy
- web literacy - narrower
- webmaker - and more specific affordances of key web based coding and exploring tools -->

Javascript is an authentic language, core to modern web pages and applications.  

I contributed to the Mozilla teach the web programme by writing a course called Quacking Javascript. My report on the underlying pedagogical approach outlines the following possibilities; playful approach, use of online games, use of popular culture references to increase engagement [@chesterman_webmaking_2015].  

#### Code playgrounds

Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals. In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity and thus an ability . My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics.

MOVE TO LR.
The process of running web code can be complicated by setting up a server environment locally to test and then finding a live webserver and the complexity of transferring files to the server via FTP/SSH processes. . Code playground allow users to circumvent such problems. While originally designed more for problem solving, a service more recent code playgrounds provide is to act as a more permanent host for web projects.  

In their brand style and selected  picks of projects, many code playgrounds celebrate and encourage a playful spirit of creativity and sharing.

<!-- NOTE  - I loved FTP and feel nostalgic? perhaps rfer back to that in conclusion? -->

<!-- DROPPED -  There are strong parallels in this presentation to that Scratch community and to the sharing ethos integral to the maker-movement (explored in Lit Review). The interplay between play and work via shared experimentation is developed further in a later discussion chapter. -->

#### Other online asset creation tools

There are other ways to create assets online. Piskel is a pixel graphics editor, audio creation of assets. These tools are provided by a mix of enthusiast coders and communites of game makers. ### Mozilla, Webmaking and code playgrounds

#### Phaser.js

While the Webmaker program was discontinued and the end of a funding cycle, ongoing core work of Mozilla to provide resources for webdevelopers. One strand of this is game development using javascript  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games

Mozilla chose phaser as a javascript library/ framework (see Glossary). Phaser is a javascript framework embedded in html page. Unlike many game making tools this tools set can be extended to other kinds of projects and is a professional and foundational toolset used to build the majority of websites and many phone applications.

#### Summary of authenticity- COMMENT OR MOVE

Javascript as coding language, Phaser as a game making framework and Glitch as a code environment, are highly authentic and used by both professional coders and enthusiasts alike.

### Game jams & game competitions

Hackathons, Game Jams and accelerated production methods

Hackathon events are characterise by a time constrained and thus accelerated production ethos. They have widened beyond code   to embrace other creative and educational domains  [@johnson_civic_2014; @kienzler_learning_2017]


The value of rapid prototyping has been popularised by Agile design techniques as a way to avoid wasted planning time. The theory being to create a minimal proof of concept and test with users.

Accelerated production methods are being applied to a wide variety of domains. Game jams draw on rapid prototyping processes, and from  hackathons they add constraints to accelerate creativity [@arya_international_2013; @gabler2005prototype].

Game Jams are an a type of hackathon where participants create games individually or in teams in a time-constrained period, typically 24 or 48 hours. Team events often take place in physical venues which may be part of a wider global Jams [@arya_international_2013]. Within Game Jams a breadth of materials are used including video games, interactive fiction, and even a Cardboard Jam [@eberhardt_no_2016].

Eberhardt also identifies potentially incompatible strands of Game Jams, specifically citing commercialised events and professional Game Jammers contrasted to those Jams with a social purpose with a more diverse, less target driven audience [@eberhardt_no_2016, p. 3].

Goddard et al have analysed the key aspects of Game Games including tools, organisational processes and rewards systems [-@goddard_playful_2014], using a playful vs. gameful spectrum from Caillois [-@caillois_man_2001]. Relevant design factors include; allowing teams to register before the event or enforcing a more playful team creation process, varied award categories which encourage diverse outcomes rather than technically structured awards and the culture of the Jam which may encourage risk taking and experimental process over commercially viable products.

Beyond the scope of more competitive Game Jams a collective of New York educators have collaborated to create a process aimed at young people that can be applied in a shorter time-frame [@games_for_change_get_2017]. Their process, the Moveable Game Jam, emphasises low-cost and both digital and analogue offline game production. The motivation is to communicate fundamentals concepts of game design process to participants.

<!-- These are broken down into; space, goal,components, mechanics and rules.  -->
<!-- The educational motivation is design and systems thinking for young people aligned with the Framework for 21st Century Learning (Gilbert,2016). -->

The Moveable Game Jam can be situated on the playful side of the spectrum in that it uses loosely structured activities and broad goals allowing for significant learner agency. Conversely, there are element of a more structured approaches in the steering of game outputs towards particular social goals, periodic facilitator checking of the fundamental concepts previously mentioned and the use of extensive playtesting in the process.

Play testing is the process of involving other participants to try out a prototype of a game early the creation process [@eladhari_design_2012]. It has a particular value in forcing an iterative approach.

## Discussion





#### Inequality of access to participatory culture communities (Barrier)

In these more naturalistic settings, Ito and colleagues note that generative activities are the exception rather than norm even in expressly creative communities [-@ito_hanging_2010]. Productive partnerships in communities like Scratch are extremely rare compared to false starts. Studies of the New Grounds site which has a similar aim of creating media collaborations, via collabs, showed a 80 percent failure rate of collaborative projects [@luther_why_2010].

On the other end of the spectrum is the desire to bring open-ended practices into the school setting. We see that a similar pattern in different communities -- ABOVE IN MAKING - SCRATCH IN SCHOOLS While the focus of my study will be on family learning, due to the need for strategies to bring game making into schools settings, which I will address this issue. Kafai's study detailing an emergent peer pedagogy, accepts some of the limits of the school setting but identifies peer practices that show great promise.



**Building learner identities to address Inequalities**

One significant element of in this process is learner perception of their own limits.

### Barrier - lack of knowledge of cultural processes

**Roles and practices to support learners**

The tension between autonomous participation in a naturalistic on structured facilitated support is one that is also explored in the extensive literature exploring project based approaches. Here advocates of this approach promote the value of open-ended, authentic projects while critics highlight that without support that collaboration is difficult between learners and thus needs to be scaffolded with structured activities and taught input
[@kirschner_why_2006; @kollar_collaboration_2006]

I mention this as the literature surrounding the mature field of Project Based Learning may be a good source of inspiration for tactics to address issues of scaling

Roque makes a convincing case for the unpicking of the supportive and collaborative roles of parents and facilitators to build this capacity and awareness of family learning roles. However, while the design of the FCL programme was effective to build parental confidence and increase overall accessibility, it left questions about the effectiveness of the process to enable learning at home.

We can compare the difficulties of scaling of this hybrid setting (FCL) with more structured, and more naturalistic learning environments. It can be tempting to see the process of hanging out line in the frame of Ito's online and social participation in informal communities as infinitely replicable. Such online communities are out there. It is up to learner to navigate and extract learning and skills as they see fit.


### Tensions surrounding authenticity of tool use- move to LIT REVIEW / END DISCUSSION?

Rainer, Bolton and other practitioner-researchers agree on the potential and value of exploring other subject matter - e.g.  literacy, maths, science and history -  and undertaking authentic project work within a drama frame [-@rainer_drama_2012].

This authenticity has several relevant dimensions in this study including: audience; toolset; and supportive processes / documentation. This section explores the these dimensions of authenticity and the resulting relationships with agency of the learners.

PBL is adapted to schools in many settings thus, authenticity is "on a scale" in PBL  The concept of an authentic-as-possible project is a key tool for educators to support game making via project based learning [find support]. One advatange of working with digital tools is that if issues of complexity and cost can be addressed access to laptops and the internet allow learners to use very similar production tools to professionals.


**Key message: authentic tools and processes can increase agency but facilitators should use them with careful curation - as there are negative effects too**


<!-- - audience
- tools
- processes (professional and peers ?)
- shared concepts - link to GDPs as a big one -->
  <!-- An unusual approach so why?
  - involvement with mozilla / teach the web
  - authenticity - link between developer community and education, global in scope
  - can use a cut and paste, remix, irreverant approach - link to media activist / hacktivist pirate cultures.

Research on project based learning using technology supports the motivational and inspirational factors of authentic tools in the fields of STEM computing [@garneli_computing_2015-1; @humble_use_nodate], media making and STEM in general. [IF SO FIND THIS ]

<!-- The inspirational factor of _lifting the lid_ was reflected in a conversation among participants communicating a sense of awe of how much code must be involved in a professional game based on the relative complexity of the code of their simple game. -->
