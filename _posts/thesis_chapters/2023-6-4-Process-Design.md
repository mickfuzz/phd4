## Chapter Introduction  

This chapter charts the evolution of the learning design. It draws on immediate analysis of participants reactions and contributions from journal notes, participant interviews and analysis of changes in the learning resources created.

The first section is a short summary of the phases of the design.


<!-- The design description is framed within DBR language and concepts. -->
<!-- Section describing  Game Design Patterns as  the main unit of Activity. See Blunden to frame this and to describe the utility of the idea  [@blundenInterdisciplinaryConceptActivity2009; @blundenGermCellUnit2014]. -->

### Contextual factors from practitioner perspective influencing design


**Recap of context and specifics of designing for informal learning**

- design based experiments - some factors
- informal learning - recap rogoff and similar - issues of designing for informal settings

<!-- As per Rogoff's analysis of informal learning in museaums [], the process of finding a medium between structured activity and authentic activity can be challenging.

The kinds of exhibits which invite extended play are of interest to this study. Such design indicates that there are affordances that invite revised design, tinkering and ongoing play.
-->

**Cultural influences on my choice of learning design**

I set up the working pattern based on my professional experiences and my own academic and cultural interests. As mentioned in the introduction, DIY culture, remix culture, repair culture, TAZ events are strong influences to the learning design based on the ideals of an autonomous community.

 - a desire to increase engagement based on my experiences in classroom and out of classroom - Home Ed / coder dojo experiences
 - the link to cultural practices of code patching and remixing - the example of the plumber coder potentially being someone who finishes the job rather than elegant coder.
 - other experiences of social coding being important being part of a community working on a joint project (add a quote from Dave?)
 <!-- - A walled garden approach in terms of the GDP and code documentation and examples that are used. Based on my own experience of developer documentation and varied coding approaches. -->
- Other examples from the interviews with practitioners are relevant to include here.

**Practical factors**

It is important to address contextual factors that facilitated and shaped development of some initial creative practices. Including:

- Impact of research practicalities
- The location at the university
- Eliza effect of being part of a research project

<!-- Eliza effect? If so how relevant? -->

Availability of resources potentially novel. For example, the ability to have that number of identical computers for this audience in particular, and using this shape of working which was determined by technical reasons but which had an impact nevertheless on the ability for students to move around the room and the absence of a front for the teacher to teach from. After attempts in previous sessions I abandoned attempts to use the screen in the space to do explicit teaching. The process was very disruptive to the emerging group behaviours and practices.

**Key questions / motivations in creating a new learning community**

The game making community is not authentic or mature in the practices they are undertaking, the kind of community practices which we can undertake are focused partly on building connections to existing knowledge and practice. One of my roles as designer here was to uncover and to help participants explore knowledge that they were unaware they possessed.



<!-- These sections could follow a pattern of
 - rogoff's description / examples - but likely include a larger breakdown of 3 foci in Methodology Chapter.
 - my model examples
 - other links to PBL frameworks and/or educational concepts and contrast analysis

In the 3 foci model Rogoff refers to apprenticeship as a way of illustrating the process of being inculcated into community practices existing in a cultural plane. AN EXAMPLE .. -->


<!-- At this stage of writing I include a bullet point list of design relevant features to be expanded later.

- Shared repositories of resources - users shared a log in so they could see the work created by others.
- Showcase: At the end of the game making process students asked strangers to play their game in the foyer of my departmental building
- Drama Games: the process of warming up, creates community and sets a tone
- Drama Process: specifically designed ot overcome limits of the classroom.
- Playtesting: the process of playtesting, either self or peer links back to a community purpose
 -->





## Short vignette illustrating shifts in scope of activity

The following vignette, consisting of extracts of participant activity over 20 mins of a session, is presented as an summary of different scopes of activity. The participant is the child Toby who in this session has been working independently.

<!-- __Insert image of code__

While the code is made up of various elements, only the javascript file is normally altered by participants.
The complexity is hidden away from the end user.

### Commentary on Vignette - including a brief description of the nested levels of activity & tools used

<!-- REWRITE THE BELOW - CHANGE FOCUS TO TOOLS /RESOURCES -->

Activity Theory allows researchers to identify intersecting or nested systems of activity with varied goals. Taking a holistic view of goals of the game making activity, we can identify the larger and smaller scale objectives of systems of varied scale.

These include:

- Larger-scoped objective: creating a game which is fun to play and communicate an environmental theme
- Mid-level objectives: identifying and implementing key game features to add to the game
- Lower-level objectives: creating, changing and transporting game assets or changing code constructs to enact or change game elements

A short description of the activity systems follows will illustrative diagrams / table followed by an illustrative commentary which makes references to the vignette above.   

<br />
<br />

| **Subject**         | **Objective**             | **Tools & Processes**          |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Community of novice game makers | Creating a game which is fun to play and communicates an environmental theme     | Shared log in to code playground (glitch.com)   |
|   |      | Shared log in to graphic editor (Piskel)    |
|   |      | Instructions from facilitator including the overall mission   |
|   |      | Starting game template    |
|   |      | Group playtesting     |
|        |     |

Table 4.x.  Tools used in larger-scoped objective involving the wider community of notice coders collectively making separate games.

<br />
<br />

In this larger scoped activity system the direct objective of the activity is to make a game which is fun for the intended audience to play and which explores an environmental theme. While this is the chief objectives other high level objectives are present but much less dominant in this setting. Other objectives include: research goals on the part of the researcher/ participant; desire to create a useful learning experience on the part of student helpers; learning computing skills and concepts as a home education project; and participating with other home educators in a creative environment and thus building team and communication skills. While the primary audience for the created games are peers via ongoing informal testing, the theoretical end users are students and staff in the Manchester Met Brooks building where their games will be shared in arcade cabinets.

INCLUDE PICTURE OF CABINET BEING PLAYED? - perhaps with branding

In the vignette of Toby's activity this wider objective is present in the facilitator orientation at the start which references this audience -  _the Monday after we can play our games and we can share them with students. We can make the students frustrated when they can’t beat our games_. At the end of the vignette text, one of the student helpers also imagines this audience playing the game of Toby.   

Toby begins the game making session playing his own game which he has developed from a shared starting template. During the session he invites many other group members to play his game. He initiates and responds to may conversations around the difficultly of the game he has designed.

 Analysis TO COME.


| Subject         | Objective             | Tools & Processes          |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Groups or individual participants | Implementing game elements   | Code editing tool (glitch)   |
|   |   |  Game preview tool (glitch) |
|   |   |  Menu of game patterns at ggc-examples.glitch.me  |
|   |   |  Step by step tutorials on FLOSS manuals  |
|   |   |  Playtesting own game |
|        |     |

Table 4.x.  Tools used in mid-level objectives when selecting and planning implementation of game elements.

<!-- One observation from he experimental course was that without significant support, the process of making a game is complex and there are many possible blockages in the process. -->

In the example above Toby progresses from playtesting his own game to altering it by adding a new platform to the game. Toby retests immediately by clicking on the preview element of the game.
<!-- NOTE - THIS IS MISSING FROM THE VIGNETTE -->

MOVE TO PHASE ?
On this page participant can pick missions from a choice of printed resources. There were four colour themed categories of missions. _Game mechanics_ are features to do with the actions of the game. _Game space_ patterns address the layout of the game. _Game polish_ patterns involve adding music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements. Finally _System and Challenge_ patterns look at how different elements interact to create challenge in the game.

Toby then browses the web page of a menu of game design patterns and selects moving enemies. At this scope of activity the goal is to increase the challenge and variety of the game experience. It appears probable that his is also guided by the expectations embodies in the page itself. EXPLAIN affordances OF DESIGN HERE.

Other participants were less proficient using this online resources and used printed out versions of documentation.

<br />

| **Subject**         | **Objective**             | **Tools & Processes**         
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Individuals (mostly)  | Implementing specific code or design tasks   |  Code editing tool (glitch)   |
|   |   |  Code game preview tool (glitch) |
|   |   |  Piskel  online graphics editor   |
|   |   |  Step by step tutorials on FLOSS manuals  |
|   |   |  Stand-alone code examples on glitch.com  |
|        |     |

Table 4.x.  Tools used in lower-level objectives of implementing specific code structures or stages in creating game assets

<br />

In some of the more complicated game elements there were many different stages in implementing each game design pattern. For example, some patterns involve creating a new graphical element in a separate online editor called Piskel, exporting and downloading it to the laptop, and uploading it to the glitch code playground before making code changes in several parts of the code.

Using the terminology of Activity Theory, each one of these stages can be viewed as a separate operation in the process of completing an action. Some of these operations are performed by Toby quickly and fluently by Toby indicating that he has performed them many times. One example is the quick navigation between the different tools. However some are new to Toby and are performed more hesitantly. For example, Toby is careful in his checking of the process of copying and pasting new code to his game code.

In this example he is competent in the process of comparing the own code to the code example to work out what code is new and relevant to the desired behaviour. He does not check the step by step tutorials which would provide more extensive, step-by-step help.   

Others in the group did not experiment in this way and used more direct help or detailed written instructions.

### Commentary on evolution of design by Phase



### Phase one - an exploratory series of  game making sessions

<!-- NOTE - The evolution involves phases and then tension - what and how to cover both?  -->
<!-- This phase took place before the official start of this research and relevant ethics application. As such,  -->

This stage was aimed not at collecting user data rather than building my own background knowledge and competency as a facilitator. The first phase of delivery in late 2018 was based on initial research stage; I drew on literature to identify factors to consider when designing for collaboration, adopting a project based approach inspired by design thinking. To inculcate parents and children in to the culture of retro video games I began initial sessions by inviting participants to older arcade games on laptops.

<!-- Game filled laptops.  
Should this be added to the table above
-->
<!-- The tools allow participants to create games using a combination of a free to use online tools.

an online  coding environment
using the phaser javascript game library (glitch.com), a pixel art editor (piskelapp.com), and a sound effect generator (sfbgames.com/chiptone). -->

In terms of supporting resources, stage one was responsive; I had no pre-existing supporting materials and created a starting code framework of a platform game and code examples to add extra functionality to the game as the programme developed.

Some of methods emerged from the start including;

- play testing of other games as a fun and productive activity (DEVELOP?)
- the use of drama / warm up games - a normal part of my project based learning approach with adults designed
- a final public showcase - At the end of this stage participants showed their games to students in the foyer of the MMU Brooks building and gave me feedback on their participation in the programme.



### Phase Two

THIS SECTION NEEDS A LOT OF WORK - ADDRESSING DUPLICATION WITH THE ABOVE AND INTEGRATING ANALYSIS

**Transition to Phase 2 due to feedback**

Key extracts from participant feedback follow.

- Feedback from one family that dropped out as production changed from planning and asset design to implementation in code. The felt alienated by the "hardcore coding" that was happening around them.
- There was a general consensus that the process was too long general consensus
- more or work out right format


Phase two presented key challenges. The first was to try to present the essence of my evolving learning design of phaser and a code playground to  PGCE students in a smaller time scale. And in the process of preparing a 90 minute workshop for the Mozilla conference

With guidance, PGCE students created printable resources that highlighted particular key lines of code and variables that had a high impact on the game experiences. These include changing gravity, altering the player speed, background colour of the game and the game layout of the platforms, hazards and food to collect.

This approach was more prescriptive than I would have adopted, however it worked well. I then made a connection between

 -->

#### The half-baked starting platformer game

The use and design characteristics of the starting point of a half-baked game

- Phaser 2 to avoid complexity of code structure
- 2D platformer - familiar to most - Mario and Sonic
- low-spec graphics
- game of player, platforms, and coins to collect and hazards to avoid.
- graphical level design
- key variables brought to the top
- simple structure of code in terms of aligning with framework and not adding extra functions


#### Phase Three

The delivery of the second phase in early 2019 drew on this participant feedback and detailed reading of relevant literature to bring substantial changes to the programme.

The key addition built on the quick cards of the previous phase, that being to preprepare code examples illustrating key game features requested by participants.

In phase one I worked with learners when they were creating a wish list of game features to add to their game. Some of these were aesthetic in nature to do with the graphical representation of game characters, hazards and background images. Some most accurately described as game mechanics including: jumping on enemies; finding a door or flag to progress to the next level; and collect all food before progressing to next level. Others concerned other fundamental aspects concerning game space including: size of game world,

Some requests did not fit into these categories - see Schell's lenses work for a more complete taxonomy.

We can describe these features as game design patterns. Driv(Appendix R.4.1)en by the requests of learners, I developed tutorials to support students implement these patterns. This approach aligns with inclusive education principles in that it increases the choices of students, scaffolds the way they can access resources and allows them to keep a track of their own progress.




#### Phase Four

<!-- I also carried out four video-recorded interviews with practitioners who work with creative methods and technology with young people or families. Early analysis of these interviews has helped shape the evolving design of my programme and has brought into focus key areas of interest already identified in journal entries. -->

This iteration was very similar in terms of tool use to the previous phase with one small change. I revised the an online project-hub to link to the project chapters rather than the code examples.

In addition, I drew on some previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department [@caldwell_drama_2019] to create a simple drama process to give a simple external motivation and narrative to the creation of games for a fictional audience of visiting aliens. This element of the learning design was designed to increase engagement of young people, to scaffold meta-reflection processes, and to allow parents to explore digital issues.

These aspects inform the first half of the next chapter which addresses the process of creating an inclusive creative coding environment.



**Learners may feel alienated from coding as a practice and need a way into the process.**
Drama and fictional scenarios can help explore issues and reduce learner anxiety though coding in a role.


<!-- there's a limit here as the drama scenario is done on people already engaged
so there's a problem in getting any data from this
however the rationale is intact and  -->

#### Phase Five

I ran two iterations of game making course of 4-5 weeks using MakeCode Arcade tool. MakeCode Arcade uses block language system similar to that of Scratch, inheriting those advatages (list here or previous) FIND SOURCE - HOW TO BEST REFER BACK TO LIT REVIEW?

The template, resources and facilitation approach was based closely on the previous stages but adapted to use screenshots of the block code of the MakeCode Arcade tool.





### Commentary on tensions emerging - IDEALLY FIND SOME KIND OF GROUPING - CURRENLY BY PHASE ONLY

<!-- NOTE - DEVELOP THIS ASPECT OF INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT TO REDUCE STRESS - MOVE FROM NEXT CHAPTER?  -->


#### Exploring key tensions in phase one

**Learner disengagement if game coding is taught in an instructionist / from first principles (especially in younger ages)**
In my journal notes, I reflect on the difficulty of interupting the flow of making activities once they are underway. I thus began avoiding stopping making to share points to the whole class and avoid demonstrating key concepts on the screen.

**Learner anxiety if hardcore coding environment and peer working dynamics**
One family dropped out and in their exit interview they shared that at one point we looked around and just saw people doing hardcore coding and we no longer felt at home in the environment. In this emergent design, they had mostly completed asset design and narrative development and the only coding remained. I thus wanted to address the tension between completing the project and alienation from just coding.

<!-- The value of playfulness is illustrated with one exit interview with a parent where they shared their reasons for leaving the program. At one stage after a week where they had missed a session, their family looked around and saw other groups involved in 'hardcore coding' and no longer felt at home. They compared this previous sessions which had more fun and group oriented activity.

I was struck that his incident happened during a session where I had not played customary drama games to create an inclusive environment. The games had been omitted as I was responding to a sense of urgency coming from families to solve problems. The scarcity in facilitator time drove me to crack on supporting families to debug code errors. The incident lead me to greater reflection on ongoing measures needed to prevent participant drop out for due to cultural tensions and negative affect to the working community. These include:

-   An awareness of the danger that those more confident in coding create more involved code problems that need more facilitator time, potentially making others feel less valued.
-   A concern for the fragility of learners positive affect towards the group game making process and thus the need for initial playful starting and closing activities to be continued beyond initial sessions.
-   The value of a stronger buy-in by participants, ideally a greater commitment to the collective making process balanced with thx`e need for low pressure (avoiding a negative sense of obligation). -->

**Encouraging peer learning vs social restrictions**
The same family also gave useful feedback about social norms of not bothering people getting in the way of asking for help.

<!-- NOTE See this source
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VL8FPnrBUbcpwL1nmGLCsF1t2JjkitQV_3N8DYeFcoM/edit
 -->

**Freedom of participation vs benefitting from parental involvement**
The process of parents getting in the way of children's not minding jumping in and invading social space struck me. Rather than the larger groups, smaller groups, allowing some children to work by themselves and others with parents. Avoiding large group framentation

**Learners may not find coding a project a motivating project if it is only a private activity with no end audience.**
Play Testing - each lesson can help with short term motivation of having a game product ready  for others to play.  Showcase events help longer-term motivation towards and aid prioritisation as learners near the end of their project.

**Code playground provides immediate feedback**. I chose a code editing tool set which drew on relevant design principles explored in the literature review (Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013).
One of the principles that I prioritised in the choice of tools was that of immediate feedback for participants. For example, in the code editing interface of glitch.com shown in Illustration 1, changes made to the code on the left section take immediate effect in the resultant game on the right side of the screen.

**Authenticity of coding environment**.  

Javascript as coding language, Phaser as a game making framework and Glitch as a code environment, are highly authentic and used by both professional coders and enthusiasts alike.

Javascript is an authentic language, core to modern web pages and applications. Phaser is a professional and enthusiast framework. Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals. In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity and thus an ability . My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics.

 FIND SUPPORT FROM MOZILLA WHITE PAPER - JUSTIFY EFFORT OF JS AS A STARTING LANGUAGE

 Phaser is a javascript framework embedded in html page. Unlike many game making tools this tools set can be extended to other kinds of projects and is a professional and foundational toolset used to build the majority of websites and many phone applications.



<!-- An unusual approach so why?

- involvement with mozilla / teach the web
- authenticity - link between developer community and education, global in scope
- can use a cut and paste, remix, irreverant approach - link to media activist / hacktivist pirate cultures.

- could bring in other web creation resource, piskel, -->

**Learner choice over game design vs templated approach**

Learners struggled with too much freedom of choice in a number of ways. Most specifically starting from scratch appeared unrealistic for this group due to technical level of coding availability. Similarly, there was at times frustration if learners were not able to implement a feature they wanted to add to the game next:


While personal expression can facilitates engagement and motivation it can lead to confict if desired changes are not realistic. For example there was conflict over desire for a 3d game in this phase. A 3d bee design of one participant which happened when there was no framework.
Present a wide range of different kinds of design patterns that learners can add to their game in the order they choose (with some exceptions).

As such I adapted a game template used in a Phaser tutorial. Thus the design started to follow the Use-Modify-Create model to limit learner anxiety for novice coders and to scaffold the acquisition of coding and computational thinking concepts [@lee_computational_2011]. Using a starting template had a number of benefits: to increase speed of feedback from learner input, to reduce coding syntax knowledge needed in starting from scratch, x

In order to accelerate the process of making a game to fit into contextual expectations of an acceptable project timeframe, I pre-chose the genre of game to be made and based on my previous teaching experience, analysis of literature and knowledge of platform games, I pre-prepared a set of coded example and tutorials to implement a range of game design patterns.



**Restricted community - e.g. why not scratch?**



Beyond technical considerations regarding scratch and use of physics etc,

Learning technology in community settings can engender feelings of agency and motivation from part of wide network and the  diverse pathways. [@blunden_interdisciplinary_2009.

Time consideration of the process of being involved in an online community may remove time spent doing real life playtesting.

Also - the diversity of creations available on a online commmunity  could remove the more communal experience of the designed limitations.




#### Addressing tensions and related to support materials and documentation emerging in phase two
 <!-- NOTE -
 The language used, affordances, 2nd stimulation, practices, needs clarification.
  -->

Most forms of future documentation and support were originated at this stage. This section specifically addresses the evolution of documentation via analysis of the development of the resources.

 <!-- NOTE - I am not totally sure it is necessary. Could it be collapsed or presented in another part of this chapter.
 NOTE - Try to summarise exactly what the message is here.  
 NOTE - how can this be more analytical.  -->




 **Use of simple code examples which demonstrate the pattern in isolation**

 Code examples were initially the starting resource. The idea being it was quick to see the behaviour in context. This was changed after this iteration based on the difficulty of finding the relevant section on step-by-step resources.

 These code example are a staple of professional sharing and problem solving practice.
 They exist on the Phaser website, however their use there is not consistent and sometimes, as with many developer created documentation, focused on demonstrating the code constructs in isolation rather than in context.

 **Non-linear step-by-step instructions**

 Longer form step by step tutorials are common in computing education. Examples can be found in Code Academy, and in the education resources of RPi foundation. Many examples talking learners through steps to build a game can be found online with varied amount of explanation of underlying constructs and concepts. I started my journey learning JS games using some provided by Mozilla and the Phaser developers.

 The approach used in the step based documentation I created varies from many in that rather than choosing a defined order users can choose which order they want to add game elements. The use of GDP aids the learner navigation of this process. This does add challenges however to the documentation authouring process.

 <!-- An example of parent Sh interaction with long form tutorial follows. Sh engaged with the long form resources. While this process did not involve dialogue, the recording of her screen allows for a detailed description of how the resources was used.

 Sh opens browswer to see list of code Examples, navigates to page, sees list of chapters, selects GDP pattern name, then follows along.
 FIND THIS EXAMPLE AND WRITE IT UP / SEE WHAT IT ADDS TO THIS SECTION. -->

 Interestingly, the online menus was not used by participants in any regular or consistent way. However, it did have a trickle down effect. Some trailblazing participants did either browse it, use it to try to solve problems or were referred to it my the facilitators. The patterns that those learners implemented were then remarked upon by other learners and sometimes adopted via peer teaching.

 <!-- As explored in the literature review, it is difficult to explore this pedagogical approach relation to other similar programmes due to the lack of data on specifics of the learning materials presented to participants. -->

 **Linear support tutorials**

 While a manual was available, few participants worked their way through it chapter by chapter. While I created this for the planners suited to this way of working and in response to feedback from parents in early designs that foundation knowledge would be useful, in practice, once their template game was up and running, there was little incentive to do use this resource. In terms of the objectives of making a playable game or adding particular patterns to the game the step by step resources would have involved backtracking. The process would have value to reinforce computing concepts present in the design.

 The foundational concept here was that after making the game from a template. The linear resources would explain all underlying concepts that the starting template had initially abstracted away from the participants.

 In my journal I named this concept _meeting yourself in the middle_ to represent the possibility of retracing the process of learning from first principles.
 Narratively the equivalent of a prequel.   

#### Tensions and related to navigation of various documentations sources

The previous stage had created a variety of supporting documents and processes. In phase two I struggled to communicate these options consistently and effectively to students.

**Use of a non-linear menu of game design patterns**

In PBL, UDL and other models - learner choice and building agency is shown to be of value in increasing engagement and ownership over learning. However, building the relevant knowledge to identify, agree on and implement game patterns from scratch takes time and without relevant scaffolding too so long that it negatively impacted motivation.

Learning resources linked to game design patterns were presented in a menu format. They were made more accessible with graphics focused on the player experience rather than underlying coding constructs. The purpose of this design work was to;

- increase learner engagement through accessible design
- make documentation relatable to existing gameplay experience
- develop use of common GPD terminology

THE FOLLOWING IS EXPLORED IN EXAMPLE ABOVE - RELATE IT SOMEHOW AND FIND ANALYSIS HERE.
There were two main ways of approaching adding a new pattern. One to examing a code example which was built around the same code base.

This would involve searching for new code constructs and notes in the code designed to orientate the learner, alerting them to the location and purpose of the relevant code. The other was longer form step by step help.

### Building Identities as Game Makers DROP THIS FOR NOW MOVE TO NEW PAPER

My journal notes see an evolution of attempts to try to build into the program, activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers or more generally digital designers. In and early tentative attempt to define in broad strokes the types of game maker behaviour and underlying goals. In doing this I have taken inspiration from Bartle's game player types Hamari and Tuunanen, 2014). I translated player types to maker types based on notes in my observation journal and extracts from screen capture data. The following list of *Game Maker *types:

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
- **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
-   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
-   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

For examples in the Vignette of S and T's interaction we can see attributes of the child as a Glitcher. In terms of understanding of the game as a dynamic system, this is seen clearly in the parent's alarm at the child's deletion of all elements of hazard. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. "It's no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid." The child seems determined to remove all hazards. My understanding is that she is also aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play. They seem to take pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context. The process mirrors play theory concept of playing against the game or dark play Sutton-smith, 2001).

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with th##### Building Identities as Game Makers

One warm activities that took on a life of its own was a group activity of taking a Bartle test (what kind of game player are you) as extended spectrum line/grid activity [FIND DESCRIPTION SOURCE]. The process of exploring identity in this way surfaced the cheekiness of some young people and the pleasure they took in demonstrating their playful mischievousness. I began to make journal notes on this subject and talk to other games study practioners. I began to ask the question can the surfacing maker types (as per player types) encourage awareness and celebrate the emerging practices that the community was producing.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you. -->



##### Using Physical Maps of Missions as Game Design Patterns

Maps in the 3M model were explored partly as a way of representing the personal dimension of learning.

To support younger coders unsure what to do next or who struggle to stay on task, I sought to create another kind of map to help them navigate their game making journey. I printed out a large-scale colour map of a coastal landscape stylised in a way that mirrored a map used for navigation in a quest-themed computer game.

The game pattern missions were represented as different islands . Learners took time to create and personalise a movable marker representing themselves. When learners selected their next mission, they moved their counter to the relevant island. Thus learners had to be intentional about their next goal and were implicitly encouraged to stick to it. They also kept a track of the missions that they had completed by tracing a trail as they progressed. In addition the colourful, physical and visual representation served to encourage a sense of community and peer learning. When moving the counter on the map I prompted them to reflect on the coding concepts or other learning dimensions that they had been working with. As learners traced a trail between the different island/missions they had visited, the map provoked learners to reflect on their journey and progress. However, this approach may be too labour and time intensive for many class environments. I am currently investigating replicating this process using online tools to reduce complexity and preparation time.

<!-- Starting with a template and creating resources to help common patterns helped resolve this tension. However having this menu of choices also created another issue. Increased confusion. -->

EXAMPLE - ma & fi - Paper maps

Having GDP mapped out had some of the following possibilities.

Maps as an area seems to be the weakest point in this process. I may have neglected this plane as it is normally well explored in other research based in formal settings, and I was particularly interested in nurturing an organically forming game making community.

This section highlights key tensions in the design that still need to be overcome.

It explores these tensions in relation to existing research and contains further discussion to inform possible future directions of research.

I translated player types to maker types based on notes in my observation journal and extracts from screen capture data. The following list of *Game Maker *types:

 -   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
 - **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
 -   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
 -   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users map in MakeCode iteration which is digital and analysis of data showed an emerging tensions. There are benefits of mapping it in a more visual and collaborative way as shown by the attempts to do it with paper and individuals mapping their progress with markers.

A much more collaborative online map which showed other peoples progress would be possible with an investment in time and perhaps more expertise in software development. Perhaps moving towards a gamification league and tactics. This could cause potential issues with a more competitive atmosphere. -->

**Teacher stress if they are not able to support a very diverse set of features demanded by students working on diverse kinds of games.**-  
Limit the type of game to one kind. Offer a significant but limited menu of missions that users can add. Offer written and visual support documents which learners can access independently of facilitators

**Learners take on features which are too advanced or complex for their current coding level**
(Appendix R.4.1)
The use of a physical map on which GDP were arranged aimed to communicate which patterns were more complicated to implement.  Starting patterns limited the maximum complexity of missions and present patterns to encourage learners to start with ones that involve simple code changes but return a large change in terms of gameplay experience.

##### Building Identities as Game Makers

NOTE - THIS COULD WORK IN THE INTRODUCTION TO THE CHAPTER - LINK WITH PREVIOUS ONE.

One warm activities that took on a life of its own was a group activity of taking a Bartle test (what kind of game player are you) as extended spectrum line/grid activity [FIND DESCRIPTION SOURCE]. The process of exploring identity in this way surfaced the cheekiness of some young people and the pleasure they took in demonstrating their playful mischievousness. I began to make journal notes on this subject and talk to other games study practioners. I began to ask the question can the surfacing maker types (as per player types) encourage awareness and celebrate the emerging practices that the community was producing.

My journal notes see an evolution of attempts to try to build into the program, activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers or more generally digital designers. In and early tentative attempt to define in broad strokes the types of game maker behaviour and underlying goals. In doing this I have taken inspiration from Bartle's game player types Hamari and Tuunanen, 2014). I translated player types to maker types based on notes in my observation journal and extracts from screen capture data. The following list of *Game Maker *types:

 -   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   
 - **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
 -   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
 -   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users



## Learning Dimensions Map



In this phase, I adapted and extended resources to suit use in more formal learning environments, e.g. particularly a secondary computing classroom.


In learning environments where there is a lot of choice assessing learners via observation is beneficial. Rather than deciding what you want to teach and testing students on that area, you can map the learning happening in an authentic activity.

When researching hands-on tinkering in Science museums Bevan and Petrich [-@petrich_it_2013] worked with educators to examine video footage of families interacting with exhibits to make a structured list of the learning they observed. The resulting map of learning dimensions included underlying science concepts but also contained more general skills and helping behaviours involved in exploratory learning processes.

// REWRITE FOLLOWING
<!-- Another chapter in this collection identified concept maps and observation as methods for teachers and researchers to identify key learning suited to particular computing projects.  -->

One of the outcomes of my research was to extract some of the concepts and practices that learners engaged with when making games from hours of recorded material. While some are common to existing Computational Thinking frameworks others, including systems thinking concepts, are more unique to game making. Table 4.x. shows my resulting map of learning dimensions for the 3M game making model.

|      Coding Concepts    | Systems Patterns    | Design Practices|
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Sequences | Systems Elements      | Goal Setting        |
| Variables      | Systems Dynamics  | Being Incremental and Iterative       |
| Logic | Reinforcing Feedback Loops      | Developing Vocabulary        |
| Loops | Balancing Feedback Loops      | Web Navigation    |
| Arrays |       | Problem Solving        |
| Creating Functions |       | Version Control    |
| Change Listener |    | Debugging   |
| Input Event |   | Reusing and Remixing      |


This process of mapping such frameworks may be overly time-consuming for many full-time teachers. However, teachers may also use and adapt existing maps and frameworks based on their own classroom experience to help their observation of students. Because these frameworks can also help students to navigate their own learning journey the effort serves a double purpose.

<!--
While this is an informal way of using maps the are other approaches that are more formal including one called a concept map which is a visual representation of target specialised knowledge. There is a section on concept maps as part of the teach computing website here. https://blog.teachcomputing.org/how-we-teach-computing/. -->

### Limits to this map - MOVE?

This map was designed to link with particular conceptions of learning whilst still retaining a sense of the uniqueness of the affordances of this design. The settings are, CT in school curriculums, systems thinking, design approaches. These align broadly with a STEM approach. The rationale behind this is that Game Making commonly aligns with these curriculum areas and they are particularly suited to explore via iterative game making.
NOTE - EXPLAIN WHERE THAT IS EXPLORED IN MORE DETAIL.

However, there are a broad range of other skills and literacies also relevant with evidence emerging in video data.

My own work in this area has been informed by work developing teaching materials for the Mozilla Foundation as part of the Teach the Web programme. This programme introduced a broad set of competencies name Web Literacies [@noauthor_learning/webliteracystandard/legacy/webliteracieswhitepaper_nodate] [@mozilla_foundation_webmaker_2014].

- digital literacy - broad overview
- web literacy - narrower
- webmaker - and more specific affordances of key web based coding and exploring tools


<!-- NOTE EXPAND IF USEFUL -->
Note - while the use of these skills is not unique to game making and common to pick up on many making situations, the use of external image and sound asset creation tools which then creates production pipeline process does engender key navigation and importing and exporting skills which are very valuable in online environments.

NOTE - The map could easily be changed to reflect this or other foci of teachers / researchers.


### Including Coding Concepts in the Learning Map and including Code Cards with links to online Concepts

Recap here the choice of coding concepts rather that CT in more abstract terms.

- Make Code cards which contained links to game design patterns and the different component concepts
- (see Eriksson and Bjork)
- Draw on material and critique in chapter on semantic profiles / waves.

<!-- A theme to follow up in the Maps / personal learning chapter is that of picking up on some of the behaviour of participants, especially that of experienced parents, experience either in coding practices of supporting their children. Once identified, how could beneficial interactions be encouraged in the next iteration of design.

Examples include;

- supporting reflection on design and coding concepts / skills.
- navigation / organisational support - use of a physical map.

For example, the use of CT concepts in a framework, listed as part of the initial design pattern card, which could then be discussed, ticked off or otherwise reflected on. -->




**Facilitators may need to justify learning happening and struggle to see this in-situ if unfamiliar with the game making process. This may restrict openness of activities to better assess and support learning.**
A map of learning dimensions flexibly linked to main missions/patterns can be used by both learners and facilitators.


**tension adapting resources to a curriculum environment**
There were some additional changes in the way that design patterns were presented to learners mirroring design patterns on other domains including: name; need ; related patterns. In addition related concepts in computational thinking and design processes which are promoted as part of the recent computing curriculum were included and linked to a learning dimensions map.
 <!-- .  WHERE TO PUT EXAMPLE? of design pattern current -->

In addition, material which mapped and explained learning dimensions including design skills and computational concepts were included in the participant support resources.

**Addition of a Game Challenge section**

I wanted to explore the possibility to use this model to explore systems thinking. There is precedent to do this in GSM.

It was driven in a response to meaningful missions which helped guide a focus on game play.

I created such missions (outlined in Methods chapter)
Added game design patterns based on challenge - find source Schnell & GSM literature (their terminology is Game elements)
And then updated the learning map to highlight potential concepts to be learned.

**Systems concepts are embedded in many games but the process of direct teaching of such systems can be complex and interrupt and distract from other design activities.**

Systems related missions were designed. (If so not clearly tested) Challenge section in particular mirrors systems concepts.

Extra missions which highlight game challenge and user experience may help learners to explore systems concepts within the game context

<!-- ### Stages of Design

#### Evolution of Template and supporting resources
I'm not sure if this even goes into this chapter - it certainly starts to answer some of the research questions.

## Further discussion of learning design - HOLDING SECTION CURRENTLY

In the previous discussion surrounding tensions the focus was on tool use to directly achieve the objective of the activity. However, this ignore the lower community layer of the 3rd generation AT namely: division of labour; rules/norms; and community. In this section more cultural and community related tensions are explored.

<!-- INSERT Diagram. AT generic. -->

<!-- NOTE - SOME OF THESE TENSION MAY BE BETTER EXPLORED IN OTHER CHAPTERS IF THERE IS OVERLAP - and some in the final discussions - Select 2 or 3 most relevant to this chapter -->

The following are a list of tensions observed in early game making experiments that I recorded in journal form. More likely have some starting tensions from early design stages, that are then analysed in relation to other sources and data, and other resolutions that are more general or sophisticated emerge.

### Discussion on tensions in relation to Lit Review and REQUESTS

**Work of Gee and others on identity of makers / coders**

Link with game making - identities above?

The process of creating assets builds in Molly the identity of a proficient maker. She wants to build on her achievement of being an "expert pixel". As explored in literature review the possibility to change and to play with identity is important in the work of Gee.
FIND RELEVANT LINKS HERE - CALL BACK TO LIT REVIEW

His work explores the role of the design of games and the surrounding communities that build up around games to support an nurture the development of player identities. The process is shown to have beneficial effects in supporting the creative interations with games and play.

In a similar vein, drama processes like the mantle of the expert are designed and enacted by facilitators in ways whic allow participants to draw on their existing knowledge and encourages them to put this into practice in fictional scenarios.

The next chapter outlines the delivery and start to explore the impact of
- the process drama used
- authentic tools
- emerging processes




<!-- NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH THIS IN THIS CHAPTER
 **Facilitators may have a more linear and limited view of ‘progress’ than learners:**

 Side missions which explore and celebrate different ‘maker types’ (informed by Bartle’s player types) can provide the opportunity to discuss characteristics of different making/design approaches.   -->

<!-- #### Tensions related to choice of pathways -->

<!-- In PBL, UDL and other models - learner choice and building agency is shown to be of value in increasing engagement and ownership over learning.

Howver, in starting experiments I observed that the long time in building the relevant knowledge to identify, agree on and implement game patterns negatively impacted motivation.

In order to accelerate the process of making a game to fit into contextual expectations of an acceptable project timeframe, I pre-chose the genre of game to be made and based on my previous teaching experience, analysis of literature and knowledge of platform games, I pre-prepared a set of coded example and tutorials to implement a range of game design patterns. -->


<!--
MOVED TO DISCUSSION CHAPTER??
### Personal Dimension of the Learning - Personal Appropriation
In line with sociocultural approaches Rogoff points out the limits of an understanding of knowledge which promotes a view of knowledge as transmission from teacher to learner and is thus an individual process. Instead this exploration of knowledge and practices is framed as a mutual process.

While, this is potentially problematic in classroom environments, the mutuality of the process is evident in my responses to tensions via changes in design and spontaneous practices and understandings of knowledge required to make games enacted by participants.  

One significant tension I felt in evolving design was a nagging feeling that learning happening should be documented, or linked to some kind of curriculum. There are elements of the design which suit development of coding concepts and Computational Thinking.
However, I felt reluctance to explicitly teach these links via direct transmission. -->


<!-- #### Tensions related to fundsThe use of a physical map on which GDP were arranged aimed to communicate which patterns were more complicated to implement.

 on knowledge / culture -->


<!-- **If it is not recorded, learners and facilitators may lose track of what has been covered in the process of making a game. Thus reducing opportunities for project reflection. However, stopping activity to record formally interrupts the enjoyment of game making.**

Tracing the learner pathway on an attractive physical map in the learning space can help integrate navigation and reflection into the creative process. -->




<!--
PERHAPS INCLUDE ABOVE IN PHASES IN PART
**Learners interact with code primarily using the mouse keyboard and screen which does not take advantage of benefits of physical computing for learner engagement.**
Connecting arcade buttons to the computer via simple electronics is a project which can be completed quickly. The process of students building their own arcade cabinets for a games showcase increased their perception of the authenticity of their end goal
 -->

<!-- MOVE LATER?
**Online resources vs Print outs**
Also a tension of moving online with resources, via having them available in the class.
Try to resolve with a summary as a laminated card, and then online as well - this tension is partly to do with the data gathering process, as it is easier to follow if it is visible on the screen. -->

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FIPn2dEB2aCKZi5z05j69cnHgpGNXFh1_SPV6h5l12g/edit#
Thus setting out a path for the following chapters. -->

<!-- Rogoff's [-@rogoff_observing_1995-1] describes three planes of personal, social and community activity which she advocates as foci for analysis. The model problematises the dichotomy of learner led, teacher led approaches [@mascolo_beyond_2009] in a way which suits the space between formal and informal learning that this community based model of game making occupies.

While the author's original research was on indigenous cultural practices on a village level, the model has been applied in both formal and informal educational settings; including FIND THREE EXAMPLES -

In this research I am interested in the way that facilitators can help nurture community practices and also in the way that participants have co-created the learning design created in this research and how participant practices have evolved. -->

<!--
In this section I outline Rogoff's initial conceptions of activities happening in three planes and related them to emergent activities in the game making community of this research. _I will also bring in critical counterpoints from relevant theory and compare to other "authentic"  teaching frameworks including PBL as a way to widening this analysis._

## Link to next chapter

This chapter has dealt with the evolution of design in initial phases and responses to learner experience to resolve tensions.

Due to the complexity and many moving parts of the design it has been mostly descriptive.

While CHAT provides the technique of highlighting emerging tensions and resolutions, to undertake deeper analysis I will an analytical process proposed by Rogoff which examines learning communities using 3 foci.

This process begins in this chapter with a focus on evolving design and continues in with three following chapters with a greater focus on the learner response to challenges of game making in the recorded sessions.
