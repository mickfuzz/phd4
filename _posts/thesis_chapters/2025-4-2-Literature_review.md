# Literature Review

## Research Questions April 2025

- **Primary research question (RQP):** How can understandings of how to design and facilitate CGD&P be enriched using socio-cultural approaches (used in this study)?

- **Sub-question 1 (RQ1):** What contradictions arose in this research’s evolving design process and how were they addressed in the resulting CGD&P pedagogy?

- **Sub-question 2 (RQ2):** How can the use of a collection of game design patterns support CGD&P, in particular in relation to abstract and concrete dimensions of existing pedagogies?

- **Sub-question 3 (RQ3):** How can varied dimensions of agency be identified and nurtured in an evolving community of game makers?

This chapter reviews the literature to summarise research  addressing the aims of this study. It explores several broad themes to establish a comprehensive understanding of the field. Firstly, I examine the findings of research and reviews in the areas of computer game design and programming. Then I outline key concerns of the work of constructionist researchers in the broader field of supporting programming education and more specifically within CGD&P as a way of highlighting promising areas for future research.

The review then addresses pedagogical approaches that are pertinent to the research concerns of this thesis beginning with wider field of computer programming and focusing in on those specifically addressing game making.

Due to the sociocultural focus of this study, attention is also paid to the research on the potential and characteristics of non-formal learning programmes where game making may take place. Specifically, I summarise relevant research on code clubs, competitions and game jams.

A significant focus is placed on the use of game design patterns (GDPs), where I highlight their use in computing education. This includes analysis of a strand of research investigating the use of collections of GDPs by novice game designers.

Subsequently, I explore how this review has informed the proposed problem statement of this thesis, emphasising the need for developing novel and robust pedagogies in this area which support learner agency. This sets the stage for subsequent exploration of agency in Chapter 3, which outlines the the theoretical framework of the study. By addressing these themes, the literature review not only situates the current study within the broader academic discourse but also underscores the importance of innovative pedagogical approaches in fostering inclusive game making communities.

Given that this literature review aims to explore existing relevant pedagogies within the research field, a working definition of pedagogy is appropriate given the socio-cultural focus of this study. The following definition aligns with the socio-cultural approach of this study.  "Pedagogy refers to that set of instructional techniques and strategies which enable learning to take place and provide opportunities for the acquisition of knowledge, skills, attitudes and dispositions within a particular social and material context." [@siraj-blatchford_researching_2002]


<!-- In the context of activity theory, pedagogy can be framed as pedagogical tools and processes, functioning as a type of mediational strategy.

## A review of research on CGD&P and constructionist approaches to learning computer coding

<!-- ### Potential benefits of computer game design and programming (CGD&P) -->

This section begins by addressing studies on computer game design and programming (CGD&P) before progressing to give an overview of constructionist research in this area. These two areas of research are addressed before other more specific pedagogies in part to give a wider perspective of overarching concerns in this area. In addition, given the influential nature of constructionist framings of research within the field, it is productive to examine this influence critically.

<!-- Before addressing specific pedagogies to programming in general and game making in particular, it is of value to examine the broad context of motivations for undertaking -->


### The benefits of computer game design and programming (CGD&P)

Several notable reviews explore the motivations, processes, and benefits of making games for learning  [@denner_does_2019; @earp_game_2015; @hayes_making_2008; @kafai_constructionist_2015-1; @gee_video_2016]. While Gee and Tran [-@gee_video_2016] discuss the diverse tools available for game design. For Bermingham and colleagues CGD&P competencies are framed as 21st Century Skills [@bermingham_approaches_2013], a focus echoed in  a wider review on digital making encompassing game making [@lamas_making_2019]. In their review of the potential of CGD&P to encourage collaboration, Earp and colleagues found that "analysis of collaboration is mainly restricted to peer review and providing feedback" [@earp_learner_2013]. Hayes and Games [-@hayes_making_2008] take a broader approach, identifying four main motivations for CGD&P: learning computer programming skills, deepening subject knowledge of other curricular subjects, involving more girls in computer programming, and using game design to understand design concepts.

Kafai and Burke's [-@kafai_constructionist_2015-1] review synthesises 55 relevant papers within the framework of constructionist gaming focuses on varied strands of the potential of CGD&P and the barriers to participation (explored in Chapter 1). The most developed section is on the benefits and motivations of CGD&P research to address the development of personal dimensions of knowledge and skills. Strong areas within that are computer science knowledge and programming, maths and science and a range of technical abilities that facilitate participation in the information society. Additionally, social dimensions such as pair programming, social skills, self-reflection, cultural awareness are addressed. The authors note limitations in the presentation of may findings in terms of detail regarding the  discussion of pedagogies used, however what studies do detail pedagogies are not shared in the review [@illingworth_review_2017].

A review of CGD&P by Denner and colleagues [@denner_does_2019] is positive about the the effectiveness of CGD&P to develop computing science learning and motivation. Denner et al.'s finding focus on computer science learning, breaking this broader concept into subcategories of programming knowledge and problem specification and design. Importantly, Denner et al. [@denner_does_2019] also outline three strands of pedagogical interest: design-build-test, step-based instruction, and social pedagogical approaches. However, these strands are described only in general terms. Later in this chapter, these strands and related pedagogies are addressed in more detail.

Given the limitations of the reviews outline above to address an more detailed overview of pedagogical approaches used (to build agency?), this chapter will address research which does describe pedagogies in more detail drawing first on wider computing pedagogies for novices before exploring those related to game design and programming in more details. Before undertaking this more detailed review it is also of value to describe the breadth of innovations and subsequent research by the constructionist school both to acknowledge the significance of this research and to give a broad overview of themes that will be developed subsequently.

<!-- THIS COULD BE A GOOD CHANCE TO GO INTO THIS MORE - ADN THEN DROP DESIGN STAGES ALTOGETHER FROM THIS THESIS!!! -->
<!-- Similarly, while studies on the community use of game making, in after-school and online settings exist [@kafai2012collaborative; @peppler_computer_2009; @luther_leadership_2011], details of pedagogies to develop community participation, as explored later in this chapter, are often scant.  -->

<!--
    David Buckingham’s (2003) review of media education described a long history of how making can support critical understanding, and how this can encourage a more critical and contextualised understanding of production and the making process. This additionally meshes with constructivist beliefs in how making is a better way of understanding than simple instruction (Papert, 1993), and lies at the heart of some of the new orthodoxies about critical participation (Jenkins et al, 2007) [@sefton-green_mapping_2013]-->

<!-- Of particular interest to this study are studies exploring the social and cultural dimensions of CGD&P.

<!-- This deficit in addressing and assessing pedagogies used, is reflective of a comparatively weakness of concepts of pedagogy within the wider constructionist theory, a dimension which is explored after the next section barriers to participation. -->

<!-- In related work, Robertson's drew on storytelling games, to access participant knowledge in accessible ways []] -->
<!-- What is missing?
Other studies show games as a potential vehicle for exploring issues involving race, sex, social issues. -->


### An overview of constructionist approaches

<!-- Before turning to a more detailed exploration of distinct pedagogies used in or appropriate for CGD&P,  -->

<!-- Turning first to how games are special.
However, while the inclusion games clearly favour these elements, the  use of home interests and the use of a playful approach are not unique to game making.
Kafai and Burke

also note the benefits to exploring games over other types of media projects, including their inherent interactivity and rules based systems, which facilitate the exploration of systems thinking and design approaches [@games_gamestar_2010; @tekinbas_gaming_2014; @games_design_2008]. However, in order to foreground those elements, programming is dropped from the tool to reduce complexity. -->

The work of constructionist researchers is foundational in the field programming education. Examples include the work of Papert pioneering LOGO, programmable LEGO drawing turtles [@papert_mindstorms_1980; @papert_turtles_2002; @papert_childrens_1993], early research by Kafai on game programming by children [@kafai_minds_1994], and  innovations in creative computing by Resnick in the areas of physical computing [@resnick_digital_1998] and a more generalised multi-media authoring tool (called Scratch)[@resnick_reflections_2005].  Kafai and Burke’s framing of CGD&P as _constructionist gaming_ reflects the dominance of this voice  within the field with many of the researchers undertaking work in this area identifying their work as following constructionist principles [@harel_caperton_toward_2010; @repenning_scalable_2010; @weintrop_computational_2016; @kynigos_children_2018].

However, despite this influence, the ethos and theoretical underpinning of constructionism are difficult to locate precisely [@laurillard2020significance, p.29]. This may in part be due to the varied interpretation of the concepts as an "epistemological paradigm, a learning theory and a design framework" [@kynigos_constructionism:_2015]. This section situates the concerns of this thesis within the existing body of constructionist research before widening the focus to explore the principle strands within it. To achieve this, I will examine several strands of constructionist research, namely: design principles and pedagogical approaches, and engagement with social approaches to learning.

<!-- In addition, the focus has shifted Papert's early focus on objects to think with was interpreted as an expansion to Piaget's constructivism [@ackermann_piagets_2001]. Resnick [-@resnick2014give] and other constructionist researchers have advocated for software and hardware tools that promote an open-ended, child-led approach to designing relatable objects of interest. The framing of Kafai and Burke of CGD&P as constructionist gaming widens the scope still further. -->



Early constructionist research by Papert and Turkle[-@papert_epistemological_1990] addresses on diversity in coding approaches to counter potentially alienating abstract approaches. The authors describe an alternative approach to the dominant formal, abstract style that "emphasizes control through structure and planning" [-@papert_epistemological_1990, p.134]. This dominant approach can be characterised by the following: a top-down design process involving extensive planning prior to coding, explicit teaching of language principles and syntax, and coding from scratch rather than altering existing products. To counter this dominance, Papert and Turkle highlighted the value of a more concrete computing pedagogy, likening the process to bricolage, a craft-based approach where participants become very familiar with their tools and materials. Bricolage approaches involve an iterative process, proximity to the code, strong links between function and form, and maintaining close contact with a concrete sense of the outcomes, even at the expense of programming efficiency or neatness of code.

Techniques which facilitated concrete approaches include the use of tangible physical and digital objects, particularly those which could be shared within communities.


#### Microworlds as both toolset and pedagogy

Laurillard [-@laurillard2020significance] describes constructionism as a distinctive pedagogy based on Papert’s vision of a publicly shareable project based a carefully scaffolded code environments (called microworlds), designed to foreground specific concepts. Microworlds can facilitate the exploration of diverse concepts [@rieber_microworlds_2004]. Microworlds are simplified computer simulations or models that were conceived as controlled environments in which students can explore and experiment with maths or physics concepts in a concrete way [@harel_constructionism_1991; @papert_mindstorms_1980].  Guzdial [-@kong_providing_2022] continues the ethos of microworlds using a concept called of task specific programming language to limit the complexity of code  for the tasks or concept explorations compared to a complete programming language.

However, the use of microworlds in traditional school settings is not unproblematic. Hoyles [-@hoyles_microworldsschoolworlds_1993] too there is a danger that the potential is 'trivialised' into a vehicle for instruction based processes aimed narrowed to teacher chosen curricular concepts. Papert [-@papert_turtles_2002, p.17] also cautions against an institutional dilution which can threaten their potential to retain qualities as "exploratory, playful, personally meaningful".



#### Constructionist design heuristics


Most relevant to the domain of this study are constructionist design principles articulated by Resnick and Rosenbaum [-@resnick_designing_2013] in the form of designing for tinkerability in terms of allowing immediate feedback and fluid experimentation and open experimentation. Resnick advocates for choosing black boxes carefully to abstract away complexity for the learner when it is not productive. This principle of simplifying the environment with an aim to allow learners can get started easily is given a metaphor of low floors. Other principles include high ceilings reflecting a need that projects are not limited in terms of complexity that can be achieved with effort and wide walls to represent the advantage of creations being able to create a diversity of genres of projects [@resnick_reflections_2005, @resnick_scratch:_2009].

##### Scratch as a more general toolset, remixing, and community elements

One area of scaffolding is in the provision of a library of assets.

One concept advanced to address this in constructionist research is that of a Constructopedia [@papert_technological_1995], an encyclopedia of design elements and resources to implement acting as bother a practical resources and source inspiration. While instances have come and gone [@nichols2007idea] none remain an idea perhaps limited by the broadness of its scope.

Instead, the promise is present in a different form is in the online community of the Scratch tool created by constructionist research as a product of MIT media lab.

**Scratch and remixing**

Scratch is a general purpose multi-media production too which has been used in many CGD&P research programmes and in general practice. It exemplifies of the design heuristics of constructionism, in particular the wide-walls

All created products on the online community are remixable by others.

However, the remixing of  Scratch projects is complicated by the an embedded nature of the features. The process of extracting them and implementing them is neither straightforward or guided.

<!--
THIS IS IS FROM

Low floors: a tool that is intuitive enough to allow new users to acclimate to it gradually and with a degree of confidence.
High ceilings: a tool that also allows more experienced users to create constructs (in this case, video games) that can grow increasingly complex and nuanced as one’s own proficiency increases.
Wide walls: a tool that—in addition to low floors and high ceilings—allows its users to create a wide range a constructs, letting users tap into elements of personal experience as well as popular culture to design and develop something entirely unique and representative of their own interests and backgrounds.
We added a fourth principle to emphasize the equally important social dimension of construction tools:11

Open windows: a tool to facilitate the sharing of digital media. The creation of digital communities represents the new frontier in terms of making computer programming a more accessible skill for youths. -->

<!-- Denner and colleagues' review of this area, using the term CGD&P rather than constructionist gaming, uses a broad categorisation of pedagogies used in studies . -->



<!-- Look the potential of at constructopedia samplers
[@papert_technological_1995], an attempt using the computer clubhouse to make this happen using the potential of the internet [@chapman_pearls_2006]. -->




#### Coding clubhouses and cultural programmes

Constructionist research is often carried out in community settings [@resnick_computer_1996], a key example being the first Computer Clubhouse, an after school club in a Boston's computer museum [@resnick_computer_1998;  @peppler_computer_2009]. Constructionism's founder Papert [-@papert_mindstorms:_1980] was influenced by his observational research on community organising within Samba schools as form of mutual learning environments describing "settings that are real, socially cohesive, and where experts and novices are all learning". Bruckman [@bruckman_community_1998, p 51-52] notes the importance of a _constructionist culture_ to support experimental processes enabled by technological tools. Bruckman and Zagal, fellow MIT researchers, formally compared the cultural learning components of a Samba school [@zagal_samba_2005] and to activity to a Computer clubhouse. To do this Bruckman and Zagal draw on the socio-cultural concept of communities of practice [@lave_situating_1991] to describe social practices including the importance of showcase events share created work, flexibility of ways of participating, and the value of diversity within the skill levels and backgrounds of participants.

<!-- There is limited research on how to create learning communities making games for educational purposes. Existing research [@xiao_fostering_2007] has close parallels with project approaches and has a focus on fostering online collaboration and resources sharing. Many popular and well researched online communities exist [scratch, itch.io, new grounds](Bruckman).  -->

<!-- Correa (2015), explores the role of children as brokers of technology in family environments. MOVE LATER? WITHIN 5D? BARRON?  -->

<!-- In response to the limitations of accessibility of online participatory culture  [@roque_family_2016]  CHECK THIS AND SAY HOW,  -->

MIT researcher Roque in the Family Creative Learning (FCL) program brought family members are brought directly into the making process to help overcome barriers to computer coding [@roque_family_2016]. Roque [@roque2016family] draws on both  constructionist and socio-cultural ideas to design a creative making programme via face-to-face sessions using Scratch and playful physical processes and materials. The work utilises the work of Barron and colleagues [-@barron_parents_2009] on parental roles in a making environment in the way facilitators were guided to help develop parents and children develop participation in community activities [@roque_becoming_2018]. Barron et al. [-@barron_parents_2009] identified social and cultural behaviours of parents in settings of informal technology uses. The authors coalesced these behaviours into roles, the most notable being teacher, project collaborator, learning broker, non-technical consultant and learner. FCL draws on the underlying  sociocultural approaches within Barron and colleagues' foundational work. Roque makes a convincing case for the value of exploring the collaborative roles of parents and facilitators and of creating social, collaborative and reflective activities to complement the more technological aspects of the making activities. The research team created a detailed guide to replicate the programme [@leggett_family_2017].


<!-- In the following literature review sections I will examine sociocultural approaches and concepts that may be used in wider contexts but also applicable to CGD&P. -->

<!-- To compare with learning in more formal structured, and more naturalistic learning environments, it best matches a more optimal approach to game making with families. -->

<!-- However, while the design of the FCL programme was effective to build parental confidence and to increase overall accessibility to the process , it left questions unanswered about the effectiveness of the process to enable further learning at home after the programme end. In addition, similar to the computer clubhouse model, it is noteable that there are potential difficulties of scaling this hybrid approach (FCL) in terms of the expert facilitator help needed. -->


#### Constructionist framing of relevant learning outcomes - computational thinking and dimensions of fluency and agency

**Computational thinking (CT)**

Tedre and Denning's [-@tedre_long_2016] caution against newer definitions of CT that highlight formal abstractions typified by Wing's take on CT [-@wing_computational_2008] to the detriment of Papert's applied understandings of computational thinking. A distinction between concrete and abstract approaches is helpful to examine the differences between these two interpretations of computational thinking (CT) within in the field of computing education. Jeanette Wing' influential take on CT focusing on varied elements of abstraction processes [@wing2011research] has adopted by numerous learning resources aimed at teachers which present four key pillars of CT, specifically: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithmic thinking [@bbc_bitesize_introduction_nodate; @dong_prada_2019]. The implication is that there is a value to understand the underlying principles as separate from the context of coding to better apply then in areas beyond computing. This rationale of broader applicability was used by many computer science educators to advocate for the CS to be mainstreamed into education. [FIND SOURCE]

<!-- was developed in response to a thought experiment "How do we describe what Tim, Shannon, and Renita are learning as they participate as designers of interactive media with Scratch?".  -->

Constructionist researchers Brennan and Resnick [-@brennan_new_2012] addressed the and the limited approach of the newer definition of computational thinking [@cuny_demystifying_2010] by taking a grounded / situated approach create a map of the potential learning dimensions of students designing and coding collaborative, creative computing projects. The resulting description of computational thinking includes computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives, thus reconnecting with Papert's vision of the potential of computing projects within a community setting. Lye's extensive review of teaching Computational Thinking [@lye_review_2014] used Resnick and Brennan's definition as the basis for the review, indicating the widespread use of this more applied approach involving the more concrete code concepts (e.g. loops, conditionals, and sequences) and practices (e.g. debugging, iterative practice, reusing and remixing).

<!-- IS A TABLE USEFUL HERE? OR GLOSSARY ELEMENTS -->

<!-- As such, from the perspectives of critics of Wings abstract framing of computational thinking [@denning_remaining_2017], the uptake of the more applied definition can be seen as beneficial (to who? to do what?) -->

**Fluency and agency as relevant learner outcomes**

The greater role of community is reflected third category of computational perspectives, including: expressing (creating project which allow self-expression within a community of peers), connecting and questioning (involving critical approach to technology). This strand of the framework builds on a previous focus by Papert and Resnick [@papert_technological_1995] on the learning outcome of technology fluency. Fluency as an attribute is present in several strands of constructionist research described in different contexts as technical fluency [@papert_technological_1995], digital fluency [@resnick_scratch_2009], gaming fluency [@a_peppler_gaming_2009; @kafai201221] or computational fluency [@resnick_computational_2018]. While this literature describes a similar blend of technical skills and the importance of self-expression within a community of peers in broad terms, it lacks a conceptual underpinning drawing on theoretical frameworks.

One exception is the work of Kafai and colleagues on collective agency [@kafai_learning_2008] or later collaborative agency [@kafai_collaborative_2011; @kafai2012collaborative] to examine collective work in after school computer clubs and the online scratch community. The researchers cite the frameworks of communities of practice [@wenger_communities_1998] and agency formation in during collaborative knowledge production [@scardamalia_higher_1991-1]. While the researchers use these broad concepts to describe manifestations of collaborative agency as learners distribute responsibilities as they create collaborative projects, their discussion of the process in relation to the underlying theory is brief and focused on general online collaboration in the Scratch community. Kafai later work on review of game making does not return to these promising strand of theoretically grounded exploration of agency.   

<!-- An additional limitation in constructionism approach to digital making in varied forms is lack of of an underlying consistency in terminology regarding the motivation for undertaking the work. -->


#### Constructionist pedagogies - Project-based rather than instruction-based

When pedagogy is addressed in recent constructionist studies, it often takes the form of broad principles of design thinking or general project-based approaches [@resnick_scratched_2012; @resnick_lifelong_2017]. A later section addresses these pedagogies in more detail.

Addressing broad approaches, Kafai has emphasised the importance of a situated and critical approach to coding practices [@kafai_revaluation_2022; @kafai_theory_2020]. However, this work remains broad, and specifics on pedagogical scaffolding are still lacking.


#### Limitations within constructionist approaches and the related field of CGD&P research

There is a potential gap in constructionist research regarding pedagogical approaches. Research on constructionism as an educational approach has increasingly centred on the design affordances of researcher-created toolkits and communities that facilitate personal understandings of knowledge  [@vossoughi_making_2016].

Vossoughi's [-@vossoughi_making_2016] critique of constructionism from a socio-cultural and egalitarian perspective highlights this absence of _intentional forms of pedagogy_. She attributes this gap to a focus on tools rather than on sociocultural contexts and the development of social relationships as part of the making process.

In some ways ironic given the critique from constructionist researchers of approaches which focusing too narrowly on technical approaches and toolsets rather than their expressive potential (and thus within a community)  and focused on toolsets rather than pedagogies withing digital making in general [@resnick_seeds_2020; @resnick_coding_2020], and game making more specifically []
FIND KAFAI QUOTEIn even in Kafai's review of CGD&P, specific pedagogies were lacking.

<!-- ALSO ADDRESSING BROADER LIMITATIONS WITHIN THE FIELD OF CGD&P -->

It raises a question why, given this perspective are underpinning pedagogies lacking. I propose that this deficit may be due to a deficit in analytical processes and theoretical concepts particularly visible within concepts of agency development, and mediational strategies. It follows that these limitation of constructionism are also present in the research landscape of CGD&P which has been significantly guided by it.  

This relates to the primary research question of this thesis. And brings us to the next section.  

<!-- but notes that ‘theoretical underpinnings of constructionism are difficult to pin down in most of its literature’ [@laurillard2020significance, p.29] -->

<!-- This more concrete interpretation of CT, based on observation of learners in action, is more accessible to teachers and learners as they can more easily recognise their own practice than in the more abstract interpretations of CT. To give a specific example, rather than decomposition, the applied framework outlines taking an iterative, incremental approach to problem solving and arranging code in modules. -->
<!-- This broader, process driven definition of CT has been used and adapted by many organisations seeking to support the new computing curriculum may be familiar from websites, posters and other supporting material created by groups like Barefoot computing.  -->
<!-- The review above and the influential framework used by Computing at School [@csizmadia_computational_2015-1]  have included elements of this applied framework as well as other more abstract CT concepts. -->
<!-- This is not to argue that Wing's approach to CT is without technical merit [@lodi_computational_2021], rather that its adoption by educational bodies like CAS in the UK and similar bodies internationally has risks. The inclusion of formal CT frameworks in curriculum and formal testing has provoked mechanistic teaching of decontextualised concepts via formal teaching methods to the detriment of hands-on exploration and creation of personally meaningful projects [@resnick_coding_2020]. -->
<!-- In a challenge to this article Wilensky [-@wilensky1991abstract] questions the nature of abstract in this context arguing that all objects and concepts are abstract until familiarity makes them more concrete to the user. -->



<!--
In their review and a critique constructionist approaches to game making, Thumlert et al agree with the potential of a constructionist approach to develop 21st century skills, -->

<!-- It is important, in the interests of balance, to separate out some of the positives from the limits here. The school has done good work (tools, design principles) that can be built on. -->


<!-- A key advantage of viewing the domain from a contextual point of view is allowing a more nuanced exploration of the motivations for participating or not participating in game making. There is a danger that lack of participation in computer science can be viewed from a deficit perspective, e.g. what skills or confidence to students lack. Studies from a sociocultural perspective allow for a deeper exploration of interests, values, and practices from outside of the immediate learning environment. -->

#### Explicit teaching of computational thinking - Principles first

<!-- NOTE KEEP THIS BRIEF -  -->

Wing's emphasis on the importance of the explicit teaching of skills of decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking, contribution on computational thinking is  more theoretical than applied and invites discussion on how best to teach this abstract approach to computation thinking. Grover [@grover_computational_2017; @grover_computational_2013] and Guzdial [@guzdial_learner-centered_2015] offer explicit techniques linked using the application of computer programming as the driving mechanism. Bell and colleagues [@bell2019constructing] explore the process of unplugged activities, exploring abstract CT concepts without using computers or coding. Other research explores the challenges teaching of computational thinking principles in subjects other than computing [@dong_prada_2019].

While the remit of this literature review does not encompass a full critique of the validity Wing's strand of computational thinking either within computer science or other subject (see the following for an overview [@denning_remaining_2017]), what these approaches have in common is a principles first approach to problem solving. While the concept of understanding foundational concepts before engaging with the practice seems logical, in practice when dealing with obtuse material it can aggravate barriers to participation such as those outlined in Chapter 1. Thus, the following sections of this review of pedagogies relevant to the concerns of this study primarily focus on practices which lead with forms of concrete exploration rather than a principles first approach.


### Design frameworks using stages & project based learning (PBL)


As identified by they systemic review of CGD&P [@denner_does_2019], the design-built-test pedagogy is common in this field found in 30 out of 68 studies. The examplar given in this review highlights the approach of Globaloria programme which structures project work around an iterative cycle of stages of play, plan, prototype, program, publish. Many similar frameworks exist in diverse areas of production including computer science [@pereira_design_2018], engineering [@winarno_steps_2020-1], and design [@dam_5_2024]. Figure 2.x shows a graphical representation of design thinking stages from the Institute of Design at Stanford dschool [@dam_5_2024].

![Figure 2.x. Design thinking via design stages model from Stanford dschool](./Pictures/designthinkingchart_orig.png){width=90%}

<!-- One stream in CS stems from engineering and design thinking [@resnick_all_2007; @winarno_steps_2020-1]. -->

Within the context of computing edcuation Resnick [-@resnick_scratched_2012] describes the foundations of the design-based approaches in education as; engaging in design activities, exploring personally meaningful topics, collaborating with others, and deepening understanding through reflection. Reviewing these characteristics, a similarity can be seen with the field of project based and discovery based learning.




<!-- To illustrate this design-based approach Resnick advocates a _creative cycle model_ [@resnick_lifelong_2017]. The five circular stages are; Imagine, Create, Play, Share, Reflect and returning to Imagine once more.  -->

<!-- While the value of design thinking stages for educators planning sessions seems clear, and elements of this framework are included in early literature to help adoption of new computing curriculum in UK [@csizmadia_computational_2015],  there is little research exploring how the stages could be used by learners to scaffold their own design process when engaging in making digital products. -->

<!-- Resnick and Brennan [@mouza_imagining_2013] focus on the affordances of tools and communities to support all aspects of students work on design stages without suggesting any processes from a teacher of student perspective. -->

<!-- One exception is the work of Zainal et al [@zainal_review_2021], using the Stanford dschool design thinking framework [@dam_5_2024] to structure the work on students in undertaking IoT project work.
The authors, note the lack of research investigating the  potential of this approach and call for more work to be done in this area.
ADD TO THE PROBLEMS STATEMENT.  BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS TRUE  -->


<!-- Thus, while the ethos and benefits of this approach are convincing RESNICK'S TAKE, what is not clear however is who this framework is for (either for designers, facilitators or participants) or how it can be activated in the process of facilitating project work.   -->

<!--
The model is similar to the ADDIE model from instructional system design: Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation and Evaluation. The discipline of teaching engineering also has a similar design stage cycle with many contesting variations [@winarno_steps_2020]. Engineering is Elementary project adapted from the ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) guidelines [@syukri_impact_2018] involves the following steps; Ask, Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share [@hester_engineering_2007]. It has been adopted by the area of computing is one used in a recent book on coding by Bers [@bers_coding_2021]. HOW IS THIS USED? AS A PEDAGOGY? -->


#### Project-based learning (PBL)

<!-- As outlined in the introduction, this thesis, while guided by constructionism as a design approach, uses AT as a theoretical framework.
In addition, this section outlines the value of PBL as a more developed framework as well. -->

<!-- There is a clear alignment between the potential of making games and other media products as an educational activity and the agenda o f project-based learning, particularly in the to develop skills suited to the modern workplace (21st Century skills).  -->

<!-- The following section explores relevant elements of PBL pedagogies, where possible making alignments with existing game making studies.  -->

The field of project based learning (PBL) provides a wide scope of research detailing pedagogical approaches aligned with the focus on social learning research of this thesis. PBL approaches align with the iterative design approach outlined above (see Figure 2.x) [@jia2023design] and can extend the processes and rationale involved through drawing on research grounded on sociocultural understanding of learning. In broad terms, PBL is an educational strategy which advocates: learner choice in projects which increases motivation [@darling-hammond_powerful_2008]; authentic and shareable project outcomes and learning environments to encourage peer feedback and reflection [@gibbes_project-based_2014; @hung_activity_2000];  iterative projects work supporting student mastery; and challenging goals and guidance in goal setting aiding self-regulation in learners [@barron_doing_1998; @hernandez_aalborg_2015].

<!--
To align with the focus of this study I will focus on the following dimensions of PBL:

- driving questions / challenge - involving chi
- facilitation of group creativity
- authenticity of processes
 -->


Significant challenges exist in undertaking PBL including: expertise and confidence in facilitation [@ertmer_essentials_2015-1], and practicalities of timetabling and time pressures within formal settings.

Perhaps because PBL requires learning environment and activities that allow for an active construction of knowledge by learners rather than one dominated by instruction [@kokotsaki_project-based_2016], PBL is often conflate it with unstructured, _pure-discovery_ approaches [@kirschner_why_2006; @hmelo-silver_scaffolding_2007]. However, while there is unified structural approach to scaffolding, contextually responsive support is a vital component of PBL. Project based learning often involve challenges to students which are framed as wicked problems, which in some ways are unsolvable in that their dynamic and complex nature mean they require regular revisiting to find updated, contextually appropriate approaches. Similarly, the process of providing  relevant scaffolding to support PBL is also a such a wicked problem, requiring new approaches as background context and use of novel tools. As such, while finding an existing scaffolding structure to base my learning design on for this study may not be optimal, general principles to structure a project based approach are relevant.



Procedural forms of scaffolding which facilitators can adopt, including those to aid group work, support reflection, and to structure knowledge sharing via project outcomes [@ertmer_essentials_2015-1; @pitot_establishing_2024]. EXAMPLES?

In Ertmer Hard and soft forms of scaffolding - relevant here, some structural, some relational. Link to microworlds.

Kolodoner research too [@kolodner_problem-based_2003] - on building culture of collaborating and supporting development of rituals.
Although this research based on constructivism, and stems from scenario based computer modelling of cognition [@kolodner_case-based_2004], it is strongly aligned  sociocultural concepts.


Leat [-@leat_enquiry_2017-1] in an analysis of schools-based PBL using a sociocultural lens notes and highlights the value of incorporating what Moll [-@moll_funds_1992] refers to as funds of knowledge, resources which learners can draw on in either formal or informal settings [^2]. However the process of undertaking the incorporation of such funds can be challenging for both teachers who may lack relevant knowledge and for the relevant communities who may lack capacity [@gonzalez_funds_2005]. Leat [-@leat_enquiry_2017-1] notes the value of activity theory as a sociocultural process to analyse such tensions in ecological context of learning.

<!-- The Aalborg PBL model at higher education level [@hernandez_aalborg_2015] -->


An additional form of of PBL scaffolding, the restriction of choice of participants to reduce the possibilities for learners being overwhelmed, can expose a tension in relation to the value of student choice over project work [@ertmer_essentials_2015-1].


Due to the difficulty of generalising and abstracting frameworks linked to domain specific knowledge and processes, a gap exists in PBL literature regarding kind of scaffolding that might support the develop CGD&P more specifically.

**PERHAPS DROP THIS BIT?**

It is relevant to ask what exists structuring PBL in game making.

Code gaming suits a project based learning (PBL) approach in that it provides an readily understandable driving question which can be shared publicly via a playable game to an authentic audience, either in person or online.

Returning to the example of Globaloria [], researcher found the structuring provided helpful to challenge the perception of limitations of a discovery approach.

One of the sources for sustained engagement is when, as part of the iterative process, learners are able to test and then revise their creation or experiment based on their own evaluation.

Games as a project outcome provide the potential for an authentic project with a real audience for creations, as a source of inspiration and as peer evaluators in the testing process.


<!-- In addition, the range of applications and situated nature of the learning via PBL creates significant challenges in representation of practice, including communicating specific details of scaffolding used. -->

<!-- In formal education, contextual factors hinder the adoption of PBL challenge creative approaches in general. These include challenges of teaching to an exam-based curriculum, time allocated and other timetabling factors. While these are less applicable to informal settings,  -->
<!-- This alignment of approach also extends to some of the limits of PBL approach. The critique of PBL as 'pure discovery' learning is often misjudged, missing some of the less visible scaffolds often in place to support learner to access learning, and to reflect on learning that has taken place. -->

<!-- PBL can be effective in diverse fields of practice including: inclusive pedagogies [@leggett_impact_2021], and the use of appropriate "learning scaffolds" [@kokotsaki_project-based_2016, p. 8], language learning [@gibbes_project-based_2014], and digital making [@weng_characterizing_2022].   -->


<!-- It is of value to examine PBL literature detailing structure and pedagogical approaches in the area of digital product production and language learning. -->

<!-- Research in the area of digital media production using a PBL methodology exists

Gibbes et al's review of PBL in language learning from an activity theory perspective provides good foundational material for this study [@gibbes_project-based_2014]. -->


<!-- Given then broad benefits of PBL to make media, and returning to the claims around Kafai on constructionist games, it invites the question, is there anything particularly special about the use of games as a project? -->
<!-- **Returning to developing Computational Fluency**
PERHAPS NOT - MORE OF A BRIDGE TO NEXT SECTION PERHAPS

To refocus this review, let's return to focus of computational fluency as the focus for one of the research questions. Why choose this concept rather that broader 21 Century skills? -->

<!-- Elements of this framework are included in early literature to help adoption of new computing curriculum in UK [@csizmadia_computational_2015]. However little guidance is provide and not stream really followed up unlike the focus on computational thinking [@sentance_teachers_2015] -->


<!-- A wider review of design framework in STEM settings details discussion of varied definitions of stages themselves but less relating to the impact of the pedagogical use of design stages on learners [@winarno_steps_2020-1]. -->



### Use Modify Create

The 'Use-Modify-Create' approach proposed by Lee and colleagues [-@lee_computational_2011] is particularly promising to counter issue of user anxiety and demotivation surrounding the difficulty of coding games. UMC evolved from research involving the use of game making and robotics to support computational thinking [@denner_computer_2012; @denner_using_2014; @werner_pair_2013; @werner_children_2014]. The model advocates the remixing of existing games to act as a scaffold to build the competence of the beginner coder. Learners are guided to progress in the complexity of their modifications, thus becoming increasing proficient in the recognition and use of computational concepts and structures [-@lee_computational_2011]

In the _Use_ stage, coders build a familiarity with coding interfaces, code structures and syntax through scaffolded approaches which involve interacting with the program code and what it produces. In the _Modify_ stage learners progress to working on real projects created by others. Learners deepen their knowledge of coding structures and practices by altering existing projects and templates to suit their own aims. _Create:_ After novice coders become more familiar with patterns of code design in use in the modify stage, they can progress to replicate such patterns in other code that they create from scratch.

A study involving five hundred 9 to 14 year-olds found that the UMC approach can balance a structured approach with more student-led exploration [@franklin_analysis_2020]. The researchers also found that the students enjoyed the UMC approach as they had more choice and agency in the process. This is supported by other research which compared UMC with a starting-from-scratch approach and found higher student engagement for those in the UMC group [@lytle_use_2019]. The researchers found that because students using UMC had more time to play around with code, they were able to add their own personal touches and that this ownership over the code sustained their continued engagement. While the scope of the study is limited, observations support motivation of UMC that this pattern of creation maintains higher level of engagement through reducing technical barriers to participation, and affording greater sense of learner's ownership over end project through greater choice over the final outcome.

**Research on UMC which develops learner choice**

<!-- NOTE - This may be moved to design chapter -->


Giving learners agency via their choice over the design of created public code products has the potential to motivate ad sustain programming activity [@papert_mindstorms_1980; @kafai_constructionism_1996], but brings with it the potential for both facilitator stress in supporting diverse activity, and the potential for diversion for students away from target areas of subject exploration (a tension Noss and Hoyles call the play paradox [@hoyles_pedagogy_1992])

Addressing these tensions work by Franklin and friends suggest the use of the UMC framework [@franklin_analysis_2020].

Other work from UMC proponent Lytle suggests a list of extensions to choose from, swapping create for choose [@lytle_use_2019-1]. Based partly on the cause of teacher stress caused by the open ended nature of the "Create" part of the model.   


UMC has been developed to be end with scaffolded set of choices.
In a study where students use a block based language to develop simulations - the authors note limits of study but are enthusiastic about providing a limited set of choices for final exploration within a limited time frame [@lytle_use_2019-1; @lytle_use_2019]

- Scaffold Students and Teachers- Providing the necessary programming blocks students need to complete a choice
- Differentiate Choices by Difficulty - create choice systems that have varying difficulty
- Create Choices that Show Visible and Immediate Changes
- Make things Complex, not Complicated
- Draw from Student Desires - students will engage more with the material, feeling like the creations are their own.

<!--
  - Scaffold Students and Teachers- Providing the necessary pro-gramming blocks students need to complete a choice ala a Par-son’s Problem greatly reduces cognitive load, especially in activitieswhere lots of choices means lots of blocks. Similarly, giving teachers a “Cheat Sheet" of answers for each choice, scaffolds their abilityto act as a facilitator and debugger.

  Differentiate Choices by Difficulty- This time, challenge came from adding morec hoices, but each choice was relatively the samedifficulty. In the future, we wish to create choice systems that havevarying difficulty to give targeted tasks for each student skill level.

- Create Choices that Show Visible Change
  - Prioritize choicesthat produce immediate changes in the run of the simulation (e.g. anew animal appearing in the environment).Create Choices that Promote Content Inquiry- Our decisionto primarily focus on adding more animals came from the fact thateach new animal made the Food Web more complex.

  - Make things Complex, not Complicated- As demonstrated in Figure 2, each animal had relatively the same set of code blocks. In this way, a lot of choices were available without adding many additional necessary blocks for students.

- Draw from Student Desires- Some of the choice ideas (e.g. bear)came from responses from students in the ‘Fox-Only’ -->



### Half-baked games

The use of half-baked (incomplete) games draws on the approaches of as Microworlds and UMC stages using games as starting products [@kynigos_half-baked_2007]. This concept of builds on Papert's concept of _microworlds_, simplified computer simulations or models that were conceived as controlled environments in which students can explore and experiment with maths or physics concepts in a concrete way [@harel_constructionism_1991; @papert_mindstorms_1980].


'Half-baked' games, a term proposed by Kynigos and colleagues [@kynigos_half-baked_2007; @kynigos_children_2018], are unfinished and deficient in a way which motivates learners to alter the design or code and improve it. Half-baked games should be designed to encourage malleability in directions that the learner may find interesting [@kynigos_children_2018]. To do this the original game designer makes complex decisions which highlight certain affordances of the game in a way which encourages the exploration of key concepts. Here the concept of affordances is to express the delegated intention of designers to create features for users that encourage certain desired behaviours [@mcgrenere_affordances_2000]. In a key study [@kynigos_children_2018, p.2], the researched provided "tools affording them (13-15 year olds) with the role of game hackers" to alter existing game code. While Kynigos' design promoted the acquisition of computational thinking for participants. Kynigos and Yiannoutsou identify a progression in the type of CT skills being used as the processing of modifying the game progresses as part of the Use-Modify-Create model: specifically a progression from elements including pattern recognition associated with reading of code to more advanced examples including creating abstracted structures and sequencing their own algorithms. Kynigos also highlights the possibilities of half-baked artefacts to build learner dialogue around the problems at hand as as 'a communicational tool to shape a common language within the community' [@kynigos_half-baked_2007, p. 336.

#### Levels of Abstraction

<!-- The term abstraction has varied interpretation even within the field of computer science education [@hazzan_reducing_2002].   -->

In teaching computing pedagogy the concept of levels of abstraction can facilitate both teachers and students to help them understand the level of abstraction that they are working at [@statter_teaching_2016; @waite_abstraction_2016; @waite_abstraction_2018]. While the term abstraction has varied interpretations within the field of computer science [@hazzan_reducing_2002], here it reflects a spectrum between overarching concepts and the concrete results (see Table 2.x).

<!-- To quickly review LOA, the levels are Problem, Design, Code, Running the Code. And the purpose is, "Levels of abstraction has been interpreted as a hierarchy to enable teachers and learners to describe which level they are working at, rather than as a methodology for programming projects."[@waite_abstraction_2018] -->


| **Level**            | **Focus** | **Example** |
|----------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Conceptual Level**  | Thinking about the problem **without programming** | Task -  what is needed |
| **Design Level**  | Structuring / designing a solution | What it should do. |
| **Code Level**  | Writing the actual code  | How it is done |
| **Execution Level**  | Understanding how the computer processes the code on a low-level (e.g memory use), or in a k5 context the outputs | What it does. |

Table. 2.x Breakdown or Table of levels of abstraction. [@waite_abstraction_2018]


<!-- their approach to abstraction [@waite_abstraction_2018-1] is distinct from Wing's in that it is grounded in an operationalised computational model distinguishing levels of abstraction: specifically, in descending order of abstraction, the goal or problem to be solved, the designed structure of the program, the actual coding of that design, and at the most concrete level, the running of the code and its outputs [@waite_abstraction_2018-1] (see Table 7.1). Wing's CT concepts within the LOA model would lie at the design level.  -->

Guided by research indicating potential efficacy in supporting learning programming practices [@cutts2012abstraction; @statter_teaching_2016], Waite and colleagues investigated the utility of awareness of abstraction, to primary school aged learners [@waite_abstraction_2016]. While the process initially lacked a guiding pedagogy, the authors saw potential in movement between the levels as a form of self regulation and more specifically activity the design level facilitating realistic judgement concerning code implementation given the time and ability of the novice coders [@waite_abstraction_2018].

<!-- In conclusion, the authors [-@waite_abstraction_2018-1, p.21] also state that the overall utility of LOA as a useful tool for younger participants is an open question, and that more research is needed on claims that it can help "use of design as a self-regulation tool to develop independence". -->

<!-- This work highlights the potential role of alternating between abstract and concrete concepts in semantic waves aimed at helping teachers design learning experiences which in part allow for participant shifts in LOA perspectives. -->

#### Semantic Profiles and PRIMM

Later work by Waite and Sentance [@sentance_primm_2017] combines LOA with a concept of semantic profiles [@macnaught_jointly_2013] to create an applied pedagogy (PRIMM) for computing education. Semantic profiles chart the use of more concrete (high semantic gravity) language and more abstract (high semantic density) concepts and patterns as they emerge in classroom situations [@macnaught_jointly_2013].

![Figure 2.x - A semantic profile in wave form](./Pictures/ch_2_sw_dia_1.png){width=75%}


Research carried out by Curzon and colleagues [-@curzon_using_2020] in a computing education context outlines the value of semantic profiles in wave shape as opposed to a flatline which remains too much in concrete examples or more abstract concepts. This research highlights the value of unpacking, exploring and then repacking ideas during the course of a lesson. A student's understanding of a concept may deepen a little bit each time it is applied in practice and then reconnected with the abstract.

<!-- Introduction to semantic waves.  
[@maton_making_2013] -->
<!-- start with activities that allow the use of more concrete (high semantic gravity) language and then explore more abstract (high semantic density) concepts and patterns as they emerge in these authentic situations. -->

<!-- Examples showing semantic wave profiles usually start with the process beginning with the abstract or with high semantic density. See Figure 1.1 for an example. The advice of starting with more abstract terminology and concepts may seem to be in opposition to the approach of Concreteness Fading as explained with the CRA method outlined above. However, on examination of the research example carried out in the research above, the process of starting with concepts may only involve giving a short outline of the concept that is being explored and saying that this will be illustrated in a following concrete activity. -->

##### PRIMM

<!-- **PRIMM uses concepts of semantic profile to try to align instruction based approaches with a sociocultural approach (or at least some hands-on approaches)** -->

In proposing PRIMM Sentence et al highlights a debate in this field of a proposed deficit of exploration based, constructionism approaches by Grover [-@sentance_teaching_2019, p. 5], proposing greater instruction and guidance. To address this without fully embracing an instruction, expert-led approach, the author propose PRIMM model, signifying Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify and Make.

Thus, PRIMM extends the UMC model, Modify, adding three stages to the start. Learners are presented with a providing a concrete code example and predicting what it will do, checking the results against they running it. With guidance learners investigate possible changes that can be made to the code before modifying it. The final, Make stage (as with Create in UMC) suggests students creating programs or larger elements of code structures from scratch.

GIVE AN EXAMPLE? AND USE SEMANTIC PROFILE TOO

By starting with predicting based on existing code,  student start with the concrete code and then be.
However, PRIMM not explored via semantic profiles.



PRIMM has been developed with the the computing classroom in mind, drawing on concepts such as
differentiation to make concepts _accessible by all learners in a class_. Prediction of a code allows a whole class of learners to unpack and repack the  key computational concepts or process.


**Data from research, response of teachers , application and take up of SW and PRIMM**


Exploring semantic profiles is being promoted by NCCE  an aid to teachers wanting to plan their lessons in a way that communicates the key abstract curriculum knowledge that students will need for exams, and to also allow them to put the concepts into practice to build real coding skills and to make valuable connections to personal experience. .[^2]

<!-- The middle ground PRIMM aims for between instruction and free experimentation may align well with non-formal approaches in non-classroom settings. -->

<!-- PERHAPS IN SYNTHESIS - MOVE?

**Limitations of LOA and PRIMM and more work?**

<!-- Certainly, the difficultly in explicitly teaching abstraction rather than implicit approaches of appropriation [@kramer_abstraction_2003], while contested by  [@statter_teaching_2016], and based on work of Hazzan [-@hazzan_reflections_2008], underlying concerns are not fully addressed.
CLARIFY THIS WHOLE SECTION - OR DROP OR MOVE?  -->


PRIMM is built on an underlying premise that explicit teaching of abstract concepts or processes complements concrete exploration within programming activities [@sentance_teachers_2019]. However, research lacks data on the process of such explicitly teaching or what abstract concepts should be best explored via this pedagogy. This may be a practical approach given the different curricular and requirement that teachers face. For example in the UK context there may be an implicit assumption that teachers turn to the computing curriculum for guidance.

Noting recent calls align computing education with sociocultural approaches [@tenenberg_out_2014], the creation of PRIMM by Sentence and colleagues drew on concepts, of mediation and ZPD [-@sentance_teaching_2019, p. 2].
DEVELOP AND COME BACK TO THIS IN THE PROBLEM STATEMENT OF THE THESIS.
The authors acknowledge limits of the research, particularly in the form of differentiation of work and the use of wider concepts of the sociocultural theoretical framework used.

## Social approaches and cultural programmes

This section addresses collaborative pedagogies and social programme.

- promote coding of projects of which games can be apart
- in particular address barriers  to participation
- and focus on in person communities rather than online programmes

To reflect the nature of the research questions and the existing gaps in the research in this domain, the following descriptions are particularly concerned with the development of learner identity and the development of a collaborative culture which foundational for exploratory project-based approaches [@kolodner_problem-based_2003] .

  , and structures of pedagogy used. NO IN EARLIER SECTION


### Pair programming & social/collaborative coding -

One pedagogy relatively well explored in CGD&P research is that of pair and peer programming.

Role of community feedback within playtesting

Pair programming, a common industry practice has recieved attention in educational contexts [@hanks_pair_2011]. Pair Programming groups students in pairs and divide coding two into two roles. One student undertakes hands-on coding while the other is free to think about more the abstract design of the overall program. A benefit of pair programming is to increase coding confidence as students build their experience of the different roles involved in coding. To help novice coders teachers should model and break down the processes involved.

Werner and colleagues [@werner_pair_2009; @denner_computer_2007] investigate pair programming as way to address gender gap and extending research on collaborative problem solving in computer coding.

They cite research challenging the gender aspect of bricolage / abstract duality, but propose a need for more research on programming styles and strategies [@denner_computer_2007] Their own research underlies that while pair programming is an inclusive strategy beneficial to all but in particular to narrow participation gaps due to gender and socio-economic factors [@werner_pair_2009, p.31].


In Denner's research, pair programming involved social learning elements and can model a greater choices for students in they way they solve problems and opportunities to develop identities. The process of building an identity in a community with the help of peers is key to a socio-cultural understanding of how learners pick up coding in a classroom (or other settings).

<!-- A summary of pair programming roles and tips on how teachers can help learners to adopt them in present in a Quick Read document from NCCE.[^6] -->

Werner et al draw on existing research on collaborative   'social reality or joint problem solving space' to scaffold the process of ideation [@omalley_construction_1995] and the role of friendly relations to develops these productive and sustained interactions [@mcdowell_pair_2006].

<!-- PERHAPS SAVE A SLICE OF BRUCKMAN TO END - AFTER THE  FORM OF CODE CLUBS. -->
<!-- FCL worked to expose limits to the online resources and communities. -->


###  Coding clubs:

Drawing on early legacy of the computer clubhouse work by Papert in Boston described above...

Three similar  volunteer based projects started around the 2012-2014  namely,  Code Club, Coder Dojo and Raspberry Jam. They share: a grass roots approach drawing on enthusiasts.

<!-- A large take up of enthusiastic community activity in response to a model encouraging others to organise their own events. But have struggled to maintain the skilled volunteer input imagined at the start of the program (SO what?) -->


They have not been extensively researched.

Research shows that only a small number of code club respondents used the resources provided to support clubs,  are nearly exclusively instructional in design. resources [@aivaloglou_how_2019],
This may indicate that volunteers use a more responsive, less-structured approach.

All three projects have been subsumed into the RPI foundation, which offers the following types of support.

A report on pedagogies from Waite and Sentence [@waite_teaching_2021], focuses on school... but -  input relevant parts here.

Challenges of clubs include the lack of focus of mostly unguided interactions.

To address the challenge of focus, some clubs may follow guided programs or competitions. An example involving game making would be that of like that of Globaloria which offers guidance,

These provide more structured resources and guidance may be linked ot showcase sites or challenges and competitions.

<!-- raising issues of how much it is optimal for support to be concentrated in one organisation.  -->
<!-- Coder dojo network was more grass roots and included a wiki. CHECK THE ARCHIVES.
As a former volunteer, I confess I didn't share my learning resources beyond local network of voluteers onto that wikis. -->




### Game competitions

The role of competitions or challenges to design for an external audience can motivate students [@kafai_what_2012; @kafai_motivating_2014] and may to bridge to worlds of work and expertise outside of the classroom or beyond the bounds of the informal space.

From 2010 to the present day there have been a variety of coordinated online competitions either from entrepreneurial organisations like the Globey award from Globaloria, from foundations (e.g. Games for Change) or from public bodies (e.g. STEM Video Game Design Challenge sponsored by the White House in the US) [@kafai_social_2013]

An example of a challenge which has been researched is that of the Collab challenge as part of the Scratch online communities  community, [@kafai_motivating_2014; @kafai2011collaboration]


Critique of competitions [@thumlert2018learning] is that the values of the competitions are largely embraced uncritically rather than developing and transforming practices of the learning site itself. Also there is a danger of inequality of access explored above.

This is present in a UK context in computing domain via Coolest project which targets Coder Dojos in particular as an audience.

There is a guide provide by research on the Coolest Project which contains case studies [@quinlan_how_2018],
This is referenced in work by Quinlan and Sentance [@quinlan2020ideas]  on entry points.

Beyond this guide, the challenge provides structure in the use of themed categories which guide participation for example in the Coolest Project the themes of 2025 were: Scratch, Games, Web, Mobile apps, Hardware, Advanced  programming, Artificial Intelligence. And
Another format of challenge which also provides support is that of the game jam.



Some game making competitions draw on the wider concept of a game jam to help structure the process of making a game.

### Educational Game Jams

https://gamesforchange.org/studentchallenge/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/G4C-STUDENT-CHALLENGE-GAME-JAM-GUIDE_updated-1-13-25.pdf

Game Jams are an accelerated production methods, like code sprint or Hackathons, they characterise by an accelerated production ethos, creative collaboration and innovation [@arya_international_2013; @gabler2005prototype].  Participants create games individually or in teams in a time-constrained period, typically 24 or 48 hours. While the premise game jams is to promote collaboration, events are inconsistent in their support and scaffolding of collaborative approaches although a frequent feature is the use of playful constraints to accelerate creativity (e.g playful game themes)  [@goddard_playful_2014]. Recent research posits that Game Jams can be profitably used in formal education contexts [@aurava_game_2021]. Team events often take place in physical venues which may be part of a wider global Jams [@arya_international_2013].

An influential source of an education process of jams is the called the Moveable Game Jam (MGJ) and its guide [@games_for_change_get_2017], created by a collective of New York educators and educational foundations [^1]. The jam guide employ playful methods to increase inclusivity of the process.  To address some of the inclusivity concerns of adult game jams format adaptations have been made. MGJ can be applied in a shorter time-frame, emphasises low-cost and both digital and analogue offline game production. It uses loosely structured activities and broad goals allowing for significant learner agency.  The MGJ process communicate fundamentals concepts of game design process to participants. To achieve this there is periodic facilitator checking of participant projects the use of extensive playtesting in the process. MGJ appears to be the one of the first resources to focus on using game elements as a pedagogical approach; space, goal, components, mechanics and rules [@games_for_change_get_2017], one which has been adopted by other game jams and competitions.   

Arya and colleagues [@arya_ggj-next_2019] note the limits of the Moveable Game Jam in terms of small scale in research which outlines the development of a online centrally coordinated approach of the Global Game Jam and a youth programme launched in 2018.


Recently  Global Games Jam Next programme the has partnered with the Game for Change game making competition. Both organisations have updated documentation based on the MGJ ethos, to help educators to run a game jam or to support novice makers take part in competitions.

The techniques include analyse the component parts of games, using non-digital games, the use of playful roles within game making,

<!-- The area of improvisation is underexplored in the game jam context compared to that of music and theatre [@jaffurs_impact_2004-1; @merilainen_game_2020]. -->

### Fifth Dimension interventions & Connected Learning approaches

<!-- COLE AND GUTIERREZ -->

**5th Dimension**

<!-- **WHAT** -->

In this section examines the characteritics and impact a collection of educational partnership called 5th Dimensions (5D) interventions using in a technology rich environment in a non-formal setting, often in after-school settings within lower income communities[@cole_design-based_2016]. Initial iterations, led by Michael Cole a leading a sociocultural researcher, and took place around San Diego University with the support of volunteers, equipment and technical support to design and help deliver a creative series of computer-based playful activities.

<!-- **why** -->

Cole [@cole2009designing] describes the two key motivations driving the 5thD activity as addressing ongoing need for provision of activities in after-school settings and as a vehicle to provide relevant experiences to students to connect their academic learning of child development to real life experience. The choice to use new computer communication technology of games and email addressed both a chance to address reading deficits [@cole2009designing; @cole2014designing], and potential alienation of women and girls from STEM subjects [@cole1987contextual]. The 5D approach  also highlight the importance, the site of research as joint activity with mutual but differing aims, the multi-generational and mutual nature of the learning of participants, the design of the complexities of the pedagogy. These characteristics provoked a the need for a methodology to capture and analyse activity in an ecological and evolutionary way.

<!-- The goal of the 5th D in terms of diversity and inclusion is significant. -->
<!-- **how** -->

The 5D intervention, used a narrative fiction of a 'wizard' with whom young people interacted via email to motivate and orientate young people undertake computer and playful activities that also developed written and computer literacy [@brown_cultural_2008]. The ongoing nature of the project resulted in regular young attenders helping new cohorts of student volunteers understand how the ongoing activity functioned on technical and social levels in away that both develop a sense of expertise for young people and helped develop important understandings of the mutual nature of the learning environment for student helpers [@cole2009designing].
The importance of designing intervention to nurture participants formation of identities in evolving idiocultures became an important aspect of the work[@cole1987contextual].


It is also significant that different formulations and local cultures with settings, in a way which is responsive to the interests and needs of different settings [@valsiner_cultural-historical_2007]. This strand on culture formation was developed further by researcher Kris Gutiérrez who led two 5D interventions, Las Redes [@scott_nixon_digital_2012], and El Pueblo Mágico  [@gutierrez_learning_2019]. In both sites the researchers developed understandings of the value of the multi-lingual cultural environment in how it contributed to the development of site specific culture. In related work Gutiérrez and Digiacomo [-@gutierrez_developing_2008; -@digiacomo_seven_2017] identify the vital role of learning designers to facilitate the use of movement of identity between settings by responsive learning design which allows learners to draw on  funds of knowledge [@moll_funds_1992; @moll1998turning] [^2]

Gutiérrez and colleagues [@gutierrez_learning_2019] also made explicit an implicit design motivation driving 5thD interventions, that they needed to be fun not only to engage students but also to allow a greater expression of competence and agency by drawing on previous expertise of play in other setting. Gutiérrez [@gutierrez_when_2020; @gutierrez2014integrative] has developed the concept of horizontal movement of practice between between sites of learning rather than a vertical top-down transmission model of learning in ways that are discussed in Chapter 3 within the theoretical framework of this thesis.



<!-- In addition these ideas have been incorporated in a the connected learning approach described below.  -->



<!-- roles are created and breathed into life by the facilitator and affordances of the learning design to accelerate an adoption of principles of practice. -->

<!-- The intervention introduced a fictional narrative to create a shared project for the different participants involved to promote a shared understanding of the work via intentional goal setting . -->



#### Connected Learning Programme

Some of the ideas emerging from the 5thD programme were amplified through their incorporation within an approach called connected learning [@ito2013connected], a project to which Kris Gutiérrez contributed.

The Connected Learning Project, spearheaded by Mimi Ito and the Connected Learning Research Network (CLRN) addressed education for the digital age. This work draws on the underlying ethnographic work of Gee and Ito explored in the introduction and  was a product of wider. It proposed principles to help operationalise this broader approach of connected learning and movement between learning spaces.  Learning should be socially embedded (through peers and communities), interest-driven, and oriented toward opportunity (e.g. able to connect to pathways for educational advancement, career success, and civic engagement). The project aims to broaden access to these kinds of learning opportunities, particularly for underserved youth, by leveraging the potential of digital media and fostering connections across different learning environments like home, school, and community.

It's less about a specific curriculum or tool and more about sharing wider principles and case studies showing principles in practice.


However, while this line of research included  one case study which addressed the potential of game design using a non-coding tool [@rafalow_connected_2014], there is no specific advice within this extensive body of research addressed how to operationalise this broader approach of connected learning as a specific pedagogy to support CGD&P in either formal or informal settings.  



<!-- In this book we have considered how mathematics might be learned in settings that resemble the Brazilian samba school, in settings that are real, socially cohesive, and where experts and novices are all learning. The samba school, although not ‘exportable’ to an alien culture, represents a set of attributes a learning environment should and could have. (Seymour Papert, Mindstorms, 1980)1 -->

## Design patterns

<!-- onal Sophicistication - using game patterns as a higher level which learners construct from scratch. -->

Design patterns, a concept originated in architecture , are structural solutions to common design problem rooted illustrated via concrete examples of design principles in context [@alexander1977pattern]. Design patterns can help the development of design communities when experienced coders document the patterns they for novices. The use of computational design patterns has been applied to computer programming and design [@gamma_design_1995]. A design pattern approach is commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing providing scaffolding via the modelling of community-based design decisions [@fojtik_design_2014-2]. Design pattern-based approaches have benefits in making complex problems more modular and concrete [@muller_almost_2004-1; @waite_teaching_2021]. Eriksson et al. [-@eriksson_using_2019], draw on the work of Höök and Löwgren [-@hook_strong_2012] to frame design patterns within games as a form of intermediate-level knowledge between the detail of concrete implementation and general theories. The value of the intermediate nature of the knowledge generated is to serve the replicability and generalisation of research work. Similarly Dearden [@dearden_pattern_2006, p. 20] advises caution in choosing the appropriate scope of pattern formulation noting that if that if they those "too abstract will be impractical in real design use; those that are too specific will be difficult to re-use in new scenarios."


<!-- Research in this area points to challenges of teaching the abstract nature of traditionally shared design patterns related to object oriented coding languages but points to visual methods and games as promising tactics [@azimullah_evaluating_2020; @da_cruz_silva_fostering_2019] -->

<!-- Höök and Löwgren [@hook_strong_2012] illustrate this _midway_ concepts as heuristics or design patterns between concrete instances of products and more general theories e.g. constructivism [@stolterman_concept-driven_2010]. -->
<!-- This research strand originates in the field of human-computer interaction [@eriksson_using_2019; @hook_strong_2012; @barendregt_intermediate-level_2018]; however, in most of these studies, the nature of the general theories is not clearly articulated. -->
<!-- MOVED HERE SO CLARIFY THE POINT OF THE ABOVE. SOMETHING TO DO WITH PLAY PARADOX? -->

**Turning specifically to the the use of game design patterns**

Turning specifically to the the use of game design patterns within games, the use of design patterns and has also been adopted by game designers and educators working with games in varied ways [@bjork_patterns_2005].  In professional context of game programming collections of structural game design patterns are used to share coding practice and to develop a shared language of game design [@bjork_games_2006]. Thus, the term game design patterns (GDP) is used in different ways with Kreimeier  distinguishing between content patterns and structural software engineering patterns [@kreimeier_case_2002]. Content patterns describe common patterns of design that are visible to the end user. Following the work of Bergström et al. [@bergstrom_exploring_2010], for the purposes of this study the term GDP refers to game play design patterns a subset of game design patterns referring to to content patters that would be recognisable or at least experienced by the game player as features of the game.


<!-- **Game design patterns in programming education Wernder etc** -->

<!-- In the work of Werner et al [-@werner2014using], game mechanics are seen as a higher end of a computational sophistication framework, due to skill needed to assemble the component elements.   -->

<!-- Werner and Denner built an ambitious assessment elements into a two year programme using Alice to make games. They built a software tool to quantify the levels of computational thinking, using a structure of thinking algorithmically [@werner_fairy_2012].
The results - a limited use of standard CT concepts by students - led them to also investigate the use of students of game mechanics as well as more traditional CS constructions [@werner_children_2012]. They began to identify use of design patterns and then combination of those patterns into large game mechanics. -->



<!-- Indeed players may become very familiar with these GDPs as they build their literacy as players about what they like or dislike about game they play.  -->
<!-- Recalling the issues of learners stress and the play paradox addressed above collections of patterns have been used to structure learners choice in the create or choose stage of project work [@franklin_analysis_2020].   -->

<!-- Other researchers  used to scaffold creation of coding projects by novices [@wang_novices_2021] and note barriers students encoutered including, mapping barriers, other -->



<!-- Thus structural game design patterns may be common ways of programming a game but may not be familiar to end-users. A common example would be that of the game loop.
https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html
By way of contrast,  -->
<!-- Software engineering patterns are used to structure code and keep it architecturally neat thus facilitating code sharing and extension. These patterns would be invisible to the end player of the game. Content patterns describe common patterns of game play and design that are visible to the player. -->

<!-- The following two examples draw on collections of GDPs to help design process (not involving programming) of games as an educational activity. -->

**Using Game Design pattern collections and code examples to help novice students.**

In a design education intervention working with 11-12 year olds Eriksson and colleagues [@eriksson_using_2019] used a collection of curated patterns to prompt learners to analyse and then propose changes to an existing collaborative game called Stringforce. The stringforce study involved learner analysis of games, the ability to change level design via graphical (not code based) editor and co-design of proposed conceptual changes to existing games. Their research drew on an existing collection of over 200 GDPs created in a related research project aimed at facilitating game production for novice adult game designers available as as a public collection [@bjork_patterns_2005] [^3]. The process of structuring these patterns drew on wider work on game theory, most directly the work on the MDA framework which outlines the value of framing GDPs into strands of game mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics [@bergstrom_exploring_2010]. Game mechanics are the rules and systems that govern gameplay. Game dynamics are the emergent behaviors resulting from these mechanics in player interaction. Game aesthetics invoke emotional responses in the player by gameplay elements like graphics, story and sound design.

The process of curating patterns for Stringforce involved selected only 14 from the full collection [@eriksson_using_2019]. The selection criteria for patterns to include in co-design stages included the following concerns; concrete patterns were favoured over more abstract ones to aid the learner comprehension, patterns chosen matched the learners' capabilities, patterns that were game mechanics were also prioritised as were pattern suggested by the learners. The Stringforce study surfaced several dimensions of utility of GDPs. GDP concepts were used in the following ways as lingua franca between researchers and participants; to aid the framing of analysis; and as a starting point to guide participants design suggestions [@eriksson_using_2019]. Overall, the primary focus of the results address benefits to researchers, advancing GDPs as a form of intermediate knowledge as a contribution to the field of child computer interaction research (CCI).



<!-- The Mechanics element of the framework has much in common with GDPs. The difference is explored by researchers [@olsson2014conceptual]. The common element is the utility of the concepts to designers. Although the process of formalising such patterns and mechanics is also noted.
THIS NEEDS CLARIFYING - ? BUT NOT TOO MUCH -->


<!-- The principle goals to is to address the perceived "challenge how to make results from research work related to this within Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) field easily transferable to future CCI research." [@baykal_using_2019] -->




### Game Star Mechanic and related work by Institute of Play


Game Star Mechanic (GSM) is an online software based on sociocultural understandings of learning, designed to develop systems thinking, design thinking and media literacy within games as a multimodal text [@salen_gaming_2007]. In GSM the process of making video games using a simplified block system to modify existing game and  does not require programming [@games_design_2008]. Design choices were driven by research outlining the benefits to exploring games over other types of media projects, including their inherent interactivity and rules based systems, which facilitate the exploration of systems thinking and design approaches [@games_gamestar_2010; @tekinbas_gaming_2014; @torres_learning_2009].

The pedagogy surrounding the GSM software drew on game theory by the Institute of Play founders [@salen_gaming_2007]. This work also fed into the process underlying the Moveable Game Jam outlined above. The guiding pedagogy is present in an extensive supporting pack for teachers [^4]. This guide used challenges themed around categorisation of game elements (space, components, mechanics, goals and rules. In evaluative reviews Games [-@games_design_2008 ; @games_gamestar_2010] describes how the design of the product allowed the use of learners background knowledge of game design patterns to facilitate complex forms of collaborative design and discourse between novice designers. Games also outlines the role of community elements of the surrounding pedagogy to help develop participants sense of an audience, and active critical roles within a design community [@gee_situated_2004].



<!-- Thus while existing research show the promise of GDPs in exploring systems thinking and developing an overall sense of game design, there is a gap in the research landscape in how GDP pattern collections could be used to support novices and young people to program computer games.

### Scalable game design

<!-- USEFUL WIKI
https://web.archive.org/web/20181119014430/https://sgd.cs.colorado.edu/wiki/Scalable_Game_Design_wiki -->


Scalable Game Design (SGD) SGD is an computing education program designed and delivered by Colorado University WHICH like GSM, created a software tool (AgentSheets) allowing game creation and supporting teaching and learning resources and training. Agent sheets used a block based, drag and drop programming approach. Extensive partnership work led by Repenning and Basawapatna [-@repenning_scalable_2010; -@basawapatna_using_2010], allowed large scale data collection from thousands of school students.

The researchers use the term Computational Thinking Patterns (CPTs) to describe patterns present in computer games which they support learners to code. It is the familiarity and understandability, and the ability to link to specific learning outcomes which which drew the SCG researchers towards a pattern-based approach compared to limitations of more abstract interpretations of computational thinking. This was driven by their interactions with teachers is to foreground concepts that have potential to transfer to the area of science simulations [@basawapatna_recognizing_2011]. The authors give examples of computational thinking patterns:  *generation* and *absorbtion* in predator / prey relationships, *transportation *of oxygen by red blood cells and mosquitoes *hill climbing* (seeking the highest value) of human scent.

A driving pedagogical approach was the use of a _project first_ rather than _principles first_ approach to learning programming [@repenning_scalable_2015]. Computational concepts, for example, loops, lists, logic and variables are recommended to be taught as learner require them to be used. To do this they advocate use of _just in time_ instruction, via a clear links between the instruction needed and the motivation to achieve a tangible goal within game design to keep learners in a zone of engagement [@basawapatna_zones_2013].

Another important concept in the SGD pedagogy is that of student ownership, present chiefly in the

participants ability to design their own characters and backgrounds [@repenning_scalable_2015]. One of the limitation of the pedagogy is the _heavy scaffolding_ [@repenning_scalable_2015. P.11.10] needed via step-by-step instructions due to complexity of the game authoring process. While the authors suggest letting the students create there own games, this is included as an optional activity at the end of a unit of work and one which many schools were not able to adopt due to time restrictions. This may account for relatively low figures for student ownership over projects. From 700 responses, only 139 (20%) indicated aspects of student ownership [@repenning_scalable_2015. P.11.10].

Other limitations in the overall approach is that the programme use bespoke software created by the team which can be problematic to maintain in the long term. In additions while the resources used were classified as being just in time, a review of the supporting website shows quite lengthy instruction based resources which would be a barrier to such claims [^5].


<!-- Both concepts of patterns can be identified by participants through their familiarity with software as users. Patterns are also shared within communities of established and novice designers as a way of saving time, encouraging code reuse and developing a shared vocabulary of concepts that enriches computational practice of the community participants. -->

<!-- ![\ Illustration 6: Examples of Computational Thinking Patterns from SGD programme](./Pictures/10000000000002AD000002581577508549E2425F.png){width="12.349cm" height="10.816cm"} -->


<!-- Example patterns are shown in the following diagram which is part of the assessment of individuals taking part in the programme. -->

<!-- The focus on transfer to science simulations concepts explains the increased distancing of language from transferable coding principles in both abstract and concrete forms. -->





<!-- In SGD the concept of proximal flow links flow theory and the vital importance of engagement, via scaffolding to the ZPD and the social and environmental nature of that support [@basawapatna_zones_2013].

This proximal flow theory developed into a particular tutorial format [@basawapatna_zones_2019].
The concept of just in time instruction aims to reduce boredom and increase engagement with strong linking between the instruction needed and the goal to achieve a tangible goal linked a game. -->



<!-- This characteristic may negatively impact engagement, due to danger of limited engagement with rote instructions explored above [@resnick_coding_2020] -->

<!-- While there are links with socio-cultural concept of ZPD, there are limits in the approach and in the framing of the results. -->

<!-- Beyond the following of instructions, the process by which students return to flow are not discussed. Given the social nature of the process this seems to neglect the possible uses of design pattern in peer learning.   -->

Could move some of this to the results discussion -
"- Problem-Solving for Game Interaction Design: Patterns can contain various potential solutions for designers which have identified problems with specific interaction parts a game concept.
- Inspiration: Pattern collections embed gameplay concepts found useful in other games, and can therefore serve as a knowledge source for new game designs or redesigns of existing ones.
- Structured Design Tool: Both by enumerating concepts as individual patterns and by providing relations between patterns, a pattern collection can help designers to work through different levels of abstraction in a design in a structured fashion.
- Communication: The patterns offer the possibility to describe the design in a standardized format to make the understanding and comparison of different designs easier. This can be designers communicating with other designers but can also be participants discussing with other participants. The offering of a standardized format for concepts can potentially also increase the likelihood of members of heterogeneous groups being able to see each other as peers since they can communicate in a common way." -->


<!--
In my own game making model students picked missions from a choice of printed resources. There were four colour themed categories of missions. _Game mechanics_ are features to do with the actions of the game. _Game space_ patterns address the layout of the game. _Game polish_ patterns involve adding music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements. Finally _System and Challenge_ patterns look at how different elements interact to create challenge in the game. An example of a game mechanic design pattern follows. -->




<!-- They described the utility of games design patterns as a _lingua franca_ for game developers. Other benefits cited are GDP as a source  creative inspiration and as an aid to problem-solving. -->


## Synthesis of chapter / discussion / problem statement


In the following section, I summarise the chapters findings and clarify the problem statement of this thesis.


<!-- - **Guided participation:** There is a stream in the research which critiques not-only instruction-based approaches but also child-led discovery within magically designed  tools and communities. Rogoff's take on guided participation as between these poles informs this study.
- **Tensions surrounding authenticity of tool use:** my desire to link with developer communities and the world of open sources introduces tensions.
- **Lack of specific pedagogies in this zone not exclusive to this domain:** given Rogoff's perspective, and research on PBL approaches , (flexible - explain) frameworks are useful. While this review has identifies some, more are useful.
- **Structural challenges continue but the stuggle continues:** schools, curriculum etc, financial sustainability, limits of sustained volunteer activities, - however change is possible, this research provides a possible avenue.   -->

**Short problem statement PLANNING SECTION - now a reacap**

- Motivation: Given the context explored in Chapter 1, it is essential that we understand how to support empowerment and inclusion in the field of CGD&P. Despite the extensive and broad scope of existing research limitations remain.
- Gaps in research: Specifically, while the broad importance of socio-cultural dimensions are explored in the framing of reviews of research  of CGD&P
- Clarified Problem statement: This research will address








<!-- The latest iteration compuational fluency, is described in broad strokes as both technical competency and an ability to for self-expression within digital code mediums [@resnick_computational_2018].

If viewed from a wider socio-cultural perspective what potential does games making have in increasing this fluency, what in particular about games is relevant to this potential, how can the characteristics of such fluency in more depth using socio-cultural concepts. Finally, what is the potential role of a open ended, socio-cultural research process help develop a pedagogy which encourages this fluency.    -->


### Returning to gaps in the CGD&P research landscape
<!-- In Chapter x, I outlined in broad strokes areas of the landscape of computer game design and programming (CGD&P) -->
<!-- While the work of Waite and Sentence begins to address sociocultural aspects of teaching programming [@sentance_teaching_2019; @hwang_using_2023], this work is limited in scope and invites further exploration. -->

This section returns to the guiding research questions in relation to the existing gaps in the research landscape which invite further study. In broad terms the review and surrounding work of Kafai and Burke [@kafai_constructionist_2015; @kafai_connected_2016] cite a relative deficit in research addressing game making compared to game making and within that a relative dearth of studies addressing social and cultural pedagogies. The second point is confirmed in Denner et al's later systemic review [@denner_does_2019].

In particular there is a lack of specific pedagogies to address how to support the dimensions of

- formation of making identities
- peer interaction beyond feedback,
- inclusive induction into community activities.

---

PARKED FOR NOW

given Rogoff's and PBL research's advocacy of guided participation, frameworks existing between instruction and pure discoverary processes, more are useful. In particular domain specific ones.

**Gaps in agency / fluency / empowerment**

Despite Papert's [@lodi_computational_2021] early focus on the importance of community participation and resulting forms of fluency, existing research in this field is still lacking in this area in particular surrounding specifics on a microlevel informing how what Kafai calls collective agency is formed.

In this chapter I have agued that while innovative  Papert's constructionism lack theoretical foundations, a deficit which can be addressed by integrating the motivations, in particular that of varied concepts of fluency [@papert_technological_1995; @resnick_computational_2018; @kafai201221] and design heuristics [@resnick_reflections_2005] with more contemporary socio-cultural concepts.

**Focusing on Agency is valid because**  it is a way to address relevant concepts of fluency in this domain with greater theoretical rigour.

Specifically the lack of pedagogies for non-formal spaces should be addressed.

Stress of facilitators, technical barriers, lack of frameworks to chart agency development, confusion over what the goal is.

**RECAP OF POTENIAL?**

<!-- One premise driving my exploration of the use of gameplay features in pedagogy is that the  -->


**Lack of specific pedagogies aligned with socio-cultural approaches**

#### Pedagogies exist but more are needed

Chapter 1, outlined needs of the study within a problem framing which addressed barriers to participation of x,y and z.

The specific choice of a code playground and a professional JavaScript game library provide specific setting that merits investigation.

This chapter has outlined some promising pedagogical approaches in research in CGD&P and digital making more broadly but also located gaps meriting more investigation.  

Pair and peer programming show promise but (what are limits?) [@werner2014using].

UMC [@lee_computational_2011] offer a general structure to organise a remix-ed based approaches as a way to leverage social sharing, and the related work on half-baked games places this with a game making context underlining the importance of game features as motivating factors [@kynigos_children_2018].  

The use of design patterns in this context is promising to help motivation and structure documentation [@repenning_scalable_2015] and to structure feedback process in a  co-design process [@eriksson_using_2019]. However these existing studies have limitations. In the SGD [@repenning_scalable_2015], there were limitations in participant pathways and resulting reduction in student ownership. Addressing Stringforce [@eriksson_using_2019], the potential use of GDPs for participants and teachers is under-explored. Additionally as participants did not modify computer code this invites research to assess the utility of a collection of GDPs to support programming.

Thus, in summary, while some suitable and inclusive pedagogies exists, more are needed that are specific, aligned with non-formal spaces, facilitate agency development, and development of learner identity drawing on funds on knowledge.



**Cultural factors**

Tacit knowledge of gaming conventions among most family members is extensive, even if they are not avid gamers, due to the extensive influence of video game culture in mainstream culture, including contexts of family life [@ito_hanging_2010; @livingstone_digital_2018], particularly retro gaming [@heineman2014public]. As such, the process of facilitating ways to surface and work with such tacit knowledge can support Moll's [@moll_funds_1992] concept of the potential funds of knowledge and funds of identity [@fasso_identity_2020; @esteban-guitart_funds_2014].



**A specific and replicable pedagogy - MOVE TO CH.4?**
Given that few studies communicate pedagogical detail in a way which allows replication, in this study I leverage my own commitment to and experience in documenting learning processes and facilitation materials via openly-licenced, accessible documenation and description to address this deficit.  




### Link to the next chapter

Having explored the remit of the problem statement, and the body of literature relevant to this domain, we can see that a research approach which allows for a detailed exploration of both context, pedagogy and learner agency is required. In the following chapter I outline the approach of the study to achieve these goals based on the principle theoretical framework of activity theory.
