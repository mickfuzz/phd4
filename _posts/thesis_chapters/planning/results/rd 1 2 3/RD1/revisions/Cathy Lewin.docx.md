### The Research Project

Is the working title of the project appropriate for the researchproposal?

**Comments**

I like the title but identifying the focus (the potential for what?)might be helpful. It doesn\'t seem to match the proposal as it standswhich seems to focus on developing a pedagogy for supportingintergenerational game-making,although of course the pedagogy will (orshould) impact on learners.

Is the proposal approximately 1000 ( 10%) words and a font size 12?

**Comments**

I think that this proposal draws on too many aspects which makes itover-complicated and difficult to follow. There is mention of playful,agency, pedagogic framework, collaborative learning, intergenerational,game-making, learner autonomy\.... etc etc. These might all be ofinterest but perhaps it would be easier to start by being a little morefocused. I wonder if re-visiting the research questions might behelpful. They seem more like aims (eg to develop a pedagogicalframework) or what you need to do in a thesis anyway (eg identifyappropriate data collection approaches). What is it you want to find outas a result of your research? Isn\'t the learner experience of this key?And you have two different groups of learners - adults and children.It\'s also not clear how activity theory will be used to develop apedagogic framework. It could be use to review the activity (ofintergenerational game-making) and identify how it could be developedthrough considering the contradictions in the system. So it seems ahelpful theoretical framework through which to consider what is going onwhen the game-making is actually happening. But remember that theactivity system is the unit of analysis - participants, practices andmaterials are all part of the activity system. I\'m not sure how itwould be useful when developing the initial pedagogical approach. Youmight have a clear idea of this but it has not been explained clearly inthe proposal.

### Research Design and Methods

Is the theoretical analysis of methods appropriate to the field ofstudy?

![](media/image11.png){width="0.6944444444444444in"height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes![](media/image32.png){width="0.6944444444444444in"height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

**Comments**

It\'s not completely clear what will happen in each phase. There aredifferent types of workshops referred to - what is the role of thecollaborative design workshops in phases 1 and 3? And who will beinvolved in these? It would be helpful to identify how long interviewswill be. And will the participant interviews include adults andchildren? If so, will 3 of each be sufficient? Will the pilot workshopsbe observed?

### Contribution to knowledge

**For MPhil/PhD or PhD only:** Will the proposed research make asignificant contribution to knowledge?

![](media/image31.png){width="0.6944444444444444in"height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes![](media/image17.png){width="0.6944444444444444in"height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

**Comments**

This is an under-researched field and once the focus has been tightenedup and more detail provided in relation to the methodology it will makea significant contribution to the field.

### Ethics

I have undertaken an independent scrutiny of the Ethics Checklist andreviewed the Ethics Checklist Form (for RNCM students, this will be theEthical Clearance Form)

Written Report for the Student and Supervisory Team---------------------------------------------------

**The scrutineer is asked to provide context for the recommendationproposed above and to provide guidance or advice that will be beneficialto the student and supervisory team**

See feedback above.

Please address the following:

1\) Revisit the research questions to make the project more focused. Youcould change some of the current research questions to objectives.Perhaps focus on the learner groups (their experiences, the outcomes) -parents and children

2\) Revisit your mentions of activity theory - if you are using it todevelop the pedagogical framework then explain how this will happen - ifnot, then delete an mention of it at this point. Where you refer to itin relation to analysis you should ensure that you talk about it inrelation to the unit of analysis being the activity system.

3\) Ensure that the data collection methods are clearly explained, thatthe missing detail identified above is provided, and that the textexplaining the phases matches the table (and the GANTT chart).
