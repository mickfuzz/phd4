 Constructivism and Complex Learning Environments =================================================

My study interest is situated in learning in technology rich,intergenerational environments. This writing covers the foundations andcharacteristics of the learning theory of constructivism and exploresits relevance to understanding such complex learning ecologies.

Foundations of constructivism-----------------------------

The foundations of constructivism can be usefully contrasted tobehavioural and cognitive learning theories, both of which have anobjectivistic views of the world. Objectivism in a philosophical contextcan be described as viewing the reality as external to and independentof the human mindJonassen,1991). Applied to a learning context, the behavioural school uses thisperspective to justify for a focus on direct instruction as knowledgesuits direct transmission. Effective learning then is the maximisationof fidelity to the original knowledge which can be tested withoutrecourse to examining the processes of the mind.

Bruner and Kant (also in Jonassen)

Kant

While, the cognitive school began to explore mental processes, oftenusing a metaphor of mind as computer, some pioneers of this movementincluding Bruner began to question the effectiveness of this metaphor,conclusions and implications for application in educationBruner,1990).

More on computer metaphor?

His concern is that the specialisation of cognitivists on informationprocessing capabilities of the mind was detractive from exploring its'meaning-making' capabilities1990,p. 2). This focus on meaning-making and a view of knowledge asconstructed rather than received form the foundation of constructivism.The core element of knowledge construction is expanded with furtheranalysis in the following section.

Outline of key concepts of constructivism-----------------------------------------

To best explore implications for education of a constructivistperspective, fundamental concepts of the theory should be examined. Thisprocess is made more complex by the varieties of schools ofconstructivism. Palincsar explores a tentative spectrum, with a radicalconstructivism rooted in a social construction of reality at one end anda move conservative, individually focused view of the construction ofknowledge at the other1998).*(Phillips has a three dimensional model of divergences*[]{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"x6gOX5Uh","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Derry, 1996)","plainCitation":"(Derry, 1996)"},"citationItems":[{"id":4459,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/9RLFJYIF"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/9RLFJYIF"],"itemData":{"id":4459,"type":"article-journal","title":"Cognitive schema theory in the constructivist debate","container-title":"Educational Psychologist","page":"163-174","volume":"31","issue":"3-4","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","abstract":"Cognitive constructivism is not a unique theoretical framework, pedagogical approach, or epistemology, but a general, metaphorical assumption about the nature of cognition that virtually all cognitive educational researchers accept.

This article contrasts cognitive constructivism with several other forms of constructivism in the educational research community. It then attempts to represent the range of theoretical approaches within cognitive constructivism, pointing to examples and potential educational applications of cognitive constructivist ideas. Cognitive schema theory receives special attention as an important theoretical perspective that has been relatively neglected in recent theoretical discussions. It is believed to have significant potential for building conceptual bridges between information processing and radical constructivist viewpoints.","DOI":"10.1080/00461520.1996.9653264","ISSN":"0046-1520","author":[{"family":"Derry","given":"Sharon J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",6,1]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDjPBBoOpyCf}*(Derry,1996))*

Despite this variety, overarching themes of a constructivist view oflearning can be identified. The work of Grabinger and colleagues oncreating rich environments for active learning (REALs), which isexamined in more detail in the final section of this writing, isinstructive in this aspectGrabingerand Dunlap, 1995; Grabinger et al., 1997).

Grabinger and Dunlap prioritise three characteristics of constructivism;knowledge is cumulative and a result of active processes, context isused by individuals to personalise knowledge and the importance ofcollaboration and social negotiation of meaning. These themes are nowexplored in more depth with examples and some divergent opinions.

Active nature of knowledge creation

Piaget's work can be seen as a strong influence on constructivisttheory. A significant contribution was his work to support the positionthat knowledge is an active process where the learner constructsknowledge using evolving cognitive structures. Piaget referred to thesestructures as schema and the process of their construction asassimilation of accommodation of information. These terms will now beexplained.

Schema from the Piaget can be described as mental frames groupingtogether understanding around big ideas DEFINE BETTER

Piaget's understanding of schema can be contrasted to a working,inclusive definition favoured in information processing / cognitivescience circles including memory objects and mental modelsDerry,1996).

Their use facilitates processing and storing of information that is notin contradicting with the existing model, a process Piaget described asassimilation. While many see that process as frictionless, von Glasefeldasserts the active nature of the process. CITATION

Conversely, when information being processed is experienced as in'dis-equilibrium' with existing schema, then a process of accommodationis said to happen, resulting in an updated and more complex schema.

There is a debate about weather the social nature or individual focus ofknowledge creation is compatible, pitching Piaget against Vysgotky.While Cobb doesn't see a conflict Duffy does -Cunninghamand Duffy, 1996, p. 6).

The active process of overcoming this conflict is also identified byDuffy & Savery in a review of constructivist viewpointsSaveryand Duffy, 1995). The authors redefine Piaget's dis-equilibrium aspuzzlement and cite vonGlaserfeld's assertion that the people andenvironment surrounding us provide the greatest source of suchperturbationVonGlasersfeld, 1998). The importance of context is explored in the nextsection.

Von Glasersfeld also discusses a useful concept of viability statingthat as the active restructuring of the schema does not bring thelearner closer to an objective reality but it can be said to be moreviable within the learners social contextVonGlasersfeld, 1998)
