And anything to do with AT and PBL as a pedagogy.

## Much older

**Overall**

We can leave to one side the influence of dgbl and serious games and integration of COTS into class, covered elsewhere in a completed lit review. Or does it need to be? Making is very separate in terms of processes as far as collaboration is concerned, and much more direct in terms of systems thinking, and design , prototyping are clearly present in making and not in playing.

Instead focus on pedagogical value and approaches to game making.

studies on game making, through the ages.

Group by outcome? Rather than underlying pedagogical approaches

-   Subject matter knowledge, maths papert,

-   Computational thinking

-   Collaboration & communication

-   Design processes, tinkering

However if you did want to list approaches, this could be...

linked to the underlying principles of constructivism. More specifically the following

-   discovery learning,

-   constructionist approaches

-   social learning, including cop

-   Situated Learning

Part of this writing is getting a flow of it together. Define terms, give examples of studies, outline results, then question validity of a particular study.

-   question, how much have constructionist studies been skewed by the     > enthusiasm of research designers, we can find studies where     > replication is less effective.

-   Put this first?

-   Modding as practice, Robertson, but what pedagogy is involved here?

Contextual & Economic issues of use of cots games, and factors involving choice of environment

-   When moving to formal education, assessment is a nightmare,     > practical work is depriotrised due to coursework issues in uk,     > time bonded / boxed approaches (see next section)

-   Use of little big world, great but pricey.

Family learning and why some things are hard in school

-   Not tied to assessment and time bonded learning.

-   While there is a limited time for family learning, this is a great     > candidate, low cost,

-   Persistence , element of collaboration

-   Validation of effort and that activity is worthwhile from family     > members, bringing a wider perspective

-   Time factors can be overcome,

-   Also optional, not everyone will love it , that sense of it's a     > choice is good

Family learning issues

-   Class and social capital limits scalability

-   Keeping motivation with surrounding distractions, Development of     > practice at home especially

-   The impact of environment, inspirational,

The mission , the project as an educational concept , project based learning, situated learning. Cop

-   Stealth, unfocused learning stemming from mission.

Specific to my game making project

-   Use of templates or shared paths to facilitate inter group learning

-   Gamification techniques in facilitating, set difficulty level, mad     > skills?

-   More homework to explore other paths and report back to group as     > mission cards , as part of facilitating sessions.
