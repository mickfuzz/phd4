> Ehn formulates a philosophical foundation of the design of computer > artifacts through the ideas of Heidegger, Marx, and Wittgenstein. In > laying the conceptual basis for PD he strongly critiques the Cartesian > rationalism of systems design. Ehn argues that design is concerned > with social and creative activity founded in our traditions, but > aiming at transcending them by constructing alternative futures. He > states: "The dialectics of tradition and transcendence --that is what > design is all about" \[5 p. 7\]

**PD Applied to Games**

In de Freitas, S., 2007. Learning in Immersive worlds: A review of game-based learning. JISC, Bristol.

The work on participatory design, that is where learners become more actively involved in the design of e-learning content, by Allison Druin (2002) and colleagues (Guha et al., 2004), and the work of Kurt Squire and colleagues (2003; 2005) are examples of this notable trend.
