**On Gaming Fluencies: Pathways into Participatory Culture in a Community Design Studio**

**Kylie A. Peppler\]**

This takes a pop at GSM - highlighting that Scratch is not a specilised toolset for game design, and therefore a wider set of 'gaming fluencies' are available to students

Breaks it down roughly based on some archival creations x 3 - of games created in computer clubhouse -

Into 'creative' literacies, mostly to do with sprite animation and perspectives -

And technical literacies, computation concepts (practical), and interactiviy types

I would disagree, with major premise that these are gaming literacies - as these seem more to do with multimedia product activities.

Compare this to the GSM approach, the more bespoke, black box elements that provide tools and affordances for novice coders to make genuine games, and then benefits of doing this.\ \ Summary of some issue

-   Focusing on systems approach more realistic - given limited toolset

-   Playtesting better as better games, more playable, so designing for     > others better served

-   Animation and user perspective are aesthetic consideration which may     > build motivation and ownership, but are not gaming literacies per     > say, more multimedia literacies

-   There are technical challenges like programming gravity in scratch,     > dealing with platforms and collision,

-   Expressly creating tools and affordances for game design patterns     > encourages exploration and revision and thus develops fluency

-   The study demonstrates a desire to create games from the young     > people but you may just as well say that they are created despite     > scratch's qualities, rather than because of it

-   And notable that one game was unfinished - and danger of     > exceptionalism here too
