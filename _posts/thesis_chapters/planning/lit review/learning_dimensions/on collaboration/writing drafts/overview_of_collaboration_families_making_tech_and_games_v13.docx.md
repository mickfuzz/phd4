Overview of Collaboration in a Techy Family Learning Setting and Game Making  =============================================================================

The focus of this study is particular to family learning environments, collaborative production of artefacts and meaning. I am using constructivist and sociocultural perspectives. This writing aims to problematise definitions of collaboration, to describe methods of studying such collaboration and discuss resulting outcomes. Due to the wide range of contexts and methods covered this writing is only able to touch on underlying difference in methodologies briefly in the conclusion.

The research around collaborative processes and digital game making for learning is limited (Earp, 2015; Kafai and Burke, 2015). Earp and colleagues note "analysis of collaboration is mainly restricted to peer review and providing feedback" (2013, p. 2), with the focus on most studies being on learner attitudes, subject knowledge or skill acquisition (Bermingham et al., 2013). As a practical response, this writing widens in focus to include the related fields pair programming, creative computing, physical making and tinkering and intergenerational participatory design.

A common theme associated with game making programmes is that they support the development of 21^st^ Century Skills . Definitions of 21^st^ Century Skills vary widely (Binkley et al., 2009). In an analysis of wider frameworks (Voogt and Roblin, 2012), twenty first century skills have been summarised as collaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social/cultural skills & citizenship, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and productivity/development of quality products. As these terms are complex and complementary (Kickmeier-Rust and Albert, 2012), I will explore the term collaboration, to better situate particular aspects of collaboration most relevant to this study.

Collaboration can be conflated with group work. In a review of research on group work (Cohen, 1994), collaboration is seen as a desirable, social outcome of such group work in line with sociocultural approaches. The author notes that effective learning designs are need to prevent work which could be done individually being assigned to a group, changing little but the seating arrangement. She suggest the use of "ill-structured tasks" (1994, p. 4), which have many possible, as a way to ensure effective team working.

A broad conception of collaboration is shared by Resnick in the context of creation of online coding projects (2007). He references the concept of Participatory Culture advanced by Jenkins where people share created or appropriated a wide variety of digital artefacts on using various forms of internet, but most commonly specific sharing and social media sites including YouTube, Flickr and Facebook where the work is viewed by other users, often forming the basis for comments and conversations. In the context of sharing programmable media and games, the result is a "collaborative community" (2007, p. 4), where users can borrow and build upon the work of others. In one regard this kind of collaboration could be seen a much more individualised process than the collective or cooperative work described by Dillenbourg, more of community participation than actually collaboration. However such an interpretation would neglect the possibilities of online tools and processes to facilitate the kind of Joint Problem Space described earlier. Examples of tools and communities that successfully manage this type of asynchronous but detailed collaboration on specific task are wiki communities for collaborative writing (Forte and Bruckman, 2007), using a wiki to develop language skills (Kessler and Bikowski, 2010), and use of distributed code authoring tools to build open source software (Dabbish et al., 2012). The educational value offered by the collaborative possibilities online tools provide are still in the process of being evaluated and integrated into more formal learning settings (Zagalsky et al., 2015). Their distributed and asynchronous nature provide both opportunities and challenges, .

The field of computer enhanced learning has explored collaborative learning in depth, partly as a response to the danger that technology individualises learning, thus cutting learners off from valuable group insights (Stahl et al., n.d.). Dillenbourg compares cooperation and collaboration, seeing cooperation as a jigsaw activity where individuals take on parts of a wide task and work on them individually, compared to collaboration where the tasks are taken on together and meaning is collectively created (Dillenbourg, 1999).

> In cooperation, partners split the work, solve sub-tasks individually > and then assemble the partial results into the final output. In > collaboration, partners do the work 'together.' (p. 8)

Similarly, Rochelle and Teasley explore processes involved in face-to-face (synchronous) collaboration where learners are undertaking joint problem solving involving computers (1995). The co-construction of knowledge here is presented in the form of language, and use of other artefacts to both a) enable problem solving and b) use negotiating strategies to maintain a Joint Problem Space. These two activities are held to be essential and co-dependant. The authors present a framework for analysing these interaction; turn taking, socially distributed production (especially the completion of if-then proposals), repairs, narrations (talking aloud intentions in activity), language and action. The researchers noted the use of the computer by learners as a way of disambiguating language with reference to something more concrete on the screen.

These variances in the interpretations of the term collaboration provide a bases for analysis of studies of areas of practice. The following sections take a closer look at studies on participant collaboration in domains related to the target field of family game making. A discussion section follows outlining tensions and areas for fruitful future research.

Capturing Pair Programming and Collaborative Coding ---------------------------------------------------

Denner, Werner and colleagues undertook two studies on pair programming as an effective social intervention in middle school to increase programming knowledge using the Flash multimedia and Storytelling Alice tool (Denner and Werner, 2007; Werner et al., 2013, 2009). The earlier study using Flash used journals and audiotape transcriptions. In journals students were asked to reflect on how they solved problems. Audio tape transcripts were analysed to identify patterns of pair interactions. Emerging patterns include; problem identification and debugging which highlight the need to agree on a shared understanding of the nature of the problem, resource signposting and highlighting the difference between working code and non-working examples sometimes using 'playful interaction' as a strategy to mitigate frustrations (Denner and Werner, 2007, p. 146). Results also found that the pair interactions were are times problematic leading to frustration in of themselves if partners did not interact well (Denner, 2007).

The later study used statistical analysis of dyad interaction over time across multiple time points (Werner et al., 2013, p. 4). The results find computer confidence to most significant factor in improvement in programming knowledge compared to difference in previous knowledge of the software environment used and friendship factors.

While many similar studies looking at the kind of dyad learning involved in pair programming and statistical analysis of academic results compared to individual study (McDowell et al., 2002; Mullins et al., 2011; Nagappan et al., 2003), fewer exist which capturing the processes of collaboration. One exception is a study by Ching and Kafai (2008) on peer interactions in environmental simulation creation by elementary children using the programming language Logo. They develop a model to allow a richer description of helping activities, particularly those of collaborative socialisation and peer guidance. Their framework describing collaborative peer roles was created based on video and audio recording of iterations between forth graders who were tasked with creating simulations and fifth graders tasked to support others students. It describes group organisation, initiation processes and outlines help strategies used, namely periodic monitoring, responding to questions and immediate intervention. The intervention described in this study advocated a prescriptive approach to pair / peer interaction as a tactical response to the often intensive demands on teacher time when classes are engaged in coding tasks.

Creative Computing  -------------------

In this context Creative Computing is a broad term for the exploration of tools and practices around making diverse artefacts with multimedia software allowing programming and easy to use electronics. The term is used by a school of researches and designers clustered around the MIT Media Lab and their work stemming from pioneering work on the LOGO programming language by Seymour Papert (1980). One of their most visible and researched tool is currently Scratch. Scratch is free desktop and web software used to support coding of games and other media projects. It uses coloured code blocks rather than a text based approach, allows incorporation of a wide variety of media and has an online community for sharing created works. It is productive to look at some of the research and researchers that make up the Scratch community as a way of exploring some of the different threads of research around collaboration using this tool.

As previously mentioned, Resnick explores Scratch as a tool allowing the the sharing of user created artefacts . A Scratch creation is open by default, allowing other users of the site to click on a *See Inside* button to view the code blocks used to construct it. Resnick highlights the collaborative potential offered by the Scratch toolset. Specifically, the abilities to remix programmable media, to form production teams, and give each other feedback (2007).

Many of Resnick's papers focus on design considerations or technical considerations to lower the barriers to engage in programming (Resnick et al., 2009, 2005; Resnick and Silverman, 2005), Others focus on the user experience use individual anecdotes of actual use (Brennan et al., 2010; Resnick, 2012).

Their is the danger that as an enthusiastic advocate of Scratch as a tool, Resnick is cherry picking user stories in an unrepresentative way. SO CAUTION ABOUT TAKING THESE CLAIMS AT FACE VALUE BUT OTHER STUDIES ARE OUT THERE. FIND AN OPPOSITIONAL ONE OR TWO.

More extensive and complimentary studies focusing on user collaboration in the online Scratch community have been carried out by Resnick's colleagues (Fields et al., 2014, 2013; Hill and Monroy-Hernandez, 2013; Roque et al., 2012).

A study by Roque and colleagues shows pro-active members of the community engaging in remixing and competitions (2012). The authors describe the range of sophisticated technical and social processes that new users need to juggle in order to be an active member of collaborative Scratch projects or competitions. However, examination of log files on the platform server show that only a small minority of users are involved in such collaborative processes (Fields et al., 2014). To counter this disparity of use Roque and colleagues have explored strategies around the creation of learning designs and structures around coding events and competitions to support the development of the social behaviours which help collaboration within the online community (2016b),

Beyond this focus on online support, and with a mind to the problems of inequality to of access to and creative participation in such a participatory culture , Roque later shifted focus to develop facilitated creative processes in out of school settings with family participation (Roque, 2016). The programme in question, Family Creative Learning, drew on the technical capability of Scratch to allow users to incorporate diverse media materials to make the project personal, and thus increase motivation and identification with project. In two iterations of a four session programme, Parents and children used of physical computing tools, namely the easy to use sensor kit Makey Makey, as well as non-digital materials and activities to lower barriers to participation and build collaborative capacities of learners before non familiar digital task. Data collection comprised video data of interactions, facilitator field notes and interviews with participant and facilitators. The experience of young people, parents and facilitators was analysed using Barron's framework of parental roles to support learning with technology (2009). Significal behaviours identified in parents included, collaborating with children, learning from children, brokering other learning opportunities, providing non-technical support and access to technical resources.

This study is significant as the level of detail that parents, children and facilitators were able to share in interviews and the triangulation possible with video recording and field notes allow for a richer interpretation of learning experience offered by case studies focused around artefacts offered in other Scratch studies (Resnick, 2012).

Roque identifies the adoption of parental roles as temporary, with participants shifting between them and moving into new roles over the course of programme (2016a). The use of non-digital activities, crafting activities had potential for parents to connect to previous competencies and identities in a way that reduced anxiety surrounding working with new technologies. In addition such activities helped make coding processes concrete for participants facilitating the construction of shared language and understandings. Interviews with volunteer facilitators proved useful to identify helping behaviours to support the development of parent interactions (Roque and Jain, 2018). Maria noted the importance of modelling a tinkerers mindset to families (a concept explore later). Sam noted his development of a sense of the balance between over and under facilitation. Alex felt proud at making good judgement calls about being a positive and constructive additions to a particular families 'learning dynamic' resulting from the building of a relationship which allowed him to learn about participants interests and drivers (2018, p. 6).

The shifting roles observed in FCL may indicate a level of sophistication that is hard to replicate. While this study, used facilitators to identify, praise and therefore encourage various roles, these observations also brings to the fore one of the dilemmas facing learning designs which encourage collaborative work. While it may be tempting to structure, formalise and instruct participants on their roles in collaboration, a process favoured by processes such as reciprocal teaching, as Dillenboug points out such restrictions remove the valuable aspect of negotiating roles from the collaborative process (1999).

A self-reported limitation of the study are that the parents involved all had at least one parent who had a positive predisposition to the use of technologies for creative purposes. In addition to this, the high level of support from a large team of facilitators in the process and low participant numbers would make this a difficult programme to scale up and roll out.

This brings us back a tension then of the value of construction kits whose design and affordances allow a high degree of self-directed learning and are therefore easy to be deployed as scale (note the high take up of instruction-based Scratch activities in schools), and the value of a more facilitated

The following section explores an environment which requires a low intervention level from facilitators, that of tinkering and making activities in museums. The

Tinkering & Making in Makerspaces ---------------------------------

I want to acknowledge the complexities involved in terms making and tinkering associated with the Maker Movement (Vossoughi and Bevan, 2015). However for the purposes of this writing give a broad definition as activities as the making and sharing physical objects as a non-professional activity.

In a series of three case studies on adult focused Makerspaces, Sheridan describes them as communities of practice (2014), where legitimate peripheral activity of new comers allows them to survey, and gradually actively participate in the activities of the space. The important consideration here in terms of participation and collaborations between community member is that it is unregulated and open, especially in contrast more prescriptive, instruction based approaches.

Making and tinkering is also popular in the context of informal and youth oriented exploration of STEM context where they often associated with with inviting and technical and everyday craft materials. Crowley and Brahms describe museum making spaces as distinct from traditional interactive exhibits in their material use of real tools, loose parts and presence of skilled facilitators (2016).

The authors acknowledge established frameworks of design principles that attract, hold and communicate to families in museums (Borun and Dritsas, 1997) but contend that they should be expanded to encompass the complex processes occurring between families and facilitators over time. The authors underline the need to expanding the unit of time in analysis of the kind of learning happening. Using in-depth case studies involving extensive documentation and semi-structured interviews with young visitors and their family members they focus on a trajectory of learners over many visits.

SO WHAT,

In making spaces tinkering often begins immediately using prototypes with no formal needs analysis of the product. In their review of tinkering and making, Vossoughi and Bevan explore tensions surrounding use of materials which is lowers barriers to entry for participants yes not be too limiting technically, which provides immediate feedback but can involve a wide range of materials or genres (2015). Bevan and colleagues at the Exploratorium museum in San Fransciso have developed a framework which explores the social aspects of tinkering (Bevan et al., 2015). The framework is a product of in-depth analysis of video recordings and conversations between participants as the interact with tinkering museum exhibits. Of the four categories identified in their learning dimensions framework, while one one, social scaffolding, explicitly explored collaboration as a outcome of the process, the others, engagement, initiative and dimensions of understanding, are all measured in the context of communication happening in the context of collaborative activities. As such, the indicators used to locate the learning dimensions are social rather than cognitive in focus, drawing on Vygotskian concepts of expansive conceptions of learning which the authors describe as moving "beyond tradition school-like conceptions (knowing), beyond traditional constructivist conceptions (doing), to include conceptions of the socially and situated developing self (being and becoming)" (2013).

Advocates of Making as an educational activity have concerns that attempts to ingrate the success of the Maker Movement practices into a more formal setting may result in a degradation of value.

We can contrast the more experimental side of the maker movement with the more instructional kit assembly approaches. Repetitive making based on preset instructions or temptation towards 'trivial fabrication' fails to exploit potential problem solving and design challenges latent in the materials (Blikstein, 2013).

ACCUSATIONS OF TECH BIAS, MILITARISM AND WHITE MALE FOCUS (Vossoughi et al., 2016; Vossoughi and Vakil, 2018)

As a counterpoint to the previous critiques of lack of effective exploration of values in making , Ratto's concept of Critical Making has a focus of the potential of the process to do just that (2011). He identifies critical thinking and exploration of civic concerns as a potential outcome of the process of the social making of objects. He highlights a gulf between technical work and social work that critical making can bridge. More specifically, in the exploration of societal issues effected by technology. He finds use in a distinction between *caring about* an issue and a more informed *caring for* an issue informed by experience and a sense of responsibility.

PROCESS AND STUDY

This stems from the reframing of our reality as designed rather than discovered. Thus shifting matters of fact (which can't be changed) into matters of concern where the outcome is at play (Latour, 2008). In the exploration of two case studies the author recommends acknowledging and exploring the reductive nature of process of translating complex social issues into physical and digital models as a way of mitigating risks of over simplification discussions (Ratto, 2011, p. 8).

Participatory Design & Collaborative Inquiry --------------------------------------------

Resnick explicitly characterises the immediacy of tinkering compared to 'planning' (2013), and Brahms explores the attractive nature of Maker materials and processes within the context of a museum's need to draw their audience into immediate interaction with their exhibition spaces. In this section I compare this approach to the more context sensitive approach of more traditional design methods. The design process has many strands but common themes include the importance attached to the following stages, ideation techniques stages building on user requirements, iterative approaches involving the use of physical or testable prototypes and integrating user testing to inform improvements (Flanagan et al., 2005; Scaife and Rogers, n.d.).

Participatory Design (PD) involves users extensively in ideation and planning stages and involves techniques to make values present in the design process and product explicit (Schuler and Namioka, 1993). While the majority of PD methods are aimed at commercial products or public services, the exploration of values, empathy, and user experience facilitate better learning designs is also suited to improving educational designs and technologies (Bonsignore et al., 2013).

Collaborative Inquiry (CI) is an adapted thread of PD focused the specific context of the co-creation of children's technologies (Druin, 1999; Guha et al., 2013; Yip et al., 2013). It comprises three key aspects of a close research partnership with children, use of naturalistic methods to gather contextual data in-situ and the user of PD low-tech, craft based prototyping techniques to intergeneration participants communicate new ideas on a level playing field (Druin, 1999). A common PD concerns is that participants often struggle to articulate their needs in the process of design (Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1997), and thus CI identified the desirability for at least some of the young people involved in the process to have built competencies in the design processes involved previously (2013).

Uchidiuno and colleagues used CI to develop technology to help STEM learning informal family settings via the creation of the Science Everywhere application (Uchidiuno et al., 2017). In prototyping sessions they used extensive video recordings, participant observation via note taking and post session semi-structured interview with participants. The results highlight the role of empathising to open productive explorations of the context of the family learning environment and the value of offering guidance, particularly to parents, in terms of adopting collaborative roles to ensure equal participaton. They also found the iteration process of the design surfaced patters which helped to build knowledge of family learning roles and increase the bi-directional nature of helping relationships.

Discussion ----------

The purpose of this discussion section is to identify synergies and divergent approaches in the studies described above which may be productive to explore in the context of my future research on collaboration in family game making.

CRITIQUE of TECH FOCUS of MAKING

FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL, IMMEDIATE CREATIVITY HERE COMPARED TO A MORE GROUP APPROACH? HOW DOES ROQUES WORK FIT INTO THIS? SEE LATER CRITIQUE OF CUBAN ON COMPUTERS,

While there is compelling evidence for the appeal of tools for tinkering, we can argue that the selection of the materials, while still providing creative opportunities, guides participants towards certain outcomes. This argument is particularly strong in the case of "Making Kits" which have become a output of the broader maker movement. These kits can be bought as off the shelf products which have an aesthetic of backyard inventor, but which are predilected in terms of the possible outcomes, essentially providing a return to following instructions to create a predetermined product.

The white men issue of making needs to be addressed (Grenzfurthner and Schneider, 2009; Halverson and Sheridan, 2014).

The decontextualised focus on personal creativity and exploration of some programmes is more closely aligned with hobby based participatory culture.

Critique of Maker Movement as a product driven, out of a box approach as 'fatally flawed" over emphais on tools rather than processes, drawing on Cuban's (2003) critique of introduction of other technology into schools (Martin, 2015, p. 37).\ NOTE: there is exploration of this in the conclusion.

A similar decontextualisation of the underlying goals surrounding making and tinkering is identified in a review of literature on tinkering by Bevan and Vossoughi as misleading (2015, p. 40). While concepts of "innovation" and "global competiveness" which drive some STEM programmes can be seen as uncontroversial aids to economic development, different motives for STEM programmes are identified, some driven by an empowerment agenda, others semi-militarised (Vossoughi and Vakil, 2018).

ON COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION -- AND MESSY JOINS

PBL values authenticity of tasks and a framework to facilitate cooperative work, allocation by role often predisposes group work to a cooperative model rather than cocreation following Teasley.

How to square the potential of online collaborative communities with Teasleys' analysis of Cooperation vs collaboration which prioritises the value of real time collaboration. While the distinction between cooperation and collaboration is potentially useful in complexifying concepts, it should be noted that the process of working separately still requires collaboration at the point of integration, and is particularly valuable and trickly to manage compared to real-life, real-time collaboration.

ISSUE OF SCALE AND REPLICABILITY -- TOOL / SYSTEM DESIGN VS INTERVENTION

Resnick has more of a focus on designing the toolset so that it facilitates the creative process and encourages a frictionless journey around a design thinking inspired iterative spiral. Taps into a STEM pipeline funding?

Gee in the "affinity space" term also focuses on the affordances of a process which he separates from notions of communities, particularly communities of practice.

Roque makes a case for the unpicking of the supportive and collaborative roles that parents can play and for facilitators to bring these out in debriefs as an aid to build this capacity and awareness of family learning roles.

To return to the FCL design, while it was effective in terms of accessibility through the use of materials and non-digital activities to build confidence especially of parents more used to that process, we can see that it left researchers with questions about the effectiveness of the process to enable learning at home. Then non-replicability of the process can be compared the infinitely replicable informal process of hanging out line in the frame of Ito's online and social participation in informal communities.

This tension of focus and scaffolding vs the freedom and fuzzy nature of participatory culture is a hard one to square in family learning interventions. EXPLORED ABOVE?

In looking at the family context of tinkering in museams and comparing it to the more indepth approach of PD or critical making, is there something about the family context which lends itself to a more superficial approach, either in terms of time commitment, or a wish to avoid more sticky conversations about needs, values, prioritisation etc.

There is a tension between the advantages of open ended projects, and the crtiques of this approach which highlight that without support that collaboration is diffcult between learners and needs to be scaffolded with more structured activities, see for example, (Kirschner et al., 2006; Kollar et al., 2006)

COMPLEXITY OF PARENT -- CHILD ROLES IN EXPLORING TECH

A common rhetoric is of the internet and games as an online digital playground open to all to dive in and create. Prensky positions the parent as ignorant or even an obstacle to this process as indicated in the tite of one popular book "Don't bother me Mom, I'm learning". Such a simplistic view of a Digital Divide between parents and children is complexified by studies addressing the collaborative relationships in more detail.

While Correa (2015), explores the role of children as brokers of technology in family environments especially in low socio-economic families where parents access to technology is limited, other learning from Roque and Barron show a diversity and complexity of parent-child roles in a creative learning environment where tools which are new to both parties.

OVERCOMING THE BARRIERS TO COLLABORATION IN DIGITAL PROJECTS

ADD ITO ratios of participation and creation.

As generative activity is exposed the exception rather than norm, and even in generative communities, actually productive partnerships in communities like Scratch are extremely rare compared to false starts. Studies of the New Grounds site which has a similar aim of creating media collaborations, via collabs, showed a 80 percent failure rate of collaborative projects (Luther et al., 2010).

As such while the potential to explore an online element of sharing of work created is worth investigating, there is to some degree an element of faith in the power of such a community to galvanise social learning.

The extent to which the model of the self taught computer geek which is celebrated in studies on linux (Sefton-Green, 2013, p. 41).

PARTICIPATORY DESIGN BEYOND EMPATHY WITH END USERS

There is a school of PD intervention designers who see a process as a way to go beyond using empathy with the end user design of a better product. Instead their focus is to use this shift in perspective and focus on context and dynamics to build the critical thinking capacities of participants. Ratto, the ethical elements and process to uncover this.

EXPLORE METHODS OF STUDIES -- TOWARDS ACTIVITY THEORY

In their exploration of studies game making to enhance creativity (Eow et al., 2010, 2010; Kangas, 2010; Robertson and Nicholson, 2007), Earp and team find that the few studies carried out show the potential for creative thinking when student are given access to co-production processes and other tools to support creative thinking. The authors conclude that research methods to assess creativity and collaboration in the field of game making are lacking despite the very nature of roles involved of programming, artists and designer making game making inherently cooperative (2013).

**From Teasley and Kafai,** The lack of specific research around the detail of collaboration processes in game making identified in the introduction to this writing points to the need for more research in the areas of how learner maintain Joint Problem Spaces, and sustain each others motivation specifically in this field.

The work of Resnick focuses on the stories of participants and the diversity of the artefacts that they can and do make. The focus on accessible toolkits and a creative spiral process suggests frictionless and immediate creativity.

Ratto by contrast explores the critical process and the importance of building shared understanding of context, the ease of making and the focus on created artefacts is deprioritised. In fact the benef

Ratto maps three, non-linear phases of Critical Making, exploration of existing areas (texts or ideas), making prototypes to reductively map such ideas and finally reflection and exploration of ideas through the revision of prototypes. The author links the process to three key elements of constructionism the possibility for emotional dimension of learning, the importance of transitional objects

We can make a parallel between the conversations stages of critical making to the forms of discourse needed computer mediated learning Teasley, using the computer as a way of disambiguating language with reference to something more concrete on the screen.

Indeed there are wide parallels here between the different approaches covered in terms of the use of mediating language and tools to explore and construct meaning. Exploring the difference or the specifics of methodologies to explore underlying perspectives at this point can be helpful to inform the particular focus of my study.

What differences can be seen in the **methodologies used.** The methodologies vary from an analysis of the works created, productive output of online individuals collaborations, to case studies from workshop notes, to self reporting, detailed debriefs. (Include examples here.)

The granularity and immediacy of the methodologies used is of interest for this study. I worry also about the validity of the group debriefs in terms of the incentive for the participants to say things that are pleasing to the researchers. The value expressed by the adult participants in Roque's thesis study, saying that they came back because they felt that the facilitators values their presence is a testament to this.

By it's nature, the process of flow in creation and collaboration is something very of the moment. Very few of these studies give details about how collaboration in the moment is captured.

Video analysis and play back to participants therefore holds a lot of interest for me, to capture key moments of collaborative problems solving, inspiration, generative ideation and then to play them back to participants to gather more detail of what led them to that point could be yield very promising results.

What could best be investigated by this in the moment observation? Perhaps the trigger points for break through or new ideas. The use of language that had been built in previous activities is rich material.

The recording of the screen, and vocal interaction in relation to what is happening on the screen while coding games or making digital assets allows for a triangulation of physical actions, resultant screen and conversational reactions which may be illuminating in a way that simple transcripts or video camera capture would not.

What are the effects of collaboration on a text code document from more than one screen using the collaboration possibilities of concurrent document editing? Do these mitigate pair programming issues?

**Methods of interest for my study**

Evaluation of the different kinds of collaboration in the context of family learning. From the point of view of the practicality of methods to assess. The co-operation in projects, and the asynchronous work on collaboratively produced are less immediately useful in feeding back to the families than the immediate, in the moment creativity of maintaining a Joint Problems Space. There also appears to be less research into this area.

While the technologies used could facilitate an interesting study of asynchronous contributions to a text-code game over time, the target audience of families does not suit this kind of analysis. They are likely to be working in the same physical space. Also while online intra-family collaboration outside of the taught sessions would also be of interest, such approaches would require a high level of learner autonomy, which is not predicted or required for participation in the proposed programme.
