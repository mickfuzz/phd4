An overview of literature on Game Design

My proposed study is on the role of collaboration in digital game makingintergenerational learning contexts. It will therefore require anextensive exploration of the literature concerning game making inlearning, and where with a focus on young people. While my choice to usedigital games, specifically two-dimensional video games as a learningmedium ( a choice justified elsewhere in the study), does effect thefocus of the following exploration of concepts, many of them aretransferrable to non-digital mediums.

As explored in the introductory chapter and previous sections theframeworks of 21^st^ Century skills and Computational Thinking areprevalent in the literatureBrennanand Resnick, 2012; Earp et al., 2012; Grover and Pea, 2013; Wing, 2006).Following a situated learning approach many of these frameworks areintertwined with the tools linked in the studies. Despite, a widediversity in these frameworks and processes, key overarching concernscan be identified (see appendix). What follows is a review focusing thefollowing areas; developing critical literacies, creative designmethodologies, game play and mechanics as systems thinking.

Developing Critical Literacies

Much of the literature exploring literacies and games focuses on theplaying of games, rather than game making, as a medium well suited tothe development of active meaning making in keeping with aconstructivist and situated approach to learningGee,2003; Jenkins, 2008).

Following constructivist principles, we may imagine a higher potentialof game making compared to playing. However, while some authors can seethe value of studying the making games to address 21^st^ century skillsEarpet al., 2013), other advocates are keen to not prioritise making andthus devalue playing elements with an assumption that "to be a fullparticipant, one must alsoproduce."Salen,2007, p. 308).

Conceptual work that has been done around developing multiple literaciesapplies not just to playing but also making. The work of Buckingham andBurn on gaming literacies puts social and cultural context at heart ofthe process.Buckinghamand Burn, 2007). The summary of Critical Framing (Cope and Kalantzisp329) -- supported by Shaffer . Developing metalanguage .

They identify potential problems with the application of existingcritical media theory in terms of there being an over emphasis on .

In identifying that game complicate distinctions between making andconsuming literacies, their study looking to develop a framework on gamemaking literacies the authors explore dimensions of cultural, criticalgame literacies and then creative approaches.

The three-dialog model of game design literacy

Created to support the learning behind Gamestar Mechanic, draws on widedesign and new literacy litearature, with an aim to create somethingmore specific to aid analysis and assessment of literacies and languagepractice in area of making video games.

Material, Real player and Ideal playerGames,2008).

The real and ideal players reference the "virtual, real and projective"identities put forward by GeeGee,2003, p. 54).

Ideal player -- is a useful construct to aid design and helping thedesigner imagine the virtual player that the real player will projectthemselves into.

Materials components of games come with their own affordences that areoften complex,

This dialogue is important for the game or learning environment as partof **active meaning making**

This shift in perspective has parallels with the designing for othersprocess in next sectionKafaiet al., 1997; Owston et al., 2009).

Games Creative Design Process

\

In early work on Kafai identifies a convergence of previously separatedomains of design and learning theoriesKafai,1995). Specifically the increased focus on problem and project basedapproaches to learning mirror the challenged based nature of design.

Also emphasises social process Creation of objects to think with andshare

Games as a design. - summary of what is a game, and what are the designelements,

use of this in the playing of games -- but especially in the making

Salen covers high level work on games, rules, prototypesSalen,2007).

Also strong on describing design.

Salen outlines the reflection in action of Shoen, and the link ofprocess driven and reflective design approach.

The work of Roberston on Adventure Author required understanding of thecreative process stages to support each oneRobertsonand Nicholson, 2007). These are detailed as; exploration, ideageneration, game design, game implementation, game testing andevaluation.

These activities support wide range of skillsRobertson,2012).

The stages are drawn from a mix of design fields including generalcreative process support, commercial game design and software design.

The author recognise the tension between the utility if discreet stagesand the iterative nature of the process . The value of iteration is akey feature of the work of Schoen which appears throughout theliterature on learning and designSchon,1984).

There is a good overview of the benefits of design in descriptions ofthe learning in the computer clubhouse projectResnickand Rusk, 1996). While this is short of definition this exists in laterwork.

Iteration is also at the heard of Resnick's model for creative designwhich was created in parallel with the Scratch tool.Resnick,2008, 2007).

While this model applies not just to game making as wanted to extent toother tinkering media projects, it grew out of that domain.

The model draws on importance of sharing, a theme explored by Kafai andBurke in the study of community in book andKafaiand Burke, 2014).

Linking to wider model of computational thinking and applying to theareas of moldelling, game design and robotics, this white paper advancesa model of Use, Modify and CreateAllanet al., n.d.) .

Collaboration

We can argue that collaboration is another tool which is supported bythe design process, especially the team setting of priorities, peerreview process and giving and receiving feedback. We can draw on otherareas of project based approaches to support this assumption, while wecan and project that the same would be for game making, more studies areneeded. (based on Earp + Whittons sections)

Problems solving as a skill linked to design process (rather thansystems thinking?)

Here's a study specifically on decision making and problems solvingAkcaoglu,2014).

Systems analysis via game mechanics

Gee characterises systems thinking in video games as allowing analysisof \"relationships, not isolated events, facts, and skills"Gee,2013, p. 12).

In his work on the learning design of Gamestar Mechanic, Robert Torresidentifies a key skill as the ability to recognise when multiple,dynamic relationships exist within a systemForrester,2016).

Torres identies 4 main facets of systems thinking from literature,

His work combines a comprehensive break down of five systems thinkinginvolved in the creation of games with a strategy to communicate thesecore concepts using a framework incorporating the key elements of gamesnamely; space, rules, core mechanics, components and goalsTorres,n.d., p. 111).

This idea developed at 143-148

He advocates the use of these specialist terms in game creation workshopearly on , even the incorrect use of the these terms to builddevelopment of use in situ to as supported by the work of Hmelo2000).

In this work using Gamestar Mechanic, a purpose built, Torres and otherdesigners of the game brings the process of analysing and creating gamemechanics into the realm of a formal learning approach suitable of forformal eduction and after school environments.

This can be seen as an education manifestation of a wider desire todefine terms to evolve game design processes and culturesCostikyan,n.d.).

Game mechanics defined and explored ,Sicart,2008) A narrow definition of game mechanics would be core mechanics, awider one would be to incorporate rules and thus start to be synonymouswith systems analysis -- perhaps don't bother with this

Another study on deepening understanding and application of gamemechanics looked at children's understanding of game rules form playerand game perspectivesAdamsonet al., n.d.).

The effect of systems in a game is described as game play in this studywhich aims to explore game mechanics in video games in order to helpdesignersFABRICATORE,n.d.).

One of the more advanced designs exploring game play and mechanics isQuest to LearnTekinba≈ü,2011, p. 55). The key learning practices are on page 55 , some overlapwith design and meaning making but some elements first two are reallynovel.

Appendix A

What follow are notes on a quick review of some of the frameworks usedto categorise the game making learning, or the outcomes of studiesexploring the value of digital game making.

A wide literature review identified "seven distinct -- but closelyrelated -- classes: literacies & skill

sets, individual learning attributes, inclusion, pedagogy, socialissues, technology and curriculum."Earp,2015, p. 10).

Other frameworks of gaming literacies exist which have a wider focus oncritical approaches and multiple literacies as well as culturesA.Peppler and B. Kafai, 2009; Buckingham and Burn, 2007). These worksaimed to extend media literacy and production frameworks to thisemerging area.

We can look at the why games arguments of Hayes and Games in theirreview of tools and strategies as a frameworkHayesand Games, 2008). As Kafai and Burke point out their categorisation ofpurpose within 4 sets namely; learning programming, getting girls tocode, learning other subjects by proxy, understanding designing concepts-- is not exhaustive and overlaps, often expresslyBurkeand Kafai, n.d.).

Kafai uses a wider framework for looking at value of constructionistgames -- personal learning, social and culturalKafaiand Burke, 2015). While I can see the value of this encyclopedicappraoch to categorise existing studies, this seems too broad for thepurpose of this review.

What about the "rules, play and culture framework"Salenand Zimmerman, 2003, p. 4).

In this writing, we'll concentrate mostly on rules and play. They notethat the framework can be applied to wider contexts than game design.

Zimmerman later explores , systems, play and designPerronand Wolf, 2009). as gaming literacies,.

There are multiple areas to explore, in this review, given themotivation of developing 21^st^ Century skills, I have prioritised thefollowing;

-   developing critical literacies-   creative design processes-   game play and mechanics as systems thinking
