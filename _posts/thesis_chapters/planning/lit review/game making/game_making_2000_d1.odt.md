An overview of literature on Game Design

My proposed study is on the role of collaboration in digital game makingintergenerational learning contexts. While I have chosen to use digitalgames, specifically two-dimensional video games as a learning medium ( achoice justified elsewhere in the study), many associated concepts arealso applicable to non-digital games.

As explored in the introductory chapter and previous sections theframeworks of 21^st^ Century skills and Computational Thinking areprevalent in the literature justifying the use of gamemaking ineducationBrennanand Resnick, 2012; Earp et al., 2012; Grover and Pea, 2013; Wing, 2006).Despite a wide diversity in these frameworks and processes (see appendixA), key overarching concerns can be identified which I categorise as;developing critical literacies, creative design methodologies, game playand mechanics as systems thinking.

Developing Critical Literacies

Much of the literature exploring literacies and games focuses on theplaying of games, rather than game making. Games are show to be a mediumwell suited to the development of active meaning making in keeping witha constructivist and situated approach to learningGee,2003; Jenkins, 2008).

Is there a a higher educational potential of game making compared toplaying? While some authors do claim a greater value for game making toaddress 21^st^ century skillsEarpet al., 2013), other advocates are keen to not prioritise making andthus devalue playing elements with an assumption that "to be a fullparticipant, one must alsoproduce."Salen,2007, p. 308).

Conceptual work that applies the developing multiple literacies appliesnot just to playing but also making. The work of Buckingham and Burn ongaming literacies puts social and cultural context at heart of theprocessBuckinghamand Burn, 2007). In doing so they underline a concept central to widerunderstanding of new literacies, that the importance of critical framingof new knowledge in a way that transcends functional abilityCopeand Kalantzis, 2000). The idea of video games and related communicationhappening around the game as a frame which supports the development of ameta language is explore by Shaffer and colleaguesShaffer,2006; Shaffer et al., 2005).

However, Buckingham and Burn identify potential problems with theapplication of existing critical media theory in terms of there being anover emphasis on consumption of media rather than its creation. Inidentifying that games complicate distinctions between making andconsuming literacies, their study looks to develop a framework on gamemaking literacies which includes creative approaches.

In order to document and assess the kinds of literacies outlined aboveand specifically learning in the development of the software toolGamestar Mechanic, Games proposes a three-dialog model of gamingliteracies2008).Material literacies provide language to address the often complexaffordances of interrelated objects and system components of games, atopic covered on more depth later. The two other dialogues addressperspectives of the real and ideal game players. To inform this model,Games draws on conceptions of the "virtual, real and projective"identities in game playGee,2003, p. 54). The real identities of game players are lost to an extentas they attempt to play a virtual role. This transformation isincomplete and thus a merged, projected identity with elements of bothreal and virtual results.

In imagining the experience of the ideal player, the games designerbegins to addresses issues of interactivity and systems dynamics. Thedesigner will imagine the ideal players experience when testing the gamethemselves. Thus the ideal player is a useful design construct, helpingthe designer imagine the virtual player that the real player willproject themselves into. This shift in perspective has parallels withthe process of designing for others outlined in next sectionKafaiet al., 1997; Owston et al., 2009).

Finally, the real player dialogue comprises feedback from others in thetesting of the designed games. This vital stage begins the movement ofthe game into a wider social ecology. The interaction between designerand real player happens during the testing of game prototyping in aprocess know as play-testing. Again this is detailed in the nextsection.

Games Creative Design Process

\In early work exploring the educational potential of game making usingthe LOGO language, Kafai identifies increased convergence of thepreviously separate domains of design and learning theoriesKafai,1995). Increased interest in problem and project based approaches ineducation mirror the challenge/brief focused nature of design methods.

The importance of the process of design is covered in many foundationalstudies on game making. Salen highlights the value of prototypes in gamedesignSalen,2007). Both Salen and Kafai cite the influence on the field of theprocess of reflection in action and the value of iteration, both keyconcepts of the work of Schön1984).In this context, these concepts position the game maker a reflexiveindividual in a social context of a wider game making community.Supportive learning tools or environments support the creation ofon-going test designs which are given feedback and modified further inan iterative process.

The development of the Adventure Author 3D narrative game developmenttool prompted research to understand of the discreet stages of creativeprocessRobertsonand Nicholson, 2007). These are outlined by the authors as; exploration,idea generation, game design, game implementation, game testing andevaluation were drawn from a mix of design fields including generalcreative process support, commercial game design and software design.While analysis of these stages can yield important stages of processesincluding problem finding, problem-solving, evaluation, communicationand collaboration, there is also a recognition the tension between theutility of this presentation of the processes as discreet stages and theiterative, cyclical nature of the process.

Iteration is also at the heart of Resnick's model for creative designwhich was created in parallel with the Scratch tool.Resnick,2008, 2007). Graphical representation of this model explicitly referencethe creative, expanse spiral beginning and ending with Imagine, andfollowed by the stages of create, play, share and reflect.

Collaboration

Collaboration is supported by the design process. Indeed, it would behard to identify any part of the design process outlined above does notallow for collaboration. However, while we can draw on other studies ofproject-based approaches to support design processes which supportcollaborationBereiterand Scardamalia, 2000; Blumenfeld et al., 1991), Earp and colleaguesnote that studies in collaboration and game making are restricted to theareas of feeback via peer review2013).

The area I am most interested in for this study is collaboration in thecreation of elements of systems thinking. In video games this ismanifested in related concepts of game mechanics and game play. Theinterrelationship between these concepts and studies addressing them arecovered in the following section.

Systems analysis via game mechanics and game play

Gee characterises systems thinking in video games as an analysis of\"relationships, not isolated events, facts, and skills"Gee,2013, p. 12). As part of foundational theory to support the design ofGamestar Mechanic (GSM), Torres identies four main aspects ofunderstanding of systems thinking from the literature; the ability torecognise when multiple dynamic relationships exist within a system,identification of feedback loops, analysis of the quality of systemlinkages and the ability to identify similar systems in other domainsTorres,2009).

In the design of GSM, Torres and other designers of the game translatethe process of analysing and creating game mechanics into a learningapproach suitable of for formal eduction and after school environments.Foundational systems thinking concepts are simplified into a frameworkconsisting of the key elements of games namely; space, rules, coremechanics, components and goals.

Torres advocates the use of specialist terms in game creation workshopearly on, even the incorrect use of the these terms to build developmentof use in-situ to as supported by the work of Hmelo2000).This can be seen as a manifestation within education of a wider desireto define terms of game design as a means to facilitate evolution ofassociated processes and culturesCostikyan,2002).

One of the elements common to these discussions is that of *gamemechanics.* While a broad definition of game mechanics may cover manyelements of game play. Sicart finds a more exact definition of gamemechanics which excludes elements of rules and player challenges andfocuses more on mechanics as key actions that can be carried out byplayers in a gameplay contextSicart,2008).

FollowingJärvinen,2007), the best way of understanding mechanics as methods is toformalize them as verbs, with other syntactical/structural elements,such as rules, having influence on how those verbs act in the game.

Fabricatore expands the understanding and potential modifications ofgame mechanics in relation to gameplay in a study aimed at gamedesigners2007).Prioritising the user perspective, he outlines the beneficial effect ofreusing and modifying core mechanics to additional purposes. The userthen feels justified in the effort of learning one mechanic as it theserves other purposes.

To bring this discussion back to the perspective for learners learningto design video games, while it may be tempting to focus on moresimplistic tasks of the game making process. We can justify theintroduction of more complex concepts to improve user perceptions of thevalue of their own game by making it better. Indeed studies highlightthe desire for young people to make the games they create better asplayable gamesMaloneyet al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2013). However, while these studies focuson learning of computational processes learned through the making ofgames, empirical studies looking at game making to promote systemsthinking are rarer.

One notable exception is the work to promote and assess game designgeneration is the Quest to Learn programmeTekinbaşet al., 2010). The "key learning practices" including systems thinking,which integrates some of above work of Torres, and 'play design', whichprovides a social and structured feedback process to evolve systemsdesign thinking linked to the creation of video games. While assessmentof these elements has been integrated into a curricular model, morestudies along these lines would be very welcome to support the findingsShuteand Torres, 2012).

Appendix A

What follow are notes on a quick review of some of the frameworks usedto categorise the game making learning, or the outcomes of studiesexploring the value of digital game making.

A wide literature review identified "seven distinct -- but closelyrelated -- classes: literacies & skill

sets, individual learning attributes, inclusion, pedagogy, socialissues, technology and curriculum."Earp,2015, p. 10).

Other frameworks of gaming literacies exist which have a wider focus oncritical approaches and multiple literacies as well as culturesA.Peppler and B. Kafai, 2009; Buckingham and Burn, 2007). These worksaimed to extend media literacy and production frameworks to thisemerging area.

We can look at the why games arguments of Hayes and Games in theirreview of tools and strategies as a frameworkHayesand Games, 2008). As Kafai and Burke point out their categorisation ofpurpose within 4 sets namely; learning programming, getting girls tocode, learning other subjects by proxy, understanding designing concepts-- is not exhaustive and overlaps, often expresslyBurkeand Kafai, n.d.).

Kafai uses a wider framework for looking at value of constructionistgames -- personal learning, social and culturalKafaiand Burke, 2015). While I can see the value of this encyclopedicappraoch to categorise existing studies, this seems too broad for thepurpose of this review.

What about the "rules, play and culture framework"Salenand Zimmerman, 2003, p. 4).

In this writing, we'll concentrate mostly on rules and play. They notethat the framework can be applied to wider contexts than game design.

Zimmerman later explores , systems, play and designPerronand Wolf, 2009). as gaming literacies,.

There are multiple areas to explore, in this review, given themotivation of developing 21^st^ Century skills, I have prioritised thefollowing;

-   developing critical literacies-   creative design processes-   game play and mechanics as systems thinking
