Game Making Origins Stories===========================

Introduction------------

This writing traces the foundations and various influence of currentlandscape of games and education.

Debates surrounding DGBL

Sigurdardottir,2012) Highlights various debates in DGBL; age as a factor for DGBLparticipants, is play motivating or not ( can be sidestepped easily) &use of COTS or bespoke learning games. These issues will be explored butnot in isolation but with the use of frames outlining variousapproaches.

Framing Terms

Framing (rather than defining -- seeMayer,2012)) terms and how and who uses them can help bring to the foregrounddifferent schools and the assumptions behind them.

Inspired by the approach of the Platform Studies series of books on theimpact of various video game platforms, I have found it useful to uselenses of culture, technology and economics in reviewing literature ofthis areaBogostand Montfort, 2018). While the following analysis has a primary focus onthe cultural motivations for the use of games in education, the examplesused show how technological and economic factors are intertwined withcultural motivations.

Overview of Context and Issues of DGBL--------------------------------------

Goals of DGBL

In a review of research on the outcomes of game based learning Connollynotes the diversity of aims and approachesConnollyet al., 2012).

A model advanced in a review of motivation cited three main areas oftargeted learning and behavioural outcomes for educational games, skillbased, cognitive (declarative, procedural, strategic), and affectiveGarriset al., 2002). Connolly adopts this and extends it with additionalcognitive outcomes from other frameworks.

Categories used were as follows: knowledge acquisition/contentunderstanding, perceptual and cognitive skills, motor skills,physiological outcomes, affective and motivational outcomes, behaviourchange, soft skills and social outcomes.

What to do with this info?

**COTS vs Serious in a nutshell**

Define terms -- deFreitas -- through perpose

A review outlines purposes as games for entertainment, a games forlearning or a serious gamesConnollyet al., 2012). Two later terms often used synonymously by some but noteindustry simulation origins of SG. A later review reinforced thesynonymous use of the terms and subsequently disregarded as distinctionBoyleet al., 2016). This left two remaining categories, entertainment gamesand games for learning.

Eck in a review of DGBL divides approaches up into three areas; studentsbuild games from scratch, bespoke learning games designed byprofessionals and COTS commercial of the shelf games integrated intoclassroomsEck,2006).

New Literacies Focus: Game playing as situated learning-------------------------------------------------------

This school of approach is inspired by early work by Gee and Jenkins andthe work surrounding New Literacies schools.

This is wides in scope extending beyond explicitly educational games toenbrace wider ecologies and practices of game playing and modding.

Jenkins sees a faultline between motivations of game designers on theexperience of play with the educators concern for 'representing content'Freitasand Maharg, 2011, p. xxiv). Whilst not coming at this from a simplistic,dualistic viewpoint he notes the difficulty of translating the openended aims of good commercial games to a school environment whereeducational games start with prescribed aims and objectives. The dangerbeing that the play is crushed out of the games.

Many have pushed for the value of letting the play be play and seeingwhat learning comes of itIt≈ç,2010). This value of the associated meaning making in game playingcommunity activities often involving diy media production associatedwith it has been termed participatory culture and is explored more in alater section game makingJenkins,2009).

There is an attraction of large complex learning environments fornaturalistic researchersTaylor,2009). This approach is quite fluffy and certainly doesn't suitmeasurable outcomes rather than a study of learner experience.

Learning in COTS games is advocated especially in the context of complexgames that require a significant investment in player time. One exampleis outlined by Stewart of the use of strategy, media creation and mathsin 'crafting' practices in MMORGSFreitasand Maharg, 2011, p. 111). Stewart terms this learning Stealth Learningand describes it an unintended learning which is hard to quantify orpredict.

Digital Game Based Learning as Curriculum Training--------------------------------------------------

This sections explores games as a vehicle for more direct instruction oflearners. Where to best first contrast this?

Gee is still interested in this more direct approach as long as gameelements are well preserved. He uses a war simulations as an example ofgood practice in creating an effective instructional gameGee,2005).

We can also compare this use of the term stealth learning to the morequestionable use of it in in other contexts as a games as a sugar pillto trick learners into ingesting prescribed educational contentPrensky,2005). The authour describes a *Holy Grail* of making dull learningincluding the process of data retention more exciting.

This approach broadly summarises a school of thoughts surrounding DGBLwhich is characterised by a direct training based approach to knowledgetransmission, which includes Serious Games Movement and the use ofsimulations.

Simulations

From its industry training origins Serious Games have a tendency towardssimulations including health care, military, national policy budgetingDjaoutiet al., 2011; Michael and Chen, 2005; Sawyer and Smith, 2008).

The former of which has a higher propensity to be simulation based. DeFreitas in her introduction notes the longer history of simulations andasks are simulations games. De Freitas contends that while they havedifferent histories, roles and feedback mechanisms they are starting toconverveFreitasand Maharg, 2011, p. 3).

The goal is to represent reality.

They are often less immersive that COTS .

**Serious Games as Economy**

It is easy to be sceptical of commercial market based drive. But thereare many contextual factors that can't be ignored that presentopportunities beyond commercial exploitation including the appropriationof hardware or market mechanics for other purposesSawyerand Smith, 2008).

There is a tendency to over evangelise the effectiveness of thisapproach. In a report by the Serious Games Initiative they marvel thatat the same time as the emergence of many wicked or messy problems thesolution comes in "paradoxically in a package that could hardly havelooked neater"Tucker,2012, p. 2). Tucker here champions games as interactive systems whichmirror the systems of policy decision making. SGI game Budget Hero is anexample of this. The goal here is normally to leverage governmentfunding on key issues to create games based on medium of attention formillenials argument.

Measurement and Capitalist ideology in education

This study looks at the methodologies for measuring effectiveness andnotes a huge diversity in approachMayer,2012).

We can see the focus on measurement as a need for justification offunding allocation.

Educational Researchers Focus - Game playing as experience----------------------------------------------------------

If we can see one of the primary drives of the Serious Games Movement asproduction of software products which produce measurable learning, wecan contrast this with a school of educational researchers andpractitioners who focus more on the social and cultural aspects oflearner experience using gamesFreitasand Maharg, 2011).

Here the teacher can be seen as orchestrating learning experience. Thisfocus thus widens to include the learning ecology around the game ratherthan the game as a self contained product.

This broader focus and the hybrid possibilities it brings adds newelements into the discourse surrounding the use of games for learning.

To return to the issue of stealth learning as defined by Steward asunintentional learning, there exists the difficulty of translating thisapproach to formal schooling. In such environments with where aprescribed content is required by a curriculum driven approach, skilfulmatching of the game and outcome is essentialWhitton,2009). de Freitas2007,p. 8) cautions against inefficient use of games, advocating 'operatingfrom learning outcomes and objectives and not just being used as a breakin the learning'.

Educational games face practical problems of the cost and developmenttime of the computer games that they compete againstWhittonand Hollins, 2008). This results in limitations of the end product interms of productions values and negative perceptions of learnersJenkins,2002).

Modding is an alternative to be exploreddeFreitas, 2007).

Shaffer and epistemic games, moving the theory of Gee into a morestructured and supported environment. While an overlap with simulationexists here, the game making element is still strongShaffer,2006).

Motivational Claims Examined in Educational Context

One of the key ways this school is different from DBGL evangelists istheir more moderated approach to the issue of games as a motivationalfactor.

PrenskyPrensky,2005, 2001) - made the DGBL term popular as an enthusiast and advocate.While this enthusiasm was welcome in a hostile environment to videogames in particular certain of key ideas around digital natives concepthave been later evaluated by educational researchers and found wanting.Claims around types of learning needed by younger generations that haveyet to be supported by evidenceBennettet al., 2008; Helsper and Eynon, 2010).

The unqualified advocacy of the use of games as a motivational factorand vehicle for stealth learning is also challenged by researchersWhitton,2008, 2007). The study in question posits that while many learners see apotential value in games as part of a learning process, this is trueprimarily when they see the games in question as being the mosteffective way of learning specific material or skills.

Game Making-----------

Adult preparation for making computer games

There is a distinction between AAA games and more indy game makingcourses. The first would have a more vocational, industry focusedapproach learning a particular tool chain or industry definedspecialism, while the second approach can take a step back and explorewider concepts of game making that transcend particular mediums.

In terms of adult learning, we can look at game making courses to giveget a sense of what the foundational concepts are.

MIT game making course gives overview of key texts that have acommonality to most areas. This would be Salen & Juul,

Also work of Jesse Schell.

This has influenced makers of educational packages to teach game makingtechniques. Gamestar Mechanic as an example, also developed by Salen

Some courses draw on resources of a have a more cultural slant. Somemore practical tools embracing past game theory and present practice ofprofessional game makers. The widening out of the study of video gametheory has lead to a renaissance in game theory in general.

While most adult courses a primary objective of making real games,(evenif making trash games, indy games), there is a wider set of objectivesfor game making programs for activities for young people.

Young people's computer game making activities

I've covered motivations in other writing (do a summary),

Here overlap with the maker movements and diy approaches and alsostraight-forward computing agenda

-   Engineering and design processes-   Understanding of game systems and mechanics-   Programming skills & computational thinking practices
