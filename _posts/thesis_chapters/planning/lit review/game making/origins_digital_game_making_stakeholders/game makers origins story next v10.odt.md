Threads of Digital Game Use in Education========================================

Introduction------------

This writing traces the foundations and various influences of currentlandscape of digital games and education. Inspired by the approach ofthe Platform Studies series of books on the impact of various video gameplatforms, I have found it useful to use lenses of culture, technologyand economics in reviewing literature of this areaBogostand Montfort, 2009). While the following analysis has a primary focus onthe cultural motivations for the use of games in education, the examplesof specific groups using or making games for learning illustrate howtechnological and economic factors are intertwined with culturaldrivers.

For brevity, I will use the term digital games based learning (DGBL) asan umbrella term. Eck divides DGBL approaches into three areas; studentsbuilding games from scratch, bespoke learning games designed byprofessionals and commercial-off-the-shelf games (COTS) integrated intoclassroomsEck,2006).

COTS games in this context are commercial-off-the-shelf games designedfor entertainment that educators integrate into learning experiences. DeFreitas2007)defines the distinction between COTS and serious games being that theprimary purpose of a serious game is to support formal learningoutcomes.

While a review of of digital games for learning or a serious gamesConnollyet al., 2012), includes a separate categories for serious games andsimulation (addressed later), a later review reinforced noted thesynonymous use of the terms and subsequently disregarded as distinctionBoyleet al., 2016).

Connolly's initial review notes the diversity of approaches and desiredoutcomes and represents them a model adapted from the work of Garris ancolleagues2002).The model consists of three main of targeted learning and behaviouraloutcomes for educational games, namely; technical or motor skills,cognitive abilities (declarative, procedural, strategic), and affective/motivational outcomes. The author also highlights the limitations ofthis categorisation and a more general lack of an existing unifiedapproach to measurement of the outcomes of game based learning andrecommends more research in this area.

Mayer2012))notes the complex use of terminology in the area of digital games andsuggests a framing, rather than definition, of terms to allow for anon-exclusive methods of giving context to meaning dependant on thesub-communities that use them. Here I use framing of loosely associatedschools of thought to bring to the foreground their preoccupations andassociated tensions in their use of digital games. These schools are thestudy of digital games in a literacy context, games as commerciallearning products and games as a focus for educational researchers andpractitioners.

Game playing as a new form of literacy ---------------------------------------

This school of approach is inspired by pioneering work by Gee and theNew Literacies movement. Gee was inspired by the complex learning oflanguage and other discourses that young people were engaging in byplaying video games. Discourses in this New Literacy context cancomprise a wide variety of communication forms to include "theburgeoning variety of text forms associated with information andmultimedia technologies"TheNew London Group, 1996, p. 61). In the context of computer games this isparticularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements whichmay including online play or internet forums which containconversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis,live chat possibilities and so on.

Gee also identified certain types of COTS games (including MMORGS --Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplay Games) which are complex, requirea significant investment in player time and are rich in learningpotential. Stewart outlines research which shows the development ofstrategy, media creation and maths in "crafting practices" in MMORGS2011,p. 111). Stewart terms this learning "Stealth Learning" and describes itan unintended learning which is hard to quantify or predict.

There is an attraction of large complex learning environments fornaturalistic researchers allowing a focus is on the representation ofthe complexity of the learner experience and environment rather than onmeasurable learning outcomes. Issues of interest include; playerparticipation in game ecologies, gender and game preferences and virtualeconomies in gamesBurke,2018; Carr, 2005; Humphreys, 2011), For a more complete summary seeTaylor,2009).

Itō documents the value of the informal nature of digital explorationsand identify play, and researched the resulting learning outcomesItō,2010). The diy media production and other meaning making in game playingcommunities is included in what been termed participatory cultureJenkins,2009). An increasing number of study explore such participation incomputer games in a context of wider digital media literacy skillsBuckinghamet al., 2005).

Digital games as bespoke educational products---------------------------------------------

To use games in formal education where a prescribed content is requiredby a curriculum driven approach, skilful matching of game and outcome isessentialWhitton,2009). De Freitas2007,p. 8) cautions against inefficient use of games, advocating 'operatingfrom learning outcomes and objectives and not just being used as a breakin the learning'. This approach often necessitates the creation ofeducational or serious games from scratch.

Jenkins2011,p. xxiv) describes a faultline between motivations of game designers,focused on the experience of play with the educator's concern for*representing content*. He also notes the difficulty of translating theopen ended aims of COTS games into prescribed serious games. The dangerbeing that the *play is crushed out* of the games.

At their most simplistic level serious games are presented as sugarpills, tricking learners into ingesting educational content by stealth.Instructional game designers chase a *Holy Grail* of making dulllearning including the process of data retention more excitingPrensky,2005). Critics of this approach highlight the lower level pedagogicalapproach of the majority of DGBL products which favour informationrecall activities bolted on to entertainment gamesEck,2006; Squire, 2006). Squire recommends the approach of *endogenous*games where context is intrinsic to game play as opposed to *exogenous*games where the learning context has nothing to do with the game.

Researchers interested in the use of open-ended and unintentionallearning in games are not necessarily hostile to the use of games formore formal learning outcomes. Many authours highlight the potential forserious games and simulations to surpass drill and practice approachesand to facilitate higher learning levelsEck,2006; Gee, 2003; Whitton, 2009). Gee advocates the creation ofeducational games as long as game elements are well preserved, using warsimulations as examples of good practice in creating effectiveinstructional gamesGee,2005).

Simulations

Simulations are a particular subset of serious games that deserve adiscreet description. Simulations as industry training activitiespredate the use of digital games and have origins in the areas of healthcare, military, national policy budgetingDjaoutiet al., 2011; Michael and Chen, 2005; Sawyer and Smith, 2008).

De Freitas notes particular characteristics of games2011,p. 3). The goal is to represent reality as closely as possible. They areoften less immersive that COTS games. As to the question are simulationsgames, the author observes that that while simulations and games theyhave different histories, roles and feedback mechanisms the genres arestarting to converge.

**Serious Games Movement **

While a detailed review of the many subtypes of serious games andrelated research is beyond the scope of this writing (for a review seeConnollyet al., 2012)) , it is useful exploring the surrounding ecology of gamemakers, researchers and other serious game advocates commonly referredto as the Serious Game Movement.

The involvement of researchers as designers, foundation activeprotagonists in the Movement is problematic. While Sawyer and Smith2008)identify legitimate contextual factors that present opportunities foreducators to appropriate existing gaming hardware and market mechanics,it is sensible to remain sceptical of unsubstantiated claims from aresearch ecology which benefits from the ongoing production ofeducational software.

To give an example, there is a tendency to over evangelise theeffectiveness of this approach. In a report by the Serious GamesInitiative (SGI) , Tucker marvels that at the same time as the emergenceof many "messy", complex global problems the solution (ie DGBL) comes"paradoxically in a package that could hardly have looked neater"2012,p. 2). Tucker here champions games as interactive systems which mirrorthe systems of policy decision making. SGI game Budget Hero is anexample of this. The goal of such reports is in part to leveragegovernment funding allocated to educational programmes on key issues tocreate serious games.

One particular area of the Serious Games Movement which has particularissues with concerning measurement of effect is that of Games forChange. Designers like Mc Gonnigal sees great potential for socialchange in gamesMcGonigal,2011). The laudable ambition to create games which can create a*measurable difference in the present state of reality*McGonigal,2007).

As a counterpart to the more general move towards performance indicatorsin education driven by market ideologyApple,2001), we can see impact evaluation in funded social change projects asa discourse directed by funding organisationsGertleret al., 2016). The focus on measurement which is part of the seriousgames and games for change as a need for justification of fundingallocation.

Mayer's study looking at the methodologies for measuring effectivenessand notes a huge diversity in approachMayer,2012). Pre- and post- tests are one of the most common forms ofmeasuring individual learning from games but such approaches are limitedand problematicWhitton,2014). Measuring wider social change is more complex and thus moreproblematic. In this light Mc Gonigal's aspirations seem to project farbeyond current capabilities in the field.

It is legitimate to question the process of measurement of learnerimpact of such programmes. Specifically, does a focus on designing formeasurable outcomes in the serious games movement create a tendency toselect easy to measure outcomes and thus address lower order learning?After conversations with some in the games for change world, I suspectthat in many cases it does. In any case, it is clear research in thearea of impact needs further development and to be conducted byresearchers with less potential bias

Game playing as broader educational experience----------------------------------------------

If we can see one of the primary drives of the Serious Games Movement asproduction of software products which produce measurable learning, wecan contrast this with a school of educational researchers andpractitioners who focus more on the social and cultural aspects oflearner experience using gamesFreitasand Maharg, 2011). Here teachers can be seen as facilitators activelyorchestrating a learning experience. The focus of attention widens toinclude the learning ecology around the game rather than the game as aself contained product.

This broader focus brings adds new elements and issues into thediscourse surrounding the use of games for learning. These include;strategies for addressing cost implications of serious gamesdevelopment, exploration of learning happening around the gameactivities and more measured approaches to measuring learner outcomesand motivation.

Educational games face practical problems of the cost and developmenttime of the computer games that they compete againstWhittonand Hollins, 2008). This results in limitations of the end product interms of productions values and negative perceptions of learnersJenkins,2002). Several strategies have been advocated to address this issue.

De Freitas2007)advocatesthe modification (modding) of existing COTS games as a practical way tofacilitate the participation of education professionals in the design ofhigh quality, immersive game experiences and thus allow better mappingof game play to specific learning outcomes . A popular engine whichallows this is Neverwinter Nights. Francis outlines a promising studywhich mods Neverwinter Nights to explore historical events of theAmerican Revolution from a "first personperspective'"2011,p. 87)

Whitton2012)promotes the use of several strategies to address the cost barriers ofusing COTS games or commissioning bespoke educational software includingthe use of alternative reality games, designing learning experienceswith existing virtual worlds and game building using free game engines.

There is a rich area of study involving collaborative game making,playful learning approaches and use of game like design techniques toenhance non-digital learning environments which is of great interest butbeyond what I can cover here.

This framing of the approach of educational researchers andpractitioners can be contrasted from that of serious games evangelistsin terms of a more moderated assessment of innovative practicesurrounding games and the role of games as a motivational factor.

Prensky2001)proposed the term Digital Game-Based Learning in a book of the samename. While this enthusiasm and advocacy was understandable as areaction to hostility video gamesSquire,2002), certain of key ideas advanced have been critiqued by laterstudies.

The idea that digital natives made up of younger gernations brought upwith information technology require different types of learning inputhave yet to be supported by wider evidenceBennettet al., 2008; Helsper and Eynon, 2010).

The unqualified advocacy of the use of games as a motivational factorand vehicle for stealth learning is also challenged by researchersWhitton,2008, 2007). The study in question posits that while many learners see apotential value in games as part of a learning process, this is trueprimarily when they see the games in question as being the mosteffective way of learning specific material or skills.

Another area of interest to educators is the learning activities thathappens around digital games, especially those which to promote higherlevel learning such as reflection & analysis. This focus on innovativepre- and post- game environment and activities allows a more adaptiveapproach when it comes to educators integration of COTS games intoclassrooms to support formal learning objectivesEck,2006). The shifting between real and virtual activities and thepossibilities for multimodal and plural (as opposed to as set order)learner pathways and experiences offers new opportunities and challengesto learning designersdeFreitas and Neumann, 2009).
