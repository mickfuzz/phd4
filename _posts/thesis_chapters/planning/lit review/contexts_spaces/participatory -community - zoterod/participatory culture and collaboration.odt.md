Participatory Culture and Making around the Game ------------------------------------------------

David gauntlet and DIY making, making as a way to pause for thought before answering or discussing, particularly of interest in terms of methods here Gauntlett, 2007). Areas for accessibility here too.

Gauntlett celebrates a rich history of making as an empowering activity, drawing on the ethos of William Morris and broadening the scope of to include as "everyday creativity" that encompasses self made internet creations which are shared on internet sites such as YouTube, Flickr and other sharing platforms often refered to as Web 2.0 platforms.

Studies on game playing explore the value of linked creative activities that promote creative reflection through the creation and sharing of artefacts. (link to mulitliteracies)

In the context of computer games this is particularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements which may including online play or internet forums which contain conversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis, live chat possibilities and so on.

There have been attempts to design learning environments which support the acquisition of these related skills through engagement with addiscratchtional activities around the game (have there? where?). Gee refers to this as metagaming, (where?)

Pioneering studies on metagaming activities (Torbin & Turkle) see Francis, 2006). Torbin, son managing a game site,

Diy media production and other meaning making in game playing communities are included in what been termed participatory culture Jenkins, 2009).

It may be worth exploring the difference between the terms Jenkins, 2018). As Gee makes a distinction between the value of connections and participation in of themselves in PC, and a more designed, structured "space" that has its own affordences of affinity spaces. This is relevant in a background of more right wing participatory culture which differs from earlier left wing prevalence of early PC years.

We can draw on Jenkin's exploration of the subject to explain why although these world of participatory culture is often driven by the interests of young people, a lassez faire approach is not viable for three reasons, the participation gap, transparency issues due to lack of reflective skills and issues surrounding ethical fluency and literacies 2009, p. 15).

Itō and colleagues used ethography methods to study informal digital explorations and identify play, and researches the resulting learning outcomes Itō, 2009; Itō et al., 2010). Their studies expose a differentiation between, hanging out, messing around and geeking out. Young people are primarily spending time online socially, whereas the remixing or other immediate forms of generative work are less common, and geeking out representing a more specialised production activity helped by a particular community of practice.

A key finding here is inequality of access. But What is Ito's conclusions?

The importance of that sharing has been highlighted in face of platforms that only allow creation as opposed to sharing and interaction around creation Grimes and Fields, 2015).
