Background in simulation?

No, separate out contextual info from the key themes of the lit reviewwhich should draw on bodies of research directly tied to the researchquestions.

Eg,

-   Similarities and differences in game playing and making    > educationally, gee, Schaffer, papert, turtle, pbl,

-   Grand theory on understanding game design, and components

-   use of game systems as a pedagogic tool in specific studies

**Grand theory on game design **

In Torres,

Design theory in general is worth exploring for following elements .

-   Donald Sheon and iterative nature of process,

<!-- -->

-   Salem, on interaction of design and learning 2007

-   Design poses problems, thus link to pbl

**Similarities and differences in game playing and making educationally,gee, Schaffer, papert, turtle**

In Torres lit review,

Epistemically, situated nature of learning symbols and behaviours ingames, playing as gateway to making. Must decode before creating, orcommenting

Pbl, as above, with a focus on collaboration, as one of the key tools.

**Collaboration as key design problem**

The process of making a game is complex and even as an individual mayinvolve blind alleys, as a group fiendish.

Thus there is a challenge for educators and participants to solvetogether.

Can draw in literature of open source and, forking, and communicativestrategies. How to bring parts of this into family learning?

One area, is the use of game mechanics as a framework for collaboration,ie some one working on the space, someone on the mechanics someone onthe components.

**Systems Literacies and video games**

Games provide a rich set of interacting tools for designers, audio,images, video, haptic - This allows concepts to be communicated in verydifferent ways to texts .

**Background on Game Making **

From notes of Kafai

or the first accounts, see Kafai 1995, 2006. For more comprehensiveoverviews on different efforts in constructionist gaming, see Kafai andBurke 2015; Earp 2015; Hayes and Games 2008. Jill Denner and ShannonCampe (2013) are currently conducting a more extensive and systematicsynthesis of research on making games for learning, funded by a grant bythe National Science Foundation (\#1252276).
