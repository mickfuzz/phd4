Later in this article explores cybernetics as a mechanism cognitively - autoregulation / equilibrium.

Also as nativist?

Je m'en fou de la reality

A focus on the the development of useful knowledge , epistemology rather than ontological questions.

Positioning\* between empirical study and apriori, nativist concerns.

Kant looked at at lot of similar material.

Learning thus has a complicated position, not simple empirical hoovering of a positivist world nor simple assimilation into nativist structures, or

The under lying structures actively construct world views.

These structures mutate when faced with data that consistently can't be assimilated.

Piaget is not immediately clear how his universal stages are not an unfurling of apriori structures, but this position of stages is consistently maintained as a baseline in his work, and leads the authors to describe this position as logical determinism.

The other factors making up his position of genetic epistemology are , interactionism, constructivism and finally logical determinism (xxxviii)

Interactionism is a mostly Ono controversial term indicating that learning happens neither solely from external factors or internal information, there is a stimulus response interaction provoking learning.

Or conversely, the actor seeks experiences in the real world that test or expand existing current sctructures , as Piaget sees it. A more active lens.

Construction of reality, is an ongoing process using evolving interpretational structures.

Structures that while not innate are universal.

The logical determinism, describes why the stages are universal, as the underlying structures follow logical pattern one following the other.

This can be contrasted with a more progressive US Dewen view, that's less structured/
