**Constructivism - Key Concepts - Review**

From Duffy in Whitton

1.  Situated cognition -- individuals' understandings are developed by    > interactions with their environment;

2.  Cognitive puzzlement -- cognitive conflict or puzzlement is the    > stimulus for learning

3.  Social collaboration -- knowledge evolves through social negotiation

Dunlap & Grabinger, 1996; Savery & Duffy, 1996.

These principles include:

\(1) learning is an active process of meaning-making gained from ourexperiences and interactions with the world;

\(2) learning opportunities arise as people encounter situations thatinvolve cognitive conflict, challenge, and through plannedproblem-solving;

\(3) learning is a social activity which in-volves acts of collaboration,negotiation, and participation;

\(4) reflection, assessment, and feedback are embedded within learningactivities; and

\(5) learners take primary responsibility for their learning.

**Three main characteristics**

The first characteristic of constructivism is the notion that knowledgeis not a product to be accumulated but an **active and evolvingprocess** in which the learner attempts to make sense out of the world

The second characteristic is the notion that people conditionalize theirknowledge in

personal ways (Gurney, 1989). T**hat is, they acquire knowledge in formsthat enable them**

**to use that knowledge later. **

The third major characteristic of constructivism is the importance o**fcollaboration and**

**social negotiation of meaning.** Learning happens within a socialcontext. Conceptual

growth comes from sharing our perspectives and testing our ideas withothers, modifying

our internal representations in response to that process of negotiation(Bednar et al,

1991). Common understandings and shared meanings are developed throughinteraction

among peers and teachers. This, is the cultural aspect of knowledge.
