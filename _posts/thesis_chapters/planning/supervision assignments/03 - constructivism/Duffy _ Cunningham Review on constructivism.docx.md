From **Constructivism: Implications for the design and delivery ofinstruction**

Everyone uses constructivism now a days and slags skinner, but whatreally is the difference between instruction which takes place in acontext and more active" learning .

Concerns about constructivism, that it leads to subjectivism, Brunerwould reject this arguing for viability as a more useful concept thanuniversal truth.

The difficulty of shared verses idiosyncratic meaning exists and issomething which is tested and probed as individuals test this.

And meaning is not assumed to be transmitted from expert to learner.

**Philosophy and constructivism**

**Vico**

**To know means to know how to make, **

Kuhn

Paradigm shift in science to best effort rather than truth seekers

Whittgenstein

Importance of context in meaning of language, deeper and deeper meaningas layers of interpretation interweave

Rorty

-   Viability as key concept rather than truth

-   Science as process for dialogic process towards solidarity

-   Knowledge vs opinion the same but with difference over levels of    > accord

**Looking at wider interpretations of constructivism **

Broad schools of individual focus, piaget, Von g,

And social, engestrom cole etc

Puzzlement, disequilibrium from piaget or perturbation from Dewey isindividual cause of learning,

Contrast to vygotsky, language as socially mediat3d tool to constructmeaning.

Collective action as on rogoff s learning communities is the focus,keywords are enculturation being brought into the fold, and individuallearning is seen in that context.

Cobb 1994 sees process as complimentary but the authors disagree.

**Importance of metaphors**

-   Mind as computer

-   Mind as brain, connectivism

-   Mind as rhizome, distributed

Rhizome mind has following characteristics,

-   Socially distributed, not just on one persons head, an open network

-   Any point can juxtaposition with another, chaotic, unstructured

-   Can rupture to creat new juxtaposition

-   No fixed points, only relations,

-   No hierarchy's

**Knowledge is constructed , learning is process of construction**

Concept of umwelt as a mix of individual, culture and environments.Distinct from environment.

Focus on creation of culture through , construction or semiosis, as theauthors prefer.

Cop as the best metaphor for ho w we learn here, picking up the lensesand culture of communities and thus constructing reality differentlyusing these tools.

**Many world views and perspectives**

Refutation of claims of naive relativism,

Individual takes on reality happen in a social context so are sociallynegotiated.

Or indeed not negotiated as we take on the views of those around us thatare in common use as a pragmatic response.

Only questioned when brought into focus when contrasted with opposingworld views.

THe authors celebrate this diversity inherent in the mar metaphor,suggested that it provokes an open mindset.

**Knowledge is context dependent so should happen in the relevantcontext**

This brings up the learning problem, how can learning be transferable ifsituated. Espe

Authors disagree.

The paradox continues, and has implications for teacher,

Vygotsky was mistranslated, knowledge is appropriated rather thaninternalised

But that does solve the learnin\* paradox.

**Learnin\* is mediated through tools and signs**

This is a fruitful area, more reading around this would be useful.

Going over semiotics basics, linking this with core vygotsky.

-   Tools , physical prototype

-   Symbols, abstract prototype

But these merge and straddle in Modern world. Think computers.

Semiotic systems mentioned by vygotsky are similar to multipleliteracies o& gardener, linguistic, musical, logical-mathemati-cal,spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal.

Different signs, and signifiers are present for each of the systemsabove, and probably dependent on context too.

There is a chicken and egg effect of these mediating objects, mancreates them for a purpose but their creation morphs what gets producedfinally.

Think hammer, angles in houses.

Thus there is a complexity in a learning process , involving, context,mediational objects, humans impact on objects, and the concrete use ofobjects for specific tasks.

Key concepts in constructivism------------------------------

**Discovery learning**

Dewey, Bruner in design of a sociology curriculum,

Focus on process and meta cognition rather than just content

Problem of misinterpretation, just teachers selected content.

**Zone of proximal development**

From zygotsky , definition is support of supportive adults and or morecapable peers,

Authors extend this in direction of cop , to include a full culturalcontext, as Cole says, "where culture meets cognition "

This impact is then reciprocated, creating a dynamic culture.

From perspective of a designer these communities are instructionaldesigns, although this broadens concept of instruction to beyondknowledge transmission.

**Scaffolding**

People or object affordences and cultural past in the environment tosupport knowledge construction

Not clear here if this is from vygotsky or other.

Potential problematic , teaching centric view of the structure of thescaffold created could presuppose the type of learning taking place.

**Cognitive apprenticeship **

From resnick and brown palinscar, especially reciprocal learning.

While supportin\* the focus on authentic environments and tasks, theycaution a master apprentice relationship as model, as potentiallyforegrounding a individual transmission focus.

Instead they support the peripheral involvement model of CoP.

Thus even small roles are valuable and reciprocal , and the focus on thewhole culture, and all mediating objects decentres the master from theprocess.

**Coaching**

Danger that shift to a guide on the side will only be a shift of methodsnot underlying ethos of expert in control of direction

This is compared to mentoring, fosnot

Which honours the view and direction of the student

**Context**

Context is complicated

**Learner control**

Seems specific or emergent from computer centred instruction design

Not explored in debatable but contrasted to teacher , computer control
