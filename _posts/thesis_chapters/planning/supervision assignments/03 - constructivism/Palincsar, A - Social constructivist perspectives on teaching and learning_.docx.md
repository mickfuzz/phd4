Palincsar, A. (1998). Social constructivist perspectives on teaching and learning.

progression from behavourism to Bruner / congnitive revolution

Cognitive approaches most involve some form of constructivism

Spectrum from indivi difference in constructive in interpreting realitivy ←\> to radical constructivism

Covers Piaget - Conflict and Dequilibrium

Also testing peer interaction in conservation theory

Covers Vygotsky -

Critique - internalisation as a transfer of knowledge model

Leontiev refutes this, process of internalisation is constructive

Wertch outlines three themes in V

1.  Interdependence of learning and development - critique of Piaget -     > and ZPD to illustrate this

2.  And use of tools and mediation, semiotic tools and physical     > artefacts, from Voices of the Mind

3.  Interplay of both is best studied in - Historical, evolutionary     > context, in process of change

The work of Vygotsky is then fragmented into 4 aspects

1.  Phylogienic - just human stuff, language, use of tools

2.  Cultural/ historial - over time, communities of practice

3.  Onotogenetic - individual characteristics influencing development

4.  Microgenetic - interaction of individual and environment

Then different locii of analysis

1.  Institutional analysis

2.  Discourse analysis

**Then application to contemporary education**

Broad in process

-   Transfer - expertise across domains

-   Assessment

-   Meaningful context
