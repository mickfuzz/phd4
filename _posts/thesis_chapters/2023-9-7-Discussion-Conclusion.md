## 3M through the lens of agency

In previous chapters, we have looked at broad conceptions of agency in the emergence of learning communities.
In this section I analyse the experience of learners in this study using some of the concepts and techniques of achieving agency to find matches and divergences.

### TADS - interventions and affordances as double stimulation

Revisiting terms; The term intervention and affordances do not nearly align with the broad conceptual framework of this study infering a duality between subject and object. FIND REFERENCE

Backwards and warping anchors.  

How does the process of offering out ledging points where anchors can catch, as a form of learning design match with conceptions of agency?

### Relational Agency - Edwards

Look at use of tools at the boundaries to construct new knowledge [cite - Building common knowledge at the boundaries between professional practices: Relational agency and relational expertise in systems of distributed expertise - Edwards]




## Synthesising the characteristics of the 3M pedagogy

3m This is a domain specific framework for teaching , can it have wider applications?  

If so how can characteristics be abstracted?

And if so are they distinct from existing frameworks explored in literature review?   

- Walled garden of limited design patterns
- Playful methods of community creation
- Drama narrative to create audience a la heathcote
- Regular informal feedback and chances to discuss evolving designs


### Agency, choice and practicalities

In PBL, UDL and other models - learner choice and building agency is shown to be of value in increasing engagement and ownership over learning. However, building the relevant knowledge to identify, agree on and implement game patterns from scratch takes time and without relevant scaffolding too so long that it negatively impacted motivation.

In a similar way to the play paradox [hoyles_pedagogy_1992], there is a tension between structure and freedom. However, the issue here relates to tensions between different forms of agency, instrumental, authorial and transformative.

### PROPOSAL Coding impact on design/ processes on learner agency - boiled down -

<!-- NOTE  I would say  too complex for coding -->

Answering RQ - on pedagogical resources / agency / use of GDPs

THIS IMAGINED FOR CONCLUSION BUT ALSO CODE TO IT? OR ABOVE?

- learners developing agency through personal expression of home and other Identities
- agency through choice over pathway via GDPS
- agency through flexible design cycle pathways, especially via community playtesting
- developing agency through celebration of different game maker styles
- authenticity of tool use, especially docs and access to Community
- authenticity of audience - and role of drama to facilitate reflection

This summary can be explored using conceptions of agency explored in previous chapters including instrumental, effortful and authorial agency. In particular the use of TADS and other conceptions of agency to shed light on the role of the designer /facilitator can be highlighted at this point.

#### Metaphors around creating space

The title to this chapter was  _Seeding Game Making Communities to Facilitate Learner Agency_. This evolved to _Seeding and Nurturing Game Making Communities to Facilitate Learner Agency_. It could be extended to _Rewilding_ metaphor to reflect the importance of leaving learners to evolve their own processes as a form of authorial and transformational agency, albeit within the forms of pedagogical walled gardens explored in this chapter. The growing /agricultural metaphor can be compared with the metaphor for agency used in the discussion which is more nautical in flavour, led by Sannino's work on TADS and kedging anchor metaphor which is extended to incorporate a protected habour for novices in a creative environment. Similarly in the literature there is a thread around play-spaces and playgrounds. One common thread here is the importance of a sheltered learning environment and somewhat curated set of affordances.

The process of Playtesting and working towards an external audience.

Some of the processes for building community were more mutual - collecting requirements

Creating documentation
Other processess

Of course this may make learners run into trouble if engaging outside of the harbour or in real situtations.

#### Game design to understanding games as a design artefact for empowerment purposes - PERHAPS GOOD FOR CONCLUSION.

Bruno advocates process that expose that are surrounded by designed objects. This process of making lifts the lid on that process.

See example between helper and Pa in 2019-03-18 at the end. "It makes you think" . They marvel at the complexity of code needed to create even a simple game.

The motivation to allow participants to get under the hood of new technology is a foundation of many technical programs built on empowerment. We can take Mozilla, mouse, etc.

It is also present in design programs which take care to convey ethical perspectives as part of the design process as a way to counteract the possible effects of unindended side effects. This is especially relevant in the age of big data and highly powerful corporations.

Yet this approach is not without critique.

"Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.‚Äù  Friedrich Nietzsche

This expression, conveys a perspective that the medium is the message. By engaging with the technology its influences may permeate the subject.

This raises an additional question.
How can we help learners build agency in technological environmental without becoming monsters.


### Design patterns as a teaching aid / set of affordances in informal vs formal environments

TO DEVELOP OR MOVE back TO GDP CHAPTER

See journal notes and contrast with existing research with GDP and informal / formal coding programming debates.
Asking what does this research add to these debates?

Some of the following may be relevant;

- Learner choice and levels of abstraction techniques
- From the literature what are complexities involving the practitioner practicalities surrounding creating communities of coders
- What is special about the use of GDP in this 3M model?
- How is this model different from Game Jams in particular.
- Whereas Game Jams focus on x, 3m has a focus on y.
- Exploring GDP and different kinds of types of coding errors?

### Game Design Patterns vs CT and more established "knowledge"

My end design highlights game patterns as a starting point for user interest and to draw participants in to other elements of learning dimensions. More abstract dimensions like systems thinking, and more concrete like coding concepts.

- Compare formal teaching of CT and CS with an approach based on a freer choice of patterns.
- Discuss the use of gdps as a gateway to other concepts as explored in CS in a more abstract, and more concrete direction [@eriksson_using_2019] .

- Leading with GDP as a way to explore other Learning Dimensions
<!-- Draw on discussion in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1D-VhVj-NgN3qgk3YEx4HZEozf_1UOGtE -->

- Discussion - The use of GDPs hits a sweet spot as a "middle" level construct, (see Eriksson and Bjork)
- Discussion -  Rising to the concrete - as a key AT concept - how does this fit?




#### GDP, CT & Transfer
The heart of the matter here is how transferable knowledge is without a contextual meaning attached.  This is a contested area.
Firstly how wide should reuse be imagined? To other coding projects? Or wider claims as with Wing's interpretation of CT.

#### Technical of 3M concepts suiting transfer

Learning maps - additional discussion on learning dimensions - or conclusion / next steps.

While there are technical elements of transfer that were identified and included in the learning map I sidelined the study of them.

Specifically in examining the concrete implementation of GDPs there are transferrable concepts and practice involving practice which include;

- Use of levels as a array which is parsed by a loop to create layout
- Logic statements of varied degrees of complexity
- Functions - code patching into the right area



### Commentary of CT in the 3M model in particular

Brief commentary on discussion  on the practical value of CT concepts

NOTE - Shift some material here from previous chapter.

Developing understanding of CT concepts in isolation is a potentially weak point of the 3M approach in comparison to from first principles approach. However the process of patching into different areas of the code and creating functions does address this. The following transcript of Sh's interaction with myself shows that the process of copying patterns in the template code and patching in new lines from the supporting documentation gives ample opportunity for sequencing mistakes to be made. The process of working with students on their existing code is valuable to explain why and how the order of lines of code and when functions are called.

 The comparison raises a potential discussion point on what the practical value of this CT concept is.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses of the GDP construct / terminology

PERHAPS MOVE TO DESIGN?
The interpretation of GDP that this thesis adopts contains some weaknesses. The specificity of the term is weak in that in seeking to categorise a wide diversity of features that participants would want to add to the game to fulfil a pedagogical motivation of providing guidance and inspiration to the novice designers. The pragmatic nature of this interpretation can be contrasted to more formal definitions of say Game Mechanics related to user actions in the game [@sicart_defining_2008].

<!-- NOTE -  THIS CAN BE EXPANDED
more n Game Mechanics etc
-->
The term is particularly week in the area of Game Polish which involved were more aesthetic and narrative choices.

[]

These choices do not fall neatly in to the argument being constructed around the potential of GDPs to unlock repeatable, transferable practices. For example, some participants, specifically one who came as a friend of of others and didn't have direct parental help, spent a majority of time working on these patterns especially if assets are being replaced.

It is perhaps the term _pattern_ that is problematic here. It may imply a repeatable structural element rather than an aesthetic choices. Other academics have given a wider name of game elements [@tekinbas_gaming_2014] or lenses [@schell_art_2008].

#### On CTs and CTs emerging in the wild.

As explored in a previous chapter, the 3M design leads with concrete game design patterns chosen by participants. This approach can be compared to others which lead with more abstract computational thinking concepts which are introduced and explicitly taught from first principles.

However, while not explicitly taught, the CT concepts are contained within the learning dimensions of the 3M model allowing participants and especially facilitators to be aware of examples of practice allowing for development of these skills. This section explores examples of CT in action that emerge from video data of game making.  

NOTE - A quick summary of examples?


##### Compare formal teaching of CT and CS with an approach based on a freer choice of patterns.

The design choice of leading with GDP was based on increasing the agency of participants over the pathway of their design activities.
LINK TO LITERATURE ON CHOICE AND ENGAGEMENT.

It is problematic to compare participants engagement with this learning design with another fictional game where they learn CT concepts first and then put them into practice.

However, it is helpful to identify key characteristics of the design which run counter to a principles first approach and describe how participants experienced these elements.

Elements of contrast with 3M include;

- The remix element of code (explored in previous methods chapter perhaps) - which allows participants to add new features quickly. They can also see and replicate existing patterns in the  code. This could compare to many hours writing from scratch and many abstract concepts explained before getting to anything looking like a game.
- Lack of value placed on CT as overarching knowledge. No posters, no curriculum content, no tests on concepts, no lesson objectives and end tests,
- Code patching from existing code examples, as previously explored, allows for participants to take code and add it into their game without full knowledge of the syntactical complexities of each line they use.


##  Recommendations / Commentary / Discussion on toolsets

Some of the recommendations that this research makes have already been implemented over the lifespan of the research which were not in place at the start of the process.

- Code playgrounds are now common and suggested by CS
- Make-code arcade has been created and adopted by educators.


###  Further recommendations regarding tools sets

However, here are some more possible directions.

JS is a fantastic but challenging tool but supporting  
P5 perhaps

##  Commentary / Discussion on Learning Dimensions

More discussion  on the practical value of CT concepts

### CT as a practical skill or a more abstract concept.

A general discussion of varied views and my own based on data of this study.

### It's fun but are they learning
Exploring the tactic of reflective practices to back up CTs being found in the wild. Both for practitioner and participants as per [@petrich_it_2013].


### Discussion on UMC and PRIMM in relation to use of 3M model (Practitioner focus)

- UMC - should also be covered in the Remix part of the design ?

<!-- not sure how much to put in about this in LIT REVIEW  -->
Note on PRIMM and personal knowledge.

Recap on PRIMM ? - THIS WILL BE IN LIT REVIEW MOST PROBABLY

Da and Te - In these interaction the parent seems keen for the child to be able to express and demonstrate their personal knowledge of coding, games and maths concepts.

This is an interaction which in some ways is comparable to the PRIMM model which is suggested for classroom use. However to do it in the way demonstrated by this pair would involve a level of coding familiarity, and ongoing familiarity with the structure and thinking of the participant which would be difficult to achieve in many classrooms.

UMC on the other hand while being less described and open to interpretation seems to match the more informal, iterative game making of many participants.

### Different strokes

A different strokes commentary. Depending on aims of the practitioner and context of the game making different tactics may be applicable.


## Representing Coded the Patterns of Activity via coded data

NOTE - NOT SURE WHERE TO PUT THIS PART OR IF THE CHART ELEMENT IS REALLY VALUABLE -
IT COULD BE A DISTRACTION
SO HERE AS A POSSIBILITY IN CONCLUSION - could be moved?

ANOTHER NOTE - I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO DO THE ACTUAL CHARTS OR WORK WITH THE 5 FULLY CODED VIDEOS YET.

We can to examine patterns of activity is through an analysis of the coded video interactions. The coding structure decided upon and the process of coding in five minutes sections.

<!-- NOTE - there may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granuar detail if this process is useful.  -->

Note The full coding scheme will be included here.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit?usp=sharing

The main schemes as below.

- Design Stages -
- Interaction Description -
- Game Elements Addressed (Game Polish, Game Space, Game Mechanics, Game Challenge(remove?))

The process of coding data shed light onto patterns of activity in creating a list of general behaviours shared by participants and thus also identifying outlying behaviours that did not meet the emerging coding scheme. (NOTE FOR HERE OR PREVIOUS?)

Later in the chapter the limits of the chosen design stage schema are explored as a way of illuminating interesting game making behaviour of participants.

<!-- See current table here.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PafC_w_7uObYL4v86IGeeFZTw2yKxjHfP_k85rHk_s/edit?usp=sharing -->

In the following section I use key tools provided by the research software Nvivo to give insight about the engagement of participants by compare time on different tasks.

<!-- For example for the session that the vignette was taken from the below is chart of the time on each of the codes. -->

The coding structure (may) also allows to show the overlap between different code areas. This is useful to explore a question like the following:

- Question One: During which design phase does parent-child pair interaction happen most frequently?
- Question Two: What are the different patterns for participant interaction that happen when working on different game elements?

TO COME.

The first scenario represented in a chart which compares activity grouping with design stages and activity description.

Pair work -> TEST, CREATE, IMPROVE, etc
Peer work -> TEST, CREATE, IMPROVE, etc
Solo work -> perhaps dont an

CHART

The second scenario is represented by pie charts for each game element showing the duration spent on each by a diversity of participants.  

CHART

#### Discussion on data
<!-- NOTE - MOVE THIS? DOESN'T SEEM TO FLOW IN THIS SECTION -->

For the first question only suitable pairs were chosen. This removes a lot of validity from any generalisation of claims that could be made.
This approach has some clear limits. Firstly the breaking of data into 5 min sections is practical but does not allow for some of the finer interactions and changes of behaviour to be accurately coded.  There may be some value is coding some key interactions more carefully in more granular detail.

The game elements / design patterns categories which are presented are created as a design guide rather than on exact principles.
It is possible to code drilling down into another level. This might yield more results.

In summary, the coding process is more valuable as a tool to allow more qualitative reflection and analysis rather than a quantitative process as attempted above.

To make a quantitative approach work better X,Y and Z would need to be in place which was not suitable for this study because of A and B.

<!-- By coding the activity of the child and the adult for this session in depth the following representation of how the child spent their time is available.

- time under table
- time in control of Keyboard
- time actively directing parent's activity
- time actively observing parent's activity
- time discussing game features with parent -->


## Further Areas of Research


### Physical Computing and Game Making:

- There is scant evidence for this in the video data.
- I can make observations from journal notes and try to find mention of it in interviews.

(Imported Writing)
**Physical Computing and Game Making:** The use of physical computing to create concrete and tangible activities can increase the engagement and motivation of learners [@kaloti-hallak_students_2015]. Making the digital concepts physical, and thus allowing exploration via diverse means, also aligns with inclusive learning principles. To support my game making projects, I created simple arcade cabinets out of wood with retro arcade buttons. Connecting arcade buttons to the computer via simple electronics is a project which can be completed quickly. The process of students building their own arcade cabinets for a games showcase increased their perception of the authenticity of their end goal. Some families created low-tech, customised arcade cabinets using cardboard. Although my studies have been small-scale the self-reported effects on learner engagement and motivation of this part of the program were significant.


<!-- For more information on the value of physical computing to increase inclusion you can read this article (RUSK?) -->


## Thoughts Log - things that may end up here.

### GDPs that are already in the template

Some GDPs were not made a part of the menu of options as they were already in the template.
For example Reward.

Is this a missed opportunity to surface and discuss those patterns? cf [@eriksson_using_2019]

### Breaking out of the walled garden:

Te and Da's decision to explore a different starting point and add uncharted GDPs like following enemies.
A potential tension which was resolved quickly in some ways.
But at the cost of maintaining a working game.


### Synergies of use of GDP by practioners and learners in research designs

The use of GDP by practitioners are compared to those of participants and synergies are explored.


### On transfer of gdps - debates
In this context of novice coders in an informal environment it seems appropriate to introduce some levels of reusable practice whilst initially prioritising individual learner engagement and community participation.
Game design patterns contain elements of more abstract and thus repeatable structures thus fulfilling some of the promise transfer offered by advocates of Computational Thinking. This is explored in more depth in the next chapter.

## Overview of 3M pedagogical model

NOTE - INTRODUCE WITH MOTIVE TO ADAPT FOR


The process of developing the learning design happened in tandem with the data gathering. The model was guided by reflection and feedback from ongoing game making sessions. In summer 2020 I began early dissemination of results and wanted to be able to present the essence of the learning resources and design to fellow practitioners and participants as well as researchers.

To do this I created the frame of a 3M model, the aim being to simplify a complex set of resources and teaching processes. The resources have been created under an open licence (CC-BY-SA) which allows them to be freely used and adapted.

### Methods (Inclusive)

NOTE - CHECK NEXT CHAPTER - Revise this to prep for next chapter

Explore other research that builds on lit review concepts and has a game making context.
<!-- Keep in mind DBR, AT concepts, resolving tensions & agency -->

### Missions

<!-- Many commercial open world games offer a central challenge consisting of small incremental missions and then optional side missions. Open world games increase user choice and thus give players a greater feeling of agency. -->

The main challenge of the 3M model is to create a playable game around a theme for a real or imagined audience with learners given the choice to add many optional features to the game.

In addition, side missions encourage social and playful coding approaches which help develop a community of coders. The purpose of mirroring the language of adventure game experience is to create a playful environment, a theme explored in the following chapter.

<!-- This approach steers students towards developing their use and understanding of coding structures, debugging practices and systems concepts.  -->

<!-- In addition, side missions encourage social and playful coding approaches which help develop a community of coders. -->

<!-- Note: TO ADD -  The purpose of mirroring a game experience is to create a playful environment - perhaps to covered in previous chapter -->

<!-- **Side Missions:** Bartle proposed that online gamers play games for different reasons and proposed a initial typology of gamers as socialiser, griefers, achievers and explorers [@hamari_player_2014]. You can find out what kind of game player you are with an online test.[^6] I propose there are also different styles of game makers. Some like to develop a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step. Some are happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results. More social makers like to find out about the games of others or tell stories within games while others mess around with the code to break it interesting ways. To encourage these valuable social coding practices I created extra missions which are available online.[^7] I avoid any claims of fixed learner types here and offer these interpretations primarily as a way to encourage meta-cognitive reflections and choice of activity in line with UDL principles. -->

In the 3M model rather than following a step-by-step tutorial learners start with an incomplete game template and add new features as they choose. Each feature or pattern is described as a mission.


<!-- You may be able to create a menu of printed or online patterns or examples that students can draw on as needed. Perhaps particularly common examples can be modelled to the whole class when it is clear that many students will benefit from that approach. -->

In my final implementation of the 3M model students picked missions from a choice of printed cards or online resources. There were colour themed categories of missions. _Game mechanics_ are features to do with the actions of the game. _Game space_ patterns address the layout of the game. _Game polish_ patterns involve adding music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements. Finally _System and Challenge_ patterns look at how different elements interact to create challenge in the game. An example of a game mechanic design pattern follows.

START TEXT BOX
Your mission is to apply the following pattern to your game. There are supporting step-by-step resources available if you need them. When you finish be sure to reflect on how adding this pattern helps your understanding of the computing concepts and similar patterns listed. This concludes your mission.  

* **Name of Game Design Pattern:** Jumping on Enemies to Zap them
* **Type Pattern:** Game Mechanic
* **Description:** If the player is descending from a jump when they touch the enemy the player is zapped and in this case disappears.
* **Need for Pattern:** Enemies create challenge and being able to jump on an enemy is a good way of clearing the area you want to explore.
* **Coding Concepts involved:** Arrays[^1], Change Listener[^2]
* **Links to other Computing Patterns:** Systems Dynamics[^3]
* **Related Game Patterns:** You'll need to have added the **Add Enemies** pattern to your game before you can add this one.
END TEXT BOX

<!--

NOTE - On supportAing resources - move to relevant section.

In addition to outlines of game patterns, print-outs or on-line documents to support learners to implement the code needed are provided. While on-line documents allow learners to copy and paste code thus avoid many syntax errors, printed or incomplete code examples provide a greater level of challenge.

Supporting resources help resolve tensions around learners getting stuck and needing a lot of facilitator help. These resources can help teachers deliver game making in a classroom context. Educators can alter resources to vary how much detail is provided in supporting documents to suit the challenge level for students. I work with young coders, thus I normally provide significant coding scaffolding. Once learners have built familiarity with code structures, processes and the coding environment, I provide less complete code examples and thus reduce the scaffolding. -->

## Follow up work / limitations



### Next work addressing racial and gender based issues of inclusion

The possibilities align with similar research, home interests etc.
How will this pedagogies impact?

### Missing data on starting game / quick start cards

Study on the use of templated starting cards was unfortunately hindered by the logistics of the recording process which began only after this process had happened and may participants had already undertaken one phase.

A separate study of a stand-alone group engaging with this starting template and cards would be welcome, and may be a legitimate follow up to this study.

### Advantages and limitations of Home Education context

Comments include:

- Reflecting back on interview there were very highly insightful comments from home educators that did influence the design.
- Thus a very fruitful area for jointly created design research
- However it is important then to not extend all conclusions beyond this setting but to extract the essense and try to seed in other settings using accelerated ways to construct and scaffold the kinds of support that home ed parents can offer.

# From Conclusion - integrate here.

### How can this map to other computing environments?
