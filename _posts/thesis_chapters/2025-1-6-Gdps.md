# The Use of Gameplay Design Patterns "It’s like a project in itself, really"

## Research Questions - March 2024

1. What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to participation in game coding processes?
2. How does CHAT theory help us understand how game design patterns x  can be used in an evolving community of novice game makers?
3. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?



## Notes to restructure

Integrate the section on flexible design patterns into a discussion that also addresses aspects of the process of constructing repertoires using designed affordances facilitating "cultural mediation" [Moll]

Thus Discussion points include

* Explain findings using CHAT concepts, Actions to Operations. GDPs used in varied forms of mediation
* Beyond mediation, it can be seen as a lens of TA transformative agency - how is this different? But this seems a high bar - examples unclear - and potentially lack a clear focus on cultural aspects?  
* The concept of repertoires, seems appropriate to some mid uses, not simple mediation, but not HIGH transformative  - similar to assemblages or a rhizomatic perception.  
* This flexibility is observable in data - flexible design practices

NOTE - perhaps flip the order again to end with cultural aspects, and include the drama process, and maker types / missions within the data presented. As an additional section or incorporate into the table - like within Funds of Identity.

**Older notes**
Really address  the community aspect of the RQ - and highlight that this is why personal elements are not explored in more detail

In each section if there are multiple aspects of that then put into headings  - and put this into the coding structure for data review

Examine overlap of the cultural uses of GDP, and the next chapter - hand in hand here get an overview of what needs to extracted from the data and where it sits

Also work out what to move to Lit Review - and restructure LT and Methodology based on two chapters near completion.

<!-- **On GDP as a germ-cell and unit of analysis recap of design patterns** -->
<!-- In the introduction of this thesis, I outlined some of the broader challenges of sharing practice and research to practically support the learning of coding practices beyond the immediate context of the research in question. The choice of what scope of activity to examine in detail is relevant to this challenge.  -->

In the previous chapter, I outlined the evolution of tool use, emphasising emerging tensions in activity. This chapter shifts focus to the perspectives of participants, using recorded data to interpret the varied applications of gameplay design patterns (GDPs). In doing so, it addresses the research question: How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices by novices? Chapter 2 summarised software  design patterns as a grouping of a description of target project behaviour, with a suggested community solution of code structure often accompanied with worked examples. While existing research explores the use of game design patterns in educational settings, for instance to aid the transfer of science simulation concepts to other contexts [@repenning_scalable_2015; @basawapatna_using_2010] or as a foundation for co-design work [@eriksson_using_2019], there is limited work addressing their role in overcoming challenges faced by emerging communities of game creators using text coding. The last chapter investigated iterative activity involving alterations to games at the level of gameplay design patterns as part of the mutual evolution of learning design. This evolution encompassed various forms, including supporting resources such as code examples, instructional tutorials and quick-start activities proposing micro-level code modifications. This chapter builds on that analysis, focusing on the use of GDPs in diverse mediational strategies, not only within facilitator-provided resources and scaffolds but also as part of emerging community practices and interpersonal repertoires. During data analysis, GDPs appeared in such diverse and significant forms that they became candidates for a germ cell concept.

Regarding the structure of this chapter, it begins with a vignette of parent-child interaction during the game-making process to contextualise the findings that follow. The chapter then presents a systematic analysis of participants’ varied uses of game design patterns, drawing on detailed observations of recorded video data. For this analysis, I employ Rogoff's three planes of analysis [@rogoff_observing_1995], as introduced in Chapter four. Recognising that these observations do not neatly align with the three planes, I discuss the use of GDPs across cultural activities, interpersonal activity and personal knowledge in three distinct sections. These sections focus on how gameplay design patterns are utilised by parents, children and facilitators, each through the lens of the respective analytical plane. An analogy can be drawn between these three planes of analysis and the examination of activity systems at varying scopes. Specifically, the cultural plane aligns with the community scope of activity described in Figure 5.x in the previous chapter, while the interpersonal and personal planes correspond to smaller scopes depicted in Figure 5.x. A discussion section explores the implications of these findings in relation to existing research and theoretical concepts. This discussion considers the examples of GDP use in practice to analyse GDPs as a mid-level construct, demonstrating their utility for both educational designers and researchers.

<!-- SIGNPOSTING TO DOL & OTHER ASPECTS OF GDP Use -->
<!-- **Skilful parental work to sustain engagement** -->
<!-- **Challenge and initiative** -->
<!-- **Lingua franca** -->

<!-- For the preceding ten minutes, the parent and child dyad had been struggling with a tutorial chapter in the online course manual textbook, included as Appendix.tech.samplechapter, which explains how to add the pattern of keys and doors. In this pattern, players must collect a key and then navigate to a door to progress to the next level. The parent, Susanna, had been making multiple changes to the code while the child, Tehillah, expressed boredom. Susanna then suggested that Tehillah ask the facilitator, Mick, for help in resolving the coding issue. Once the bug was resolved, Susanna handed the keyboard to Tehillah to test the now working game. The implementation of a new game design pattern (GDP) involves adding new code to the game. The amount of code and changes required varies depending on its complexity. Larger changes typically require more careful manipulation of code and subsequent debugging. The key and door pattern is relatively technically challenging to implement. Tehillah is one of the younger participants, and the parent, Susanna, has taken on the role of solving harder coding problems and, in doing so, has built important proficiency in coding practice.

The parent takes action to involve her child in the design process when technically possible and to incorporate her child's interests. Susanna overcomes her own hesitancy about asking for facilitator help by encouraging her child to seek assistancehttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ce2cYIYnFCd9GM8zRntBd7lrud-dMbbrtgEQMoGNRmE/edit?tab=t.0. When the coding problem is resolved, Susanna signals to Tehillah that it is her turn to return to the design process. This indicates that Susanna recognises the greater potential for effective input from her child at these moments. After the blockage caused by debugging is removed, Susanna immediately re-engages Tehillah, prompting her to play-test the game. Susanna skilfully navigates the process, eliciting and incorporating her child's interests in a variety of ways.

The child also shows initiative, particularly in relation to level design. There is an awareness of and playfulness surrounding the conventions of a platformer game as a dynamic system, which drives their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game. An understanding of the game as a dynamic system becomes especially evident in the parent’s alarm when, shortly after this interaction, the child deletes all elements of hazard in one level. The pair use the names of the game design patterns they are working on (Adding Levels and Keys and Doors) (Key 44 in Vignette 2). Evidence suggests that Tehillah (child) is building a connection to the game-making pattern. In Key 12 in Vignette 2, abbreviations of the GDP names, Key and Door and Levels, are repeated in a sing-song voice. Additionally, my https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ce2cYIYnFCd9GM8zRntBd7lrud-dMbbrtgEQMoGNRmE/edit?tab=t.0description of the Key and Door pattern as a challenging pattern during the session's starting orientation, outlined in Vignette 11, provokes a strong reaction. The use of GDP terms as a lingua franca, a concept that underpins the broader utility of design patterns [@erickson_lingua_2000], to facilitate designing for others is explored in the next section. More broadly, the use of GDP concepts as an evolving design language for providing feedback, sharing knowledge, making requests and other purposes during community activities, pair interactions and individual work is explored in the following sections. -->

## The role of GDPs in the personal appropriation of concepts and processes  - ( Target 1000)

<!--
KEEP LINK BUT MOVE LATER
The previous section began to touch on the personal appropriation of coding skill via the debugging process. -->


As outlined in Chapter 2, the focus on skills and knowledge developed by participants is the dominant thread in research on digital coding and game making [@kafai_constructionist_2015-1; @papert_mindstorms:_1980]. The research aims of this study focus on the under explored areas of social and cultural aspects of the coding process of novices and as such the design of this study does not suit full exploration of the personal plane of activity. In this informal learning context, participants did not request exploration of concepts aligned with computing curriculum, instead driven more by practical desire to make a game using the tools provided. Despite this, the evolving design process surfaced activities which and allow the exploration of surfacing of computational thinking and other curricular concepts. Given the potential to adapt this learning design to a more formal environment to address needs outlined in the introductory chapter, from P2 onwards I began to augment the learning design to suit curriculum oriented teaching and assessment of computational thinking concepts and skills, a process which resulted in a learning map of curricular concepts included here as Table 6.x .

<!-- NOTE - this map focuses on more concrete concepts,  -->

Appendix.learningmap explores in more detail the evolution of this map, which acknowledges significant tensions in integration of concepts into a informal context, and draws on the process and rationale of Bevan and Petrich's  [-@bevan_learning_2015; -@petrich_it_2013] work to bring a similar learning map to a seemingly chaotic tinkering and making process in museum contexts. Papert's research on Microworlds saw one of the roles learning designers to shape the affordances of playful learning environments to steer learners to explore scientific concepts, mathematical concepts, for example geometry in Turtle computing. Similarly, the design of this research's template can be seen as a half-baked Microworld, with key conceptual affordances represented in the learning map above.

<!-- One area in particular stand out: code patching technique and debugging types of coding errors. This is chosen as an under-researched inclusive practice which merits further investigation (include in Chapter 2). -->

<!-- Evidence of personal appropriation in video data was not be limited  to those suited to a curricular purpose outline in the table,  many of the behaviours explored in this chapter show both the appropriation and feeding back of varied understandings of game design patterns and design practices and skills.  -->

Given that this thesis has a focus on community and social aspects of use of GDPs, evidence of only one dimension of personal appropriation is included here in this section, that of technical implementation of coding structures. The implementation of GDPs can stimulate participants to adopt or to share technical processes in a variety of ways. Technical processes were sometimes introduced in a basic form through scaffolded activities, supporting documentation or evolved from informal interaction between peers. The following observations show the adaptation of introduced processes being modified by the community.


<!-- NOTE - (Additional examples may be included in Appendix.learning) -->


### The interrelationship of GDPs and the development of technical processes

In order to achieve the goals of integrating new or adapting existing game design patterns in their games, participants needed to develop unfamiliar technical process associated with computer coding and including foundational digital skills associated with using a desktop personal computer (see Appendix.digitalliteracy). An example of skills which many participant developed is that of keyboard and mouse use which together with use of internet browser tabs facilitate navigation between computer code, game prototype and supporting web-based documentation.  Such personal appropriation and fluidity are well illustrated in the repeated, solo, incremental changes in level design by Toby (see V1.a). Increased fluidity were shown in by most participants, in particular in the areas of creating and uploading, and integrating graphical assets, adjusting game challenge via altering GDPs elements, and coding processes of debugging and code patching (explored later). In line with CHAT theory, this can be interpreted as an operationalisation of previous actions which were previously explicitly taught or learnt [@leontiev_activity_2009].

While the use of new techniques were driven by the implementation of GDPs, the following observations expose a complex, interdependent relationship between concepts of GDPs and emergent technical processes. In line with Rogoff's understanding of personal appropriation as bi-directional in nature of the appropriation of personal knowledge, emphasising foundational sociocultural view of knowledge as being mutually constituted, participants feed their interpretation of knowledge back into the communities of which they are a part, in this case the game making community. In this process the GDPs act as concepts and project stages to facilitate this interpersonal process, as explored in the following example.

In Vignette 5 (V5.a & V5c), Madiha(p) accesses help from her daughter Nasrin(c) to first format and then exporting graphical files to be imported into the game code project. The implementation of her chosen GDPs drives the development of these technical processes as she must learn or at least to draw on peer knowledge to complete it. The process of changing pen colours on the graphical tool is one which the child has been able to translate into a effortless process whereas the parent is still consciously building her competency. Nasrin has operationalised the process and it becomes part of the toolset of practices that she can draw on. Similarly, in V5.d Madiha is helped in the use of the cropping tool, a process to redundant space at the edges of design sprite characters, by a peer child Ed(c) after he had playtesting Madiha's game.


  <!-- Madiha also benefits, the expertise of her child to undertake that process is added to her distributed toolset. However, she is also keen to develop her own competency as indicated by her asking child to explain the process. -->

  <!--
  NOTE - IS THERE ARE GOOD PLACE FOR THIS IN APPENDIX?
  Some examples contain processes that are linked to the language and the concepts and player experience of GDPs, for example the use of GDP language of hazards and rewards (see extract).

  Other examples are more secondary where the emerging processes and adoption of language concern more to do with more general digital design,  which are needed due to the process of implementing game features - which are in this case structured via GDPs. -->
  <!-- by making a distinction between primary and secondary involvement of GDPS in technical processes. -->
  <!-- Thus while the concepts of GDPs are some times useful to explain a technical concepts directly, especially where direct / immediate feedback involving concrete example of experience are relevant, at times the process in more indirect. -->


  <!--
  MOVE TO TECHNICAL IF NOT ALREADY HTERE
  Playtesting also helped propogate emerging practices. For example, after testing Mi's game In the example above after comments on the jump speed Ed continues.

     Ed: How much jump speed to you have?
     Ed: Your jump speed is massive.
     Ed gives advice about tidying up the sprite outlines.
     Ed: for people with background like yours You can use the “cramping tool””
     Mark  and Ed then explain – SEE THEIR RECORDING
     So that the background is clearer.

  While Ed has only just been introduced to the ability to "cramp". He is happy and able to share this useful tool with Mi. Theme -->

<!-- **Code Patching as a guided technical process and the use of GDPs to nurture tactical responses to coding errors** -->

Turning to the practice of code patching, a guided technical process to scaffold the coding process (see glossary & Chapter 2), video evidence and observational journal notes show the potential of a coupling of code implementation and target behaviour, structured using a framework of GDPs. This patching process became an important process in documentation. While code was provided, in practice mistakes were still made and additional customisations were made. An example of code patching in practice is show in Toby's careful copying and pasting of different lines of code from supporting materials into his game project (see V1.a).

Toby's success in using the code patching technique is supported by the UMC structure of the game template in line with UMC principles explored in the previous chapter and the high level of context present in the use of GDP as a guiding framework of the learning design. This is illustrated in V1 when Toby alters the imported code to produce a kind of programming error I refer to as a glitch: specifically an error where the game keeps working but produces an unintended effect (see V1.a). This glitch bug provoked initial investigation, prompted Toby to ask for my help, and then required a period of iterative revision and cross referencing with the original code snippet. From this and similar observations I propose that the close coupling of code implementation and target behaviour (in this case structured around GDPs) aids scaffolds the debugging process and can be profitably can be drawn on by facilitators. In addition, the key affordances of the learning design, the starting template, code snippets and resulting code patching process increased appear to encourage the creation of glitch errors. The data in in this section is supported by further observations on an emerging diversity of helping strategies in response to different forms of errors in Appendix.debugging. I also explain the patching process in more detail to participants in an extract in V9.

To sum up, I suggest that noticing, celebrating and exploring the code sources which cause the unintended behaviours may be an inclusive strategy to mitigate the potentially frustrating process of debugging. To support this in

## GDPs used in the process of guided participation (Target 2500)

This section explores data on the use of GDPs from the perspective of interpersonal interaction. Here, the process of being guided into planned activity or peer work is exploratory, contributing to interpersonal processes that serve the completion of the activity. As outlined in the previous section, personal understandings of knowledge can be observed in this interpersonal activity, in particular in the interactions between parents and children. Based on observations of video data, I describe how GDPs are used in diverse meditational strategies. I prioritise three categories of interactions which draw on GDPs, specifically use of a provided menu GDPs and supporting documentation, use of GDPs in project ideation and prioritisation, and within division of labour.

<!-- In particular how , ideation, division of labour and prioritisation, and the adoption of technical processes intersect with the use of GDPs. -->

## The use of GDPs examined from an interpersonal focus
This section examines the use of GDPs to facilitate guided participation via interpersonal interactions in game making. Guided participation in this context involved, guidance on organising design activities, various forms of problem solving and help to shift design perspectives. While the primary source of material is from pair interactions between children and parents, at times peer interaction between non-pairs developed into guidance. For example, in the in the example above where Toby provides assistance for Bertie  in adding levels to his game

<!-- However, not all participants used the provided instructions and developed diverse methods to access support for implementing patterns (IS THIS PART NEEDED?). -->

Chapter 5 introduced my provision of a curated catalogue (menu) of gameplay design patterns to addresses the tension between participants' choice and the need for documentation to support the technical implementation of code structures. Appendix.themeing outlines the evolution of how the sub-categories of patterns evolved and my rationale guiding them. In V9, I address the whole group, I describing the webpage presenting the menu GDPs as a hub to help choose project goals and to then find tutorials and code examples. _"It’s almost like this is our control panel. You decide what do you want to do next and we jump off from there."_. In this section I summarise data on the use of menu of GDPs focusing on interpersonal interactions. SUMMARY?


<!-- **tautology** Given the integration of these elements into the learning design from P2 onwards, it would seem natural that participants would use the provided framework, at least in some capacity. Despite this, the evolving use of this documentation, the variations in its use, and the interpersonal interactions surrounding it merit further attention due to the diversity, evolution, and fundamental importance of GDP use at this interpersonal scope. -->


Toby in Vignette 1 (see V1.8 - V1.17) engages in lone working, copying a code from code snippet example of the game design pattern which he chose from a graphical menu of patterns. His independence in selecting and adding new features using supporting documentation helps him take on a mantle of a mentor inspiring and helping others add the same GDPs to their games (see V1.b). Toby's independence and efficacy in this process aligns with existing concepts including: providing shorter, just-in-time tutorials to reduce barriers associated with more extensive instruction-based approaches including barriers of literacy [@dietz_design_2021; @resnick_coding_2020].

Vignette 2 (V2.a) observes parent Susanna(p)'s use of a tutorial to address the goal of implementing her child's chosen GDPs. Susanna is limited in her programming skills and leverages the concept GDPs in particular to access written step-by-step instructions to make progress. Susanna prefers to avoid asking using facilitator help (See V2.b). Participant's choice over which GDPs they tackled can create a personal connection to these goals, a process potentially reducing feelings of alienation from coding or game-making culture (see Tehillah's positive reaction in V2.a and V11).

MOVE? INCLUSIVE DESIGN SUMMARY AT END.

These varied forms of documentation, and their varied adoption and propagation represent different approaches to  scaffolding the process of becoming familiar with and then modifying to the code in often increasingly ambitious ways inline with the stages and ethos of a use-modify-create (UMC) approach. [source]

Key characteristics of structuring support around quick start activities and a subsequent menu of GDPs which align with existing research include:

The use of a menu / collection of resources can be considered an inclusive educational practice and offer a rich description of a concrete example which aims to align to inclusive, practice-based frameworks like UDL and PBL. While this may involve more work in advance, the benefits to inclusive practice merit it.

----

Addressing a separate aspect of reflection, in P2, I guided supporting student facilitators to ask what patterns participants were currently working on or had recently completed as a way of provoking informal reflection on project progress. Additionally in P3, GDPs were prominent in end of session reflections (see Vignette 10). SHOULD THIS BE A SEPARATE SECTION?

Not all participants engage with this menu: a later section shows how GDPs picked up by one learner, via provided documentation e.g Toby are propagate in other ways. For example, in Vignette 3 (V3.a) Ed cedes this aspect to his father in a way explored in the section below on division of labour.

It is also important to note that there are potential issues concerning validity of observations on the use of the GDP menu and related concepts as a navigational tool by participants and to leverage access to relevant help, due to their nature as being introduced for that purpose. The danger here is of circular reasoning in methodology. At this early stage, this study acknowledges the potential of circular reasoning, but observes the potential of GDP adoption and in particular to note evolution of practices by participants. In addition, this process of using GDPs in this way was also _discovered_ by myself via an exploratory DBR approach, and thus its introduction is also significant and cannot be divorced from the aspect of participant reaction.

Thus in summary, the evidence supports the potential of a menu of GDPs to address the tensions between choice based approaches and the danger of lack of of support in P1 with technical and organisational processes. AND..

<!-- NOTE - PERHAPS INTEGRATE PART OF THE CODE PATCHING PROCESS FOR THIS SECTION -->

These barebone game projects were hosted on a code playground. An online document in our shared google drive working space linked to these examples. I would help participants access this when they requested a certain feature. This list of game features began to grow. For phase one these code example were not particularly successful at increasing learner independence. There were differences in the code structure of their games and the examples and translation was not intuitive. -->

### GDPs used to scaffold ideation and prioritisation processes (800)

(AND REFLECTION?)
<!-- Other techniques that leveraged the characteristics of game design patterns to support the ideation process emerged in community design activities. -->
<!-- NOTE - ADD MORE ON GESTURING  -->

The previous chapter explored the tension between participant choice and scaffolding via menu of GDPs. In my journal notes on the shift from P1 to P2, I noted that the provision of this menu of GDPs significantly decreased in time spend in ideation phase by providing scaffolding a restricted of choice. Beyond this immediate impact, this section outlines how the use GDP concepts and supporting tools were used in ideation and project organisation, specifically: as a lingua franca, as a visual prototyping tool, and within participant gestural interaction.

Video data surfaced frequently use of GDPs terms as a lingua franca to organise and prioritise game making activity. An exchange from Vignette 3 between participants Ed and Mark shows the use of GDP concepts to help resolve a tension between a more chaotic style of working jumping from one goal to another and a parental motivation to prioritise work. The pair's initial listing of features is a brainstorming technique uses of the approximate names of of game design patterns (_get the person animated_, _get an enemy in_, _changing the platforms_, _make a theme tune_). The vignette analysis sees the parent _overwhelmed_ with the child's lack of focus on one pattern "that’s what I mean, you can’t just skip around like that".

<!-- THIS IS MORE ON A COMMUNITY LEVEL - AND TECHNICAL PERHAPS MOVE
In Vignette 5.d, where the parent Madiha wants to export an image from the graphical editing tool and to import this into the game, shows an evolving use of some of the terminology that has been introduced partly by facilitator interventions and partly emerging organically through community interaction. the terms here are used first to request help, and then to discuss emerging community norms. -->

<!-- OTHER DATA ON GDP AS LINGUA FRANCA AT VARIOUS STAGES. -->
<!-- In this interaction above which was used to illustrate Madiha and Nasrin's division of labour, the parent is focused on completing the action of creating a graphical asset of a hazard as part of the activity of adding the GDP of including a hazard into the game. -->

<!-- Mark: I’ve brought the music, and also we could just concentrate on one thing and just change that. You know, keep working through.
Ed: Yeah. I think I want to get an enemy in - oh no - my person animated.
Mark: So you want to get your person animated that’s the main thing.
Mark: Shall we concentrate on that and changing the platforms into something different? -->

In Vignette 7 (see V7.a), home-based knowledge of GDP mechanics is utilised on an interpersonal plane, with Dan(p) helping Toby(c) via guided facilitation to provoke and shape new design ideas. Dan(p) draw on the game playing experiences to promote innovation in the design of the existing template: _"the previous style of game was a platform (makes shape with hands) game wasn't it? You went along and there was gravity pushing down. There are other types of games aren't there?"_ The pair use their knowledge of game play patterns and genre conventions to break out of the genre constraints of starting template.  Here they are charting new territory beyond the curated choices of GDPs and as such may not have vocabulary to express concepts. Both Dan and Toby make extensive use of gestures in their interaction reinforces their spoken references to GDP concepts.

In the same vignette (see V7.12-16), Toby uses the code based tilemap tool to design a maze game instead of a platformer game drawing on existing knowledge of tools and home knowledge of the target game genre to rapidly make revisions without extensive planning. This use of GDPs to allow the spacial exploration of design in a visual and intuitive way suits being mapped onto paper, or onto graphical software which allows for a similarly rapid prototyping.

By way of contrast, other pairs take advantage of paper prototyping (see Appendix.prototyping) . Susanna(p) notices the child's difficulty in using cursor and delete/backspace keys to edit a matrix allowing level design. The parent provides a book with grid paper to allow the child to replicate the matrix. The parent is then able to transcribe the design to the code example while engaging the child by checking she has interpreted the design correctly. The use of GDPs to support visual prototyping is also undertaken by Mark and Ed explored in more detail in Appendix.tech.prototyping

<!-- NOTE  dol and identities.
Skills to perform these activities were at often distributed between different family members. For some adult re-enforcing their identities as project managers, and for young participants forming identities as digital specialists.  -->


Addressing division of labour on an interpersonal plane, participants worked mostly as pairs or individuals, alternating between community playtesting and pair/individual design work. Turning to the use of GDPs specifically in DoL as an organisational strategy, structuring work processes through implementing modular sub-projects in the form of GDPs can aid division of labour. GDPs feature in processes division of labour in a variety of ways: working knowledge of different types of GDPs can help participants to divide work by working on different patterns or taking on project elements within patterns.

In Vignette 3 (V3.a), Mark(p) repeatedly steers his son Ed to pick one GDP for them to carefully work through the associated documentation together, a process he later refers to in interview data as _plodding_ . Early in that session Mark takes a significant amount of time puzzling over documentation on how to add animation to a character. This results in Ed being blocked from progressing and to address this tension child proposes dividing their labour and workig on two separate computer (see V3.9 _"Why don’t you go there for a computer and you can do that?"_). Ed appears to make a tactical decision allowing the father to specialise in GDPs that involve deciphering technical instructions, whilst he engages with a pattern that involves creating audio and graphical assets in a less technical, more exploratory process.

While in this case, a decision was made to work side-by-side on the same game using different computers, data uncovered other ways in which the participant divided the process of game making, in ways which uncovered traces of home collaboration practices. For example, In Vignette 2, Susanna(p) and Tehillah(c) relied on the parent to do the majority of code implementation but shared one computer. The parent took a lead on many activities but took care that they alternated between use of keyboard and mouse to give the child hands on experience when possible, particularly in level design activities and playtesting (see V2.7). In interview data (see V2.b), the parent notes _"I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles."_  In another exchange (see), Tehillah (c) uses the name of a GDP within a request for her parent to take on a specific task within their making process, "Go on then. Key-Door person." When the parent expresses confusion Tehillah gestures with her hands to indicate that her mother is the person she is referring to. The child appears to consider the level of complexity needed to add a new pattern into the code to be beyond her ability and thus directly delegate the task to her mother. At times Susanna(p) asked Tehillah(c) to seek help from facilitator (V2.1). On another occasion when the child appeared bored of waiting for parent to solve a code problem, she approached the facilitator to ask for help on behalf of the adult without prompting. At other times Tehillah(c) engages more peripheral activities such as watching older children playtest each others games, or observing community activity from under the table.

Madiha's(p) family Nasrin(c) and Zidane(c) are all working on separate games on different computers. While Madiha sits next to Zidane who needs closer support, Nasrin often sits close by but next to a friend. In Vignette 5, as part of her process of building an emerging identity as a graphical asset designer (see V5.b) Madiha call across the room to draws on Nasrin's help to correct a design mistake. Nasrin affects reluctance in her support of her mother (see V5.a), but at other times shows that she enjoys her status of technical supporter (see V5.d). Nasrin appears reluctant to explain the technical processes she uses to help her mother:
_"Madiha (to Nasrin): What are you doing? You have to tell me what you are doing so I can do it myself."_ This may be driven by a desire to preserve this specialist status and utility to her mother. (CHECK INTERVIEW DATA)

<!-- Toby and Dan's pair process of accessing professional documentation also illustrated an aspect of their family learning culture.  -->

Toby adopts different working arrangements dependent on which family members he attends with. While in P2 when supported by grandparents Toby had worked mostly alone (see V1), in P3, he works as a pair with his father (Dan) in closely guided practice (see V7.b). In several interchanges the father starts as a facilitator taking a lead from the direction of the child. As the child reaches the limits of their ability he begins to be more directive, by asking leading questions and testing existing knowledge. Finally, in order to complete the programming or research tasks beyond of the child's knowledge, the father is more direct in instruction, directing the research and proposing a coding solution for their new game design pattern. Dan's experience as a software engineer and volunteer at Coder Dojo (see glossary), is relevant as a fund of knowledge he draws on (see V7.a and later section).

#### Discussion on division of labour in the video data

**Leveraging the possibilities of emerging divisions of labour:**  While the context of the participants as families involved in home education makes any general claims difficult, these observations support  exist in other research in this domain. For example, research shows that children have the potential to help parents as technology brokers [@correa_brokering_2015]. In joint technology work parents can fulfil several,reciprocal roles including, collaborator, resource provider, learner, non-technical consultant and emotional support [@barron_parents_2009].

Thus, in response to the creative support that parents and siblings provide, facilitators should design learning environments to facilitate these possibilities. The work of Roque provides guidance for helpers in the process to support parents to value and feel confident these roles [@roque_im_2016] in a way which mirrors the use of helpers this phase of my study.

While these examples involve GDPs others are explore in relation to development of agency in the following chapter. The examples above illustrate, part some of the varied strategies to  divisions of labour adopted by participants at times involving  complex tensions in activity. For example  Madiha and Nasrin reversed traditional helping relationship, and the child would reluctantly implement the parent's requested technical elements of GDPS but would pointedly not explain the changes made, seemingly taking pride in knowing something that her mother didn't.

Similarly, while Tehillah's activity away from the screen  while non-productive within the scope of technical progress, can be characterised as legitimate peripheral activity of observation of community activity [@lave_situating_1991 ; @rogoff_learning_2014].  Indeed the possibility for children to _not_ engage in community activities is seen by Rogoff [-@rogoff_cultural_2003; -@rogoff_organization_2016] as an important characteristics in participation based models of learning.

The variety of repertoires of helping practice depends in part on the different funds of knowledge the parent has access to. Toby and Dan's pair process is more guided and focused than many other participants and includes accessing professional documentation and exploration of computational thinking concepts.

While the helping pattern of accessing the repetoire of researching and accessing technical documentation is available to all pairs, due to the level of skill and experience involved, other technical processes are developed by most participants and are explored in the next section.

## Use of GDPs in the cultural plane / community level of activity

Following Rogoff's [@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes approach to analysis, the following section explores the use of GDPs at the community plane of activity. While Rogoff's earlier analysis of activity on a cultural plane emphasised the metaphor of apprenticeship, focusing on an already existing community, her later work with Gutiérrez [@gutierrez_cultural_2003] places greater emphasis on cultural activity as dynamic.
ADD TABLE FOR GESTURES?This perspective examines existing and emerging norms and repertoires, adapted from participants’ engagement in other communities and contexts.

### The role of GDPs to facilitate learners to design for others

<!-- NOTE - ALSO LINKED TO IDEATION? - is this guided participation? -->


The use of GDPs, particularly during playtesting, can support the process of imagining end-user experiences. This section examines how the concept of, and experience with, implementing GDPs encouraged participants to envision the experience of end users of their games. Chapter two explored the proposition from professional and participatory design processes that design should be informed by end-user experience [@redstrom_towards_2006], as well as the challenges involved in undertaking such an *"operationalization of empathy"* [@surma-aho_conceptualization_2022, p.1]. From a CHAT interpretation, this process involves shifts in perspective by participants as they engage with objectives across different scopes of activity. For instance, in the vignette above, Tehillah (child) pursues a quirky design goal during her paired design work, which Susanna (parent) resists. Imagining a shift in perspective to the intended audience at a community level of interaction, the parent aims to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player.  


Susanna shares *"Must be quite hard to get through that door."* when Tehillah places the exit door high above a platform. She then continues, *“It’s no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid.”* Tehillah (child) seems determined to remove all hazards. *"It is for me!"* she counters. She may be aware of the implications for game balance but takes pleasure in this destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play.  However, a later interaction with a peer shows that Tehillah (child) is indeed imagining the experience of the immediate audience of fellow game makers and supporting students. *"I like making it frustrating. That other people find it frustrating!"* Tehillah (child) notes the persistence of a student helper who pushes past her frustration to complete the game. Her remark, *"If people tried hard they would get to my level,"* shows her awareness that not all players will persist in the same way to reach her final level, which has only rewards and no hazards. This being a *"secret, special"* experience, which plays against the norms of platform game design, is thus intended to provoke player surprise.

<!-- While Susanna(p) imagine a user experience and make a playable game conforming to her perception of norms, Tehillah's(c) playful imagining of the experience of a more immediate audience of fellow game makers and supporting students appears to provide a tangible motivation with rapid rewards.

NOTE #### GDP concepts and language used in informal feedback for peers to influence modification of games (developing community norms) - -->

There are other examples of how concepts of game challenge and other aspects of gameplay experience evolved through informal feedback during playtesting and served to influence peers to modify their games to increase the enjoyment of peer players. The discussion of game challenge, specifically comments about how 'hard' participant games were, was a particularly common interaction during playtesting. Vignette.challenge outlines a key interaction which demonstrates norming behaviour towards Madiha(p) who has concentrated on the graphics of her game to the detriment of the level of challenges. In particular, the controls of the game are frustrating. The vignette shows varied attempts to influence Madiha to change the game variables to make the gameplay less frustrating. They praise the look of the game but offer feedback on the experience of the game mechanic of jumping. While the players do not tell Madiha directly to change the game, these comments appear to direct the direction of the design to comply with an emerging community norm of how a player jumps should feel, stemming from the participants' feedback on the feeling of lack of control over the player's character in the game. These behaviours are some of the informal norming behaviours that are less directive, seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues, as explored in the literature review [@rogoff_cultural_2003].

E.g. The use of GDPs to facilitate learners to design for others was present in 6 of the 12 video capture sessions analysed.

The two examples explored above serve to highlight two dimensions of the use of GDP concepts to facilitate the process of designing for others. The first is the influence of making in a cultural setting where regular playtesting by peers occurs on the making process. The second is through either direct advice by pair partners and peers in playtesting to imagining others user experience, or indirectly by gameplay feedback or suggesting alterations to GDP implementations.

### GDPs facilitate the use of wider funds of knowledge and interest


<!-- [Be sure to explore context further and put in intro]. -->

GDPs can allow participants to share and explore funds of knowledge and interest in the emerging learning community. One premise driving my exploration of the use of gameplay features in pedagogy is that the tacit knowledge of gaming conventions among most family members is extensive, even if they are not avid gamers, due to the extensive influence of video game culture in mainstream culture, including contexts of family life [@ito_hanging_2010; @livingstone_digital_2018], particularly retro gaming [@heineman2014public]. As such, the process of facilitating ways to surface and work with such tacit knowledge aligns with Moll's concept of funds of knowledge, and, potentially, funds of identity [@fasso_identity_2020; @esteban-guitart_funds_2014]. Within a CHAT framework, these funds of identity and knowledge can be seen as tools that facilitate the transfer of potentially useful concepts and practices across the boundaries between activity systems, in this case, between home activity and that happening in this game-making community. The associated inclusive benefits of working with participants' home interests are explored by Barron [@barron_conceptualizing_2010; @barron_interest_2006-1] and similar work by Gutiérrez on third spaces [@gutierrez_developing_2008]. Existing research outlines the motivations for social making incorporating gaming cultural elements [@ito_hanging_2010; @gee_what_2003] and the ability to make personalised game assets and narratives, which sustain engagement in digital making projects [@sefton-green_mapping_2013].


In the last chapter, I outlined processes facilitating participants in creating and incorporating graphical, audio assets, and narrative elements into their games, and, referencing Appendix.tech.gameframework, briefly outlined how these elements were themed as _Game Polish_ items within a typology of GDPs, which aligned with the MDA (mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics) game element framework explored in Chapter 2. The different types of GDPs available to participants to choose from in the menu of GDP documentation and code snippets allowed for a choice in participant making paths, enabling alignment with home interests. This point is well illustrated via the domain of polish/aesthetics in Vignette 5, where Madiha and Nasrin show identification with the graphical-making process and the process of bringing that aspect of creativity into their games. Beyond their internal family interaction, they share this artistic flair and attention to detail with the emerging learning community. Another pair Clive and Pearl, the grandparents of Toby, included a narrative message at the start of their game surfacing the interest and expertise of the family as beekeepers (see V6). This sparked interesting conversations with other participants.

In addition to issues of aesthetics, home knowledge of game mechanics and dynamics (the M and D of the MDA framework) also contributed to emerging cultural repertoires. As explored in the previous section, Vignette 4 gives several examples of participant feedback on the dynamics of Madiha's game in the level of the challenge experienced by players. Peers shared their experience of what makes a good game to bear in the feedback they shared. Turning to the area game mechanics, In see V1.b Bertie(c) comments on Toby(c)'s game, which has a dominant game experience of timed jumping: *"It’s like parkour in Minecraft but timed. It’s like playing the game Wipeout. Have you ever played Wipeout?"*. Parkour in Minecraft and Wipeout are both game experiences whose main gameplay mechanic is about judging jumps and landing accurately. Bertie makes links to his existing experience of games, making comparisons between Toby's game, commercial games, and his own. In doing so, Bertie is able to show his knowledge and analysis of gameplay patterns. Additionally, the guidance of Dan(p) for Toby(c) explored above in Vignette 7, saw the parent explicitly drawing out the child's home knowledge of games to enable an exploration of a different set of game mechanics. Thus, the tacit knowledge of GDPs of children and adults as game players serves them in knowledge-brokers roles in the process of feeding back and ideation [@wenger_communities_1998].

Thus observations from video data in this study support existing research which highlight the motivating potential of incorporating home interests in games, coding and media projects [@resnick_mothers_2012; @papert_mindstorms:_1980]. They also support findings of other research on the use of funds of knowledge and interest in digital projects as motivating factors and as a way to overcome barriers to alien cultures [@gutierrez_learning_2019-1; @moje2001maestro]. This research also aligns with PBL research that indicates that allowing participants to incorporate home interests can be highly motivating both in initial stages [@swirski_does_2018-1; @penuel_connecting_2022], and to sustain activity and overcome problems in order to share the personalised object created [@barron_interest_2006]. I also propose that this use of the MDA framework as a way of providing varied learning pathways has potential to aid facilitators to align with existing inclusive pedagogy, a point I explore in more detail in the discussion section.

### Evolution and propagation of GDPs concepts during playtesting

<!-- NOTE NOT PLAYTESTING THAT IS IMPORTANT HERE - INSTEAD THE ROLE AND NATURE OF GDPS TO AID PROPAGATION -->
<!-- NOTE THIS includes NON TEMPLATED GDPs? -->

<!-- While GDPs were often demanded by pairs or individuals, and then in P2 a menu of suggested GDPs introduced by had a role, there is a community dimension in the way participants worked with the concepts and the concrete implementation of GDPs.   -->
<!-- In addition to the names of patterns as a lingua franca to comment on games during the process of playtesting, participants also    -->

Within the emerging idioculture of the game-making sessions, and during playtesting in particular, the implementation of popular or novel GDPs by participant pairs or individuals is often spread through peer activity. Both documented (those part of provided resources) and novel GDPs (those introduced by participants) were transmitted between participants, enriching the games of participants. At times, participants were influenced by playing the games of others, and at times, they would request the direct help of peers to implement GDPs in their own games.

As the process of playtesting emerged, community norms began to develop, some of which where influenced by home experience of game playing. Vignette 4 (V4.a) outlines the community norming of Madiha(p)'s game to conform to expected standards of a platform game.

In part two of Vignette 1, Toby's work adding 21 levels to his game is noticed by Bertie who then asks Toby, _"Can you show me how you add more levels on to yours?"_

The full exchange shows an example of the propagation of GDPs emerging from the process of community playtesting through a direct request. It is possible that Bertie's request to Toby is prompted by Bertie noticing Toby helping Nasrin and Harper add levels to their games. Toby's emerging role as a specialist that the community can draw on for practical help, and similar examples (see also that of Nasrin in Vignette 5), were welcomed by me as a way to reduce dependence on myself as a facilitator, or to provide an alternative to the instruction-based support documents.


Other examples of propagating patterns include placing hazards in tricky places like a lava pit, the use of moving enemies and changes to jump dynamics.


<!-- EVIDENCE? PRESENCE / FREQUENCY?   -->
<!-- NOTE ADD MORE EVIDENCE? -->

<!-- ADD IN FREQUENCY IF POSSIBLE - A ROUGH APPROXIMATION OF WORKING PATTERNS IN P2. -->

<!-- A different pattern of propagation was that participants notice and comment on a game element or pattern during during playtesting, and then to use supporting resources or facilitator help to implement it. A less frequent pattern involved participants' diligent and deliberate use of supporting resources to identify and implement features without peer influence. -->

<!-- **New GDPs emerged from existing patterns through peer activity during playtesting** -->
<!-- DEVELOP -->

In addition to the propagation of GDPs offered in the menu of supporting documentation, other gameplay patterns and related design concepts emerged organically from the community. For example, Olive's concept of a level that eschews challenge and offers only rewards, a type of bonus stage pattern, emerged through playful experimentation (see Vignette 2). Similarly, the concept of a safe zone in the game of Pearl and Clive arrived as a direct result of adding a moving enemies GDP. The extensive use of that pattern dominated the game challenge to such an extent that it became essential for players to quickly identify and use 'safe zones'. These novel concepts may have emerged spontaneously or have a source in part from participants' funds of gaming knowledge. In either case, once the concept of safe zone or bonus level enters the linguistic and coding repertoire of this community of game makers, they may spread if other participants pick up on them. Even if other participants only noticed the use of GDPs and used approximate terminology to comment on them during playtesting, this form of activity can be seen as legitimate peripheral participation [@lave_situated_1991; @guzdial_imagineering_2006], and thus a helpful practice contributing to the emerging ecosystems of the learning community.




<!-- **synthesis of this section** -->

This section has explored the use of GDPs within strategies and processes that occur at a community level in a way that demonstrates the transfer between different activity systems, supporting Gutiérrez's perspective [@gutierrez_developing_2008] regarding the importance of transcending borders and linguistic practices between sites of learning. Playtesting served as a medium for a shared idioculture to emerge and, as such, became a significant part of the pedagogy of the learning design. While the design processes directly linked to implementing GDPs were among the most significant in the video data, others were present. The role of playtesting and other community interactions, including warm-up games and session reflections, are explored in relation to the development of agency in the following chapter.



## Reduced discussion section


### Intro in relation to mediation and repertoires

**TADS / sannino vs gutierrez - and the purpose of inclusivity / equity**

This section continues analysis of the diverse roles of GDPs the game making activity using CHAT concepts including: GDP use as mediational tools, as incorporated part of wider repertoires of practice, and the role of GDPs within participant development of transformational agency.

Addressing GDPs as a mediational tool. Chapter 5 outlined design decisions and this chapter explored the impact. For example, the uses of the quick start activities, tutorials and code snippets as supporting tools, if viewed in isolation can been as more straight forward, triangular form of subject, tool, object mediation (see Chapter 4 diagram).

Turning to repertoires, other non-GDP elements of the learning design are mixed together in these emerging repertoires and thus to neglect to explore them would give an incomplete picture. Gutiérrez's focus on repertoires of practice draws on the importance of wider cultural focus of the learning process.

    Such a perspective on the relationship between culture and learning is also about attention to the “cultural mediation of thinking” (Moll, 1998) cited in [@digiacomo_seven_2017] p.44

Of particular relevance here is Gutiérrez's focus on movement of identity between settings and the role of facilitators to facilitate this via learning design.

In this chapter's discussion this wider focus on cultural elements is addressed via an exploration of flexible approaches to the design practice, it is also explored in the following chapter in an exploration of the evolving culture of this communities playtesting practices.

<!-- And following that the link to inclusive linguistic element of the pedagogy which can be aligned with other inclusive practices of UDL. In this study the focus is less on aspects of ethnical cultural elements and more the those related to neurodiversity.

The third aspect is the more experimental, innovative form of mediation within TADS [Sannio].
This aspect is explored to an extent here, SAY HOW, but is also taken up in more detail in the following chapter.

HOW EXACTLY TO DO THIS - AND IS THIS THE RIGHT PLACE?
OR NEXT CHAPTER?
OR DROP?


### Observations on emerging design practices

<!-- NOTE To restructure. -->

I propose that new GDPs elements can be integrated with existing home repertoires of practice to form novel flexible design practices.

Several of the observations in vignettes described above, especially those involving interpersonal guided participation, detail the interweaving of novel concepts and practices with existing repertoires. An example being the use of visual prototyping explored above and in more detail in appendix.prototyping.

In the previous chapter I outlined this learning design as aligned more with a step-based approach than a design-build-test one.  As mentioned in Chapter 3, the process of examining video data also did not align with common design thinking stages as I initially thought might be the case.  The stages were instead fragmented and sometimes happened in parallel. In many interactions I observed improvisational approaches which incorporated ideation, planning, implementation and testing in space of a minute or so. If I had encouraged participants to follow prescribed design stages this may have restrict this flexibility in practice. This concern is echoed in research which critiques a similar, staged approach to creative writing in primary education using a writing cycle approach.  [@kuby_rhizomatic_2016]


This section therefore describes a set of evolving and flexible design practices as a counterpoint to  design thinking stages. These practices includes emerging norms, DoL, and community behaviour.


<!-- MOVE TO CHAP 3?
As explored in the literature review design stages as a conceptual design tool is common in CS education, e.g. Resnick's creative learning spiral [@resnick_all_2007, p. 2]. In data analysis I created a coding theme based on a design cycle framework: Ask / Imagine, Plan, Create, Test, Improve, Share. When coding I observed that naturalistic practice rarely matched the progression of the design cycle.  -->


**Observations and evidence on flexible design practice**

As typified in vignette 1 and 5 , some younger participants in particular developed impressively fluid practice demonstrating extremely rapids shifts between code editing, game testing, authoring assets in online tools and migrating files often while talking with peers. Some older participants also showed rapid, responsive creativity. Grandad Clive quickly incorporated a boost to player health after a level after being given feedback during playtesting [EVIDENCE?].

At other times design processes were experimental with no clear end goal. In exploring sound making software Ed and Mark start a process of tinkering and messing about with the capability of the tools which spurs creativity. The joint improvised process created two different soundtracks. This sparks a new proposal to incorporate different soundtracks for different levels. Pairs often adopted a similar spirit of improvisation. In V7 Dan(p) makes a suggestion - "Use paper to design?" - to which Toby(c) replies "I'm just going with it."

**Lingua Franca return?:**
The examples of this chapter show the importance of GDPS as a lingua franca to facilitate these kinds of flexible responsive collaboration.



These observations of the value of flexible design processes, invite discussion on how best to conceptualise and support these flexible approaches. One potentially fruitful perspective is that ofrhizomatic design approaches [@de_freitas_classroom_2012]. Research exists on the promise of rhizomatic approaches design thinking in creative educational programmes [@biffi_chasing_2017-1]. However researchers identify significant competencies required including to "identify and synthesize the body of technical and even complex knowledge into a feasible structure" [@biffi_chasing_2017-1, p. 972], which are not well-aligned with the age group of this context.

So instead of rhizomatic design, I propose that the tools, process and the community in this study mutually encourage an improvisational approach often referred to as _jamming_. While the processes identified are often improvised, there is a group element of the process where makers pick up techniques from other makers in the group. I suggest that such _jamming_ can be facilitated as a way of encouraging co-development of practices and making styles as proposed by Gutiérrez and Rogoff [@gutierrez_cultural_2003]

Restrictions in creativity are important here. The restricted genre, pixel art format and templated approach act not only as technical  scaffolds but also aligns with research on the value of constraints in facilitating rapid creative improvisation in the areas of music and drama. The domains of programming, game jams and hackathons also use constraints in a similar way [@gabler2005prototype].

Game Jams are accelerated events encouraging creative collaboration and innovation. While the event's premise is to promote collaboration, these events are inconsistent in their support and scaffolding of collaborative approaches [@goddard_playful_2014]. Game jams often prize innovation and originality. Recent research posits that Game Jams can be profitably used in formal education contexts [@aurava_game_2021], although there is scant guidance on how to address potentially problematic issues (list these). A complementary approach would be to significantly adapt the overall Game Jam format and to add greater scaffolding to the process as in the learning design of this research. Jamming in a musical context on the other hand takes place within an introduced but ideally familiar frame work. In musical terms this may be improvising around a familiar popular song, here it is adapting a template of a familiar game genre.

WRAP UP SOMEHOW ?

In the conclusing chapter I propose that this exploring these process can have value in other areas of digital making, and beyond.


<!-- There are disparate resources available for game jams but due to the adult centric audience and mix of abilities they are less guided in nature than many supported design processes aimed at school age audiences. -->

<!-- Within the concept of jamming, activity which is casual seemingly non-productive can still transmit useful information to guide collaborative practices. As per above and examples in Appedix ? Find. -->

<!-- This section discusses some of the outcomes stemming from interventions and emergent participant responses in the area of peer and individual working practices. -->

<!-- In Chapter 5, one of area of contractions was the dysfunctional group work which was freed up by allowing greater atomisation and greater scaffolding of tool use. -->

<!-- Some barriers stemming from alienation from participant group working processes were resolved partly by freeing up some patterns of collaboration and interaction and removing others.

The process of parents getting in the way of children's not minding jumping in and invading social space struck me. Together with the frustrations of complexities of larger group work the restrictions created a tension between the suggested community norm of how division of labour was organised.

Thus in P2, rather than the larger groups of P1, smaller groups, allowing some children to work by themselves and others with parents. Avoiding large group fragmentation and encouraging freedom of participation vs benefiting from parental involvement.

There is a flexibility here which is encouraged by informal moments of  playtesting

These tensions are mirrored in similar research and were highlighted in the practitioner interviews that I conducted.
 -->

<!-- DROP THIS - NOT CLEAR IF NOT REALLY PROPOSED AS A NAVIGATIONAL STRATEGY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.
In a closer review of key literature claims of of the value for participants of following design cycles are implied but not supported. Instead stages is are proposed as a tool to "discusses strategies for designing new technologies" [@resnick_all_2007, p. 2]. The following writing discusses the value of flexible approach to design processes observed in my research. -->




#### The potential of open / creative spaces to facilitate emergent social and cultural activities in evolving idioculture - MOVE LATER/ JUST A SIGNPOST TO LATER - PARK, FOR NOW?

**It is of value to create spaces to leverage the potential of in-between moments for participants - playtesting or non-productive**

<!--
Note Dropped Faff time.  -->

<!-- SO IS THIS IN RELATION TO CHALLENGING DESIGN STAGE PARAGDIM
I noted in analysis of data that along with frustration there are also moments of creativity, and there are bonding moments which appear to be helped by this activity which is at times quite unfocused but also shared.  -->

To support the development of emerging practices I introduced, social missions, drama frame and concepts of maker types.

In retrospect, many of the social missions explored above encouraged activity outside of established design stages. For example the lively discussion about game playing in response to the mission to _find out the favourite games of 3 other people_.

The process of swapping graphical assets used a shared Piskel gallery and games area which served to keep individuals informed in directly of progress being made, and to spark curiosity in the creations of others.

In addition, I observed that navigating these essential but non-creative tasks in a collaborative and playful way can reduce learner anxiety and help maintain a positive affect to the overall creative digital process. This observation is supported by an example in the next chapter available in appendix 5.x - an extract of which is included below.


In summary, it is of value to create spaces to leverage the potential of these in-between moments for participants.
ALSO TRUE OF PLAYTESTING

The potential impact on agency is as follows; If these tasks can be seen as more than mere barriers to production, and therefore to be designed out to increase instrumental agency, then there is potential to increase relational agency through flexible divisions of labour that allow the incorporation of home roles in to this new learning space. Thus a potential affordance to find identify and specialism here.

This a concept is developed later in this discussion.

## Conclusion

<!-- Participants are able to use the affordances of the existing learning design and add their own evolving practice to them as a way of expressing and building agency. -->

<!-- **Practical** -->
### Implications for practitioners - MOVE LATER?
<!--
RETURNING TO WHAT IS FOUND IN THE DATA - A CELEBRATION OF THE CONCRETE - AND UTITILY OF THE MID - LEVEL APPROACH -->

Returning to issues of inclusive approaches to pedagogy, the findings of this chapter resonates with Papert and Turkle's celebration of the process of concrete tinkering. They also suggest that it is potentially augmented, in terms of wider accessibility, with the use of design patterns as a germ cell concept. This approach is flexible and potentially responsive whilst still retaining a unifying pedagogical approach.

In many of the outlined uses of GDPs in chapter we can see processes at play that help bridge shifts in goals between activity systems and navigation between one sub-goal and the next. Any other analysis on the part of the participant can wait until the process becomes more familiar.

This approach is aligned to inductive research processes. Finding useful abstractions only after immersing ones-self in the detail. Previously abstract concepts or processes become concrete through familiarisation via direct use and indirect observations through community participation.

### Conclusion proper


The observations of this chapter show the advantages of GDP as an intermediate, relatable design framework, occupying a the space between too concrete to be repeated and too theoretical to be grasped by novice game makers. The use of GDP concepts can create a tangible link between concrete player experience and the affordances of a guided creative process. Learners use of GDP as relatable and flexible constructs that facilitate communication, sustaining engagement, planning and division of labour. On a cultural plane, using GDPs can aid the propagation of technical and social processes game making practices within an emerging community of learners. GDPs served both researchers and participants by _providing a common language_ to clarify first learner expression and researcher's analysis of gameplay experience. GDPs functioned as an _inspirational structured design tool_ .

<!-- **What are the limits of the claims of this research?** It is important to recall the purpose and limitation of these figures outlined in Chapter 4, that this is not designed to claim efficacy of the learning design or to be representative of an average participant (which would require follow up studies of different design). -->


NEXT CHAPTER?  The utility of a patterns and their collection as a form _intermediate-level knowledge_ by both researchers and participants  is shown in part by in a growing sense of mastery towards technical processes becoming second nature and the resulting ability to share them with family and other peer groups.

<!-- **Theoretical** -->
On a theoretical plane, this chapter has outlined the evolving use of GDPs as a meditational strategy to develop coding repertoires that are often shared. CHAT frames diverse use of shared resources and concepts, in this case GDPs, as meditational strategies which can involved into repertoires of practice [@lecusay_telementoring_2015; @gutierrez_learning_2019-1]. These concepts and this framing of learning as participation in community repertoires, are explored in the next chapter in relation to participant agency using examples that extend beyond the use of GDPs to other cultural processes. While the development of agency has not been the primary focus of this chapter, the processes of community adaptation of GDP use can be directly linked to conceptions of transformative agency explored in Chapter 4. The next chapter explores cultural aspects in greater detail continuing to explore emergent agency in this research.

<!-- **Transition to next chapter on agency** -->

<!-- Examples of this dynamic agency include the use of graphical code structures, asking for peer or facilitator support etc. -->
<!-- While the process of direction may be less totally learner-driven approach than the first iteration of the learning design P1, working with a starting menu of game patterns with support still provides challenges to learners and complexity of working processes. Design blockages still occur, and participants have to work with facilitators in depth to overcome issues. There is the possibility to adapt existing patterns, to add new patterns from outside the curated collection or to shift to new game paradigm requiring a different set of patterns altogether. -->



<!-- THIS PERHAPS IS FOR CONCLUSION? This can be understood in relation to relevant socio cultural theory in the following way, affordences, mutual tool development, FoI, etc. -->

 **Discussing Game design patterns as a tool to expose and give participants a language to discuss and resolve tensions (Practitioner focus)**

 This section;
 - synthesises examples which highlight the value of developing share language and short cuts
 - explores possible drawbacks
 - looks at restricted

 Examples of short cuts include, "get an enemy in", animate player from Ed and Ma's exerpts.

 The advantages of such shortcuts are, as discussed to help with the prioritisation and ideation processes, to facilitate peer propagation of ideas, and potentially to inform debugging and improvements to increase game playability.

 However, there are challenges of the use of such short cuts including;
 - hiding more complex patterns within the name.
 - confusion over use of terms to new comers

 For example the shortcut of a name for a pattern in Ed and Ma's interaction hides a large amount of problems solving which seems "overwhelming" -->

Blunden cites the process of identifying a germ cell of activity as a fruitful process for researchers [FIND].

<!-- MOVED EARLIER HERE - Check it fits? In the literature review and methodology chapter we examined different interpretations of agency used by researchers using activity theory [@hopwood_agency_2022].  -->

<!-- DROP? We can ask where does knowledge of GDPs in participant come from. Good games communicate their affordances, (in the form of GDPs) to the player without the need for extensive additional documentation [@gee_learning_2005]. This process also communicates GDPs implicitly to players, a process borne out by brainstorming sessions early in the process which say participants listing GDPs or variants of them without explicit guidance in this direction. This  goal setting and implementation using GDP as a base developed into a principle activity of P1 with varied results. -->

<!-- In addition to support their identification of the different elements that make up a game I created a sheet which drew on existing work framework (mechanics, space, goals, etc) to scaffold the process. -->

<!-- THERE IS OVERLAP HERE WITH THE LAST CHAPTER - HOW TO REMOVE THAT AND RETAIN CLARITY ?

AT provides a concept of rising to the concrete which invites analysis of how the construct of  GDPs can be be adapted to serve the development of a game making community at different scopes of activity. To illustrate this concept we can use Marx's concept of exchange as a germ-cell for analysis of capitalism.  -->
<!-- The previous chapter described the  key elements of the learning design that were in place by P2 ( remixing from a game template, use of distributed asset creation showcasing and social playtesting).

### MOVED FROM GUIDED PARTICIPATION

<!-- Patterns and the multiple actions and operations they entail are referred to briefly using short cut names.   -->


<!-- Discussion later or before??? Maps -
GDP are already being used as a way to set goals, track progress and prioritise but the process seems stressful or unsatisfactory.

<!--
We can compare this drawn out process with a more rapid prioritisation guided by a parent with more experience in software development. Toby and Dan  are discussing possible features early in the process if ideation.

They thinking of a feature – wrap around like Pac-man
Dave  – Yeah we can do that. Save that for version 1.1

<!-- This pattern completion is mirrored in the work of other pairs. Thus replicating is a kind of participation in an emerging community.
There is also a link made by the parent to previous working practices. Using a paper book to make a sketch of the work to be completed. -->
<!-- These kinds of shifts of activity and cultural practices brought by the participants also feed into the ongoing culture of the game making community. For example the use of paper designs and paper prototyping that for some of the home ed families was a familiar practice was something that I adopted more broadly after observing the families involved. -->

MOVED FROM DISCUSSION
**A tension in use of norming practices and participant choice?**

<!-- MOVE THIS TO NEXT CHAPTER DISCUSSION?
However, as a seeming counterpoint to this growing agency is the norming effects of concepts that gain community currency in playtesting. The repeated attempts by participants to make the jumping mechanic of Madiha less frustrating can be seen as a potential drag on the agency or autonomy of Madiha as a designer. However this may be a false dichotomy. Such norming practices can be seen from a different perspective according to Rogoff, as a productive nudge to get real.
 IS THIS EXPLORED IN THE NEXT CHAPTER? -->

### Future work on abstraction, layers of abstraction GDPs and the MDA framework

**Move to conclusion or appendix? - appendix for now?**

Levels of abstraction and shifting perspectives also exist in formal analysis of game design frameworks [Salen, and MDA].
In the theoretical underpinning, Aesthetics are the first experience of the user, and the designer most closely aligned with mechanics. Could awareness of this their shifts in perspective in relation to this MDA framework be helpful to novices.

Could link between the MDA framework and main areas of GDPs can be used to deepen a possibly profitable connection to professional design lenses theory practices?

This learning design could be a good base to use to answer those questions.

## Impact of Side Missions and Maker Types on playtesting behaviours


#### Reflection on impact on my design process

<!-- Thus my role as a responsive facilitator rather than a instructor was key to this process.  -->
<!-- opens up flexibility in the way learners approach the design processes. -->
<!-- imagined, often in response to community need, by myself, the following emerged from community use. -->
START WITH A NARRATIVE?
My role as a learning designer under went some significant evolution.
As an example the quick start activities created by PGCE students were much more directive than I initially proposed in P1. It is not that the structuring was antithetical to my approach, more that the area was unfamiliar in terms of common heuristics, and the interweaving of gameplay features and underlying code structures.

Observations of and reflections on playtesting in p2, showed that participants still engendered a diversity of experience, from these shared beginnings.

An additional reflection on design is that the playtesting of participants revealed evidence of different motivations driving activity in game making sessions.


#### Observations on making styles
This section returns to game making types explored in Chapter 5. TO DEVELOP

For examples in the Vignette of S and T's interaction we can see attributes of the child as a Glitcher. In terms of understanding of the game as a dynamic system, this is seen clearly in the parent's alarm at the child's deletion of all elements of hazard. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. "It's no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid." The child seems determined to remove all hazards. My understanding is that she is also aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play.


Other players created impossible or overly easy game levels. They seem to take pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context. The process mirrors play theory concept of playing against the game or dark play [@sutton-smith_ambiguity_2001].

The process of exploring identity via side missions in this way surfaced the cheekiness of some young people and the pleasure they took in demonstrating their playful mischievousness. I began to make journal notes on this subject and talk to other games study practitioners. I began to ask the question can the surfacing maker types (as per player types) encourage awareness and celebrate the emerging practices that the community was producing.



#### A focus on the value of changing roles - especially peer teaching as reinforcing learning

A role or style that is not fully captured is that of peer learning, although it is implied within the socialisers and magpie makers.

CAN THIS BE ADDED INTO THE CODING SCHEMA

### Discussion on making types and side missions

THIS WOULD NEED MORE DISCUSSION OR INTRODUCTION - PLAYER TYPES NOT IN CHAPTER 5 ANY MORE

Begin discussion with reference to [@gutierrez_cultural_2003] on "Helping Students Learn: Having Styles or Participating in Practices", and a careful statement to avoid over generalisation here, but at the same time recognise the value of emerging practices and styles.

Thus I am not suggesting that these styles make up a ridgid typology to be replicated in other settings, instead, in line with Gutierrez and Rogoff [-@gutierrez_cultural_2003, p.20] , that the process of co-constructing understanding and communication about learning styles can "support the changing nature of participation and the forms of assistance provided in joint activity."


### Discussion on Player types -

DATA REQUIRED FROM VIDEO!?

The process of exploring identity in this way surfaced the cheekiness of some young people and the pleasure they took in demonstrating their playful mischievousness. I began to make journal notes on this subject and talk to other games study practitioners. I began to ask the question can the surfacing maker types (as per player types) encourage awareness and celebrate the emerging practices that the community was producing.

As an example some players created impossible or overly easy game levels. They appeared aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play. They seem to take pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context. The process mirrors play theory concept of playing against the game or dark play [@sutton-smith_ambiguity_2001].

Below I outline how I designed to encourage this behaviour.

My rationale for this process was to promote awareness of pluralistic programming process [@papert_epistemological_1990].

I wanted to try to communicate a message to participants that when you are learning something hard it is of value follow your own working preferences and try to discover a creative style that suits you.

Limits of discussion findings - what to put in

### Limitations of observations and careful statements of potential

It is important to highlight several aspects of the limitation of the exploration of maker types and side missions designed to support them.

This work is limited, as are other observations by the limited number of participants,. It is also perhaps guided by my own motivations as a researcher to investigate more messy approaches to learning.

However, given the potential of my observations and the link with existing research in other domains. It is reasonable to propose the processes outlines as a potentially fruitful area for further research. I explore potential dimensions of that research in the concluding chapter.

MoE being one of those directions.




<!-- In early stages the mutual work to produce resources, techniques and practices to share and evaluate these shared elements became a primary focus of my work, just as the implementation of game elements was the focus of the work of participants. -->

<!--
MOVE TO CHAPTER 7

In appendix 5.playertypes, I outline the use of a game to explore different game playing types. I then proposed different making types. I used the question "What kind of game maker are you?" as an indicator to participants that one aim of the project was to create a space where different approaches are possible and celebrated.

![Illustration 4.x - What kind of game maker are you  ](./Pictures/kindofgamemaker.png){width=95%}

To communicate this approach, as well as starting game activity, I incorporated the question into an animation of the resources home page (see illustration 4.x). In P3 the underlying ideas were incorporated into the process drama described in the next section.
 -->

<!-- MOVE THIS CLAIM LATER.
**Claim:** The data in this chapter shows the value and further potential of mixing the more mature techniques of MoE and other process drama techniques with the ethos of game jams. -->


### Emerging use of narratives and graphics which drawing on home funds of knowledge  - AVOID OVERLAP AND CHANGE FOCUS TO AGENCY FROM START

NOT REALLY ONLY TO DO WITH PLAYTESTING.

RECAP WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLORED,
In the previous chapter,



**While the potential to add graphics was a core affordence of the starting processes of the templated game, the process of designing and sharing and the peer commentary on the process emergered as the sessions evolved.**

The literature review outlined the potential of home interests as funds of knowledge, especially informal learning. This learning design provided participants with different ways to input and explore their home interests in the narrative and graphical elements of their created games. For example the choice of game characters allowed the expression of identity. Other designed elements for example audio and graphical effects or written messages added to the overall aesthetic or polish of the game.

Video evidence indicated that conflicts involved between learner expectations and their technical abilities are helped by the use of the starting template. The
constraints of provided game elements and implied narrative structure of the template accelerated the initial creative process.

<!-- (like a  musical style from which to jam from, or provided constraints in a drama process which help guide improvisation.) -->

One pair Clive and Pearl, the grandparents of Toby, included a narrative message at the start of their game. This process surfaced the expertise of the family as beekeepers, sparking interesting conversations with other participants.

     var starttext = "This is a game which pits a honey bee against a swarm of Asian hornets,  which are alien invaders attacking bee  hives in the UK and which beekeepers are trying to stop spreading  here. Try to guide the bee to collect all the flowers without being caught by the hornets.
     Use the arrow keys to move the bee. Press return to START.";

<!-- In a noteworthy exchange a young participant Zi asks one of the grandparents of child if they had done any amazing things in their life. This exchange follows

   zi: Have you done amazing things?

The exchange seems to throw Pa but they draw Zi's attention back to the game. Showing that it demonstrates their interest in bees as they are beekeepers.

The source of Pa's hesitancy to share more is not clear. However her willingness to share that part of her personal story via the narrative of the game is shown here as is the willingness of the young participant to ask about the personal experiences of the older participant during the process of peer testing her game. -->

In another example, Mark and Ed designed a game around the character of a train driver that needed to collect coal. In subsequent post course interview Mark describes the impact of the child feeling like they could bring their own identity and interest into the project. "I know just your eyes lit up when you realised you could expand your interests into gaming." See Appendix 4.x (Mark and Ed working with home interests)

<!-- The process of creating assets builds in Madiha the identity of a proficient maker. She wants to build on her achievement of being an "expert pixel".  -->



<!-- NOTE
NARRATIVE / drama IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER?
how do these two sections work together? remove this one?
 -->
<!-- The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;] BRING ON OTHER LITERATURE HERE ON PERSONAL EXPRESSION, FUNDS OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA. Roque, Scratch, Kafai, Gee etc. -->

<!-- Ideally look for evidence of sharing in communities, especially developing processes, avoiding traps which sap momentum, -->

<!-- While these aspects are covered in other literature, and are therefore not covered in depth in this chapter, it is important to include their strong presense in the data of study. And to situate them in relation to other chapter contents. HOW EXACTLY. -->
