# The Use of Gameplay Design Patterns "It’s like a project in itself, really"

## Research Questions - March 2024

1. What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to participation in game coding processes?
2. How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?
3. How can learners build agency in an evolving community of game makers?


<!-- ## Notes to restructure

Really address  the community aspect of the RQ - and highlight that this is why personal elements are not explored in more detail

In each section if there are multiple aspects of that then put into headings  - and put this into the coding structure for data review

Examine overlap of the cultural uses of GDP, and the next chapter - hand in hand here get an overview of what needs to extracted from the data and where it sits

Also work out what to move to Lit Review - and restructure LT and Methodology based on two chapters near completion. -->

<!-- **On GDP as a germ-cell and unit of analysis recap of design patterns** -->
<!-- In the introduction of this thesis, I outlined some of the broader challenges of sharing practice and research to practically support the learning of coding practices beyond the immediate context of the research in question. The choice of what scope of activity to examine in detail is relevant to this challenge.  -->

In the previous chapter, I outlined the evolution of tool use, emphasising emerging tensions in activity. This chapter shifts focus to the perspectives of participants, using recorded data to interpret the varied applications of gameplay design patterns (GDPs). In doing so, it addresses the research question: How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices by novices? Chapter 2 summarised software  design patterns as a grouping of a description of target project behaviour, with a suggested community solution of code structure often accompanied with worked examples. While existing research explores the use of game design patterns in educational settings, for instance to aid the transfer of science simulation concepts to other contexts [@repenning_scalable_2015; @basawapatna_using_2010] or as a foundation for co-design work [@eriksson_using_2019], there is limited work addressing their role in overcoming challenges faced by emerging communities of game creators using text coding. The last chapter investigated iterative activity involving alterations to games at the level of gameplay design patterns as part of the mutual evolution of learning design. This evolution encompassed various forms, including supporting resources such as code examples, instructional tutorials and quick-start activities proposing micro-level code modifications. This chapter builds on that analysis, focusing on the use of GDPs in diverse mediational strategies, not only within facilitator-provided resources and scaffolds but also as part of emerging community practices and interpersonal repertoires. During data analysis, GDPs appeared in such diverse and significant forms that they became candidates for a germ cell concept.

Regarding the structure of this chapter, it begins with a vignette of parent-child interaction during the game-making process to contextualise the findings that follow. The chapter then presents a systematic analysis of participants’ varied uses of game design patterns, drawing on detailed observations of recorded video data. For this analysis, I employ Rogoff's three planes of analysis [@rogoff_observing_1995], as introduced in Chapter four. Recognising that these observations do not neatly align with the three planes, I discuss the use of GDPs across cultural activities, interpersonal activity and personal knowledge in three distinct sections. These sections focus on how gameplay design patterns are utilised by parents, children and facilitators, each through the lens of the respective analytical plane. An analogy can be drawn between these three planes of analysis and the examination of activity systems at varying scopes. Specifically, the cultural plane aligns with the community scope of activity described in Figure 5.x in the previous chapter, while the interpersonal and personal planes correspond to smaller scopes depicted in Figure 5.x. A discussion section explores the implications of these findings in relation to existing research and theoretical concepts. This discussion considers the examples of GDP use in practice to analyse GDPs as a mid-level construct, demonstrating their utility for both educational designers and researchers.

<!-- NOTE - IN CHAPTER 4 - OR HERE - MAKE THE LINK BETWEEN THE THREE PLANES AND THE UNITS OF ANALYIS . -->

<!-- The following sections explore the variety of uses. A final section of this chapter analysis how this proposition of GDP as germ cell fits within a CHAT analysis.    -->


<!-- These include: use as part of meditational strategies by participants and facilitators and as shared objects between participants, facilitators and peers -->

<!-- While these approaches are  distinct in their pedagogical use, they stemmed from the same germ-cell activity of altering the game through the use of game design patterns via varied means.  -->

<!-- -  design patterns in learning design which exist at different scopes of activity [@mcandrew_patterns_2006].(CHECK THIS) -->
  <!-- - how design patterns interplay with design principles and how the process relates to design based research  [@linn_science_2006]. -->
<!-- While this concept of germ cell / unit of analysis a is more typically used in a larger scope of societal activity, the principles apply this smaller scope.  -For a study of this nature, too broad an analysis risks insufficient detail to allow replication, too narrow risks being overly context dependant and limiting the potential for wider application. -->

## Initial broad commentary on Vignette 2

In this section, I provide an overview of the specifics of the learning design and participant interactions. Beyond providing the reader with an illustrative example of partner work in game coding, this commentary begins to surfacing uses of GDPs as a meditational strategy, which are then explored using wider data in the rest of the chapter. To achieve this, I use a vignette to capture a snapshot of the interactions within one family, as it includes several aspects of activity that incorporate the use of GDP concepts. A truncated table presents participant dialogue, screenshots and a description of their interactions, including gestures, followed by a summary interpretation of these interactions. A more extended extract of dialogue, activity description and commentary is available in Vignette 2 in the appendices.

### Short Descriptive Commentary on Vignette 2

For the preceding ten minutes, the parent and child dyad had been struggling with a tutorial chapter in the textbook, included as Appendix.tech.samplechapter, which explains how to add the pattern of keys and doors. In this pattern, players must collect a key and then navigate to a door to progress to the next level. The parent, Suzanna, had been making multiple changes to the code while the child, Olivia, expressed boredom. Suzanna then suggested that Olivia ask the facilitator, Mick, for help in resolving the coding issue. Once the bug was resolved, Suzanna handed the keyboard to Olivia to test the now working game.

**Skilful parental work to sustain engagement**

The parent takes action to involve her child in the design process when technically possible and to incorporate her child's interests. The full arc of the vignette, the parent overcomes her own hesitancy regarding asking for facilitator help by sending out her child to ask. When the code problem has been solve, she signals clearly to her child to return to the design process. This indicates that she is aware of the greater possibility for effective child input at these moments. After a blockage caused by debugging coding is removed, the parent immediately re-engages the child prompting the child to play-test the game.

The parent struggles to implement quite ambitious code challenges that she takes on but signals clearly when the process returns to a state suitable for ideation and design within the scope of the child. The completion of a coding task indicating that she is aware of the greater possibility for effective child input at this stage. The parent navigates the process skilfully and is able to elicit and then incorporate the child's interests in a variety of ways.


**Challenge and initiative**

The child also show initiative, in particular in relation to level design. There is an awareness of and playfulness surrounding the conventions of a platformer game as a dynamic system in way which drives their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game.  An understanding of the game as a dynamic system is seen clearly in the parent’s alarm when, shortly after this interaction, the child deletes all elements of hazard in one level.


**Lingua franca**


The implementation of a new game design pattern (GDP) involve adding new code to the game. The amount of code and/ changes needed varied depending on its complexity. Larger changes typically need more careful manipulation of code and subsequent debugging.

The child(c) Olivia uses the name of game design pattern they are working in _Keys and Doors_ in the process of encouraging her parent(p) Suzanna to get started on it (Key 44 in Vignette 2).

The key and door pattern is one of the harder ones to implement. Olivia is one of the younger participants and the parent Suzanna has taken on the role of solving harder code problems and in doing so has built important proficiency in coding practice.

There is evidence that the Olivia(c) is building a connection to the game making pattern in (Key 12 in Vignette 2) abbreviations of the names of GDPs, _Key and Door_ and _Levels_, are repeated in a sing song voice and the positioning of the Key and Door pattern as a challenging in the session start orientation outlined in Vignette 11 provokes a strong reaction.  


**Transition**

The use of GDPs terms  as a lingua franca, a concept underpinning the utility of design pattern more generally [@erickson_lingua_2000], to help design for others is explored in the next section. More broadly the use of GDP concepts as an evolving design language to give feedback, to share knowledge, request and for other uses during community activity,  pair interactions and individual work are explored in following sections.

## Use of GDPs in the cultural plane / community level of activity

Following Rogoff's [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes approach of analysis , the following section explores the use of GDPs at at community plane of activity. While Rogoff's early analysis of activity on a cultural plane focused on the metaphor or apprenticeship, focusing on an already existing community, later work with Gutiérrez [-@gutierrez_cultural_2003] has a greater focus on cultural activity as dynamic, examining existing and emerging norms and repertoires adapted from participants presence in other communities.

### The role of GDPs to facilitate learners to design for others

<!-- NOTE - ALSO LINKED TO IDEATION? - is this guided participation? -->

**The use of GDPs (especially during playtesting) can aid the process of imagining end user experiences**

This section examines how the concept and experience of implementing GDPs provoked participants to imagine the experience of end users of their game. Chapter 2 explored the proposal of professional and participatory design processes is that design should be informed by end user experience [@redstrom_towards_2006] , and the challenges involved in undertaking such a "operationalization of empathy" [@surma-aho_conceptualization_2022, p.1]. Taking a CHAT interpretation, this process involves shifts in perspectives from participants as they engage with objectives on different scopes of activity. For example, in the vignette above Olivia(c) persues a quirky design goal during her pair design work, which Suzanna(p) resists. Imagining a the shift in perspective to the imagined audience at a community level of interaction, the parent is keen to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player.

Suzanna shares _"Must be quite hard to get through that door._" when Olivia places the exit door high above a platform. She then continues - _“It’s no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid.”_ Olivia(c) seems determined to remove all hazards. _"It is for me!"_ she counters. She may be aware of the implications for game balance but takes pleasure in this destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play.

A later interaction with a peer shows that she is indeed imagining the experience of the immediate audience of fellow game makers and supporting students. _"I like making it frustrating. that other people find it frustrating!"_. Olivia(c) notes the persistence of a student helper who pushes past her frustration to complete the game. Her remark "If people tried hard they would get to my level" shows her awareness of that not all players will persist in the same way to reacj her final level which has only rewards and no hazards. This being a "secret, special" experience which plays against the norms of platform game design, thus intended to provoking player surprise.

<!-- While Suzanna(p) imagine a user experience and make a playable game conforming to her perception of norms, Olivia's(c) playful imagining of the experience of a more immediate audience of fellow game makers and supporting students appears to provide a tangible motivation with rapid rewards.

<!-- There are different levels of designing for others

**There are other examples of how concepts of game challenge and other aspects of gameplay experience evolved through informal feedback during playtesting and served to influence peers to modify their games to increase the enjoyment of peer players.**

The discussion of game challenge, specifically comments about how 'hard' participant games were a particularly common interaction during playtesting. Vignette.challenge outlines an key interaction which demonstrates norming behaviour towards Molly(p) who has concentrated on the graphics of her game to the detriment of level of challenges, in particular the controls of the game are frustrating. The vignette shows varied attempts to influence Molly to change  the game variables to make the gameplay less frustrating. They praise the look of the game but offer feedback on the experience of the game mechanic of jumping. While the players do not tell Molly directly to change the game, these comments appear to direct direction of the design to comply with an emerging community norm of how a player jumps should feel stemming from the participants feedbcak on the feeling of lack of control over the player's character in the game.

These norming behaviours some of the informal norming behaviours that are less directive seen in the work of Rogoff and colleagues as explored in literature review [@rogoff_cultural_2003].


<!-- children come and play Molly's game but only for less than a minute before leaving. While their feedback is non verbal the very short length of time that some of them spend is noticeable.  After the last one leaves Molly comments "It's so frustrating."  -->

**Ending / Transition - Other examples and interpretation on designing for others / shifts of perspective**

Returning to the complexity of Suzanna and Olivia's interaction which involves negotiation over the imagined experience of others involves the use of GDPs concepts.

GDPs aid the overall process of design for others by providing discreet and clear goals which are nested in the wider goal of making an engaging game.

In interpreting data there were other examples of pair partners and peers either commenting on or suggesting to others that they should imagining others user experience to suggest game design alterations.

### GDPs facilitate the use of wider funds of knowledge / interest

**GDPs allow participants to share and explore their home and professional funds of knowledge and practices in the emerging learning community.**

<!-- [Be sure to explore context further and put in intro]. -->

One premise driving my exploration in the use of gameplay features as a feature in pedagogy is that the tacit knowledge of gaming conventions of most family members is extensive even if they are not avid gamers due to the extensive influence of video game culture and experience into mainstream culture including contexts of family life [@ito_hanging_2010; @livingstone_digital_2018], in particular retro gaming [@heineman2014public]. As such, the process of facilitating ways of surfacing and working gwith such tacit knowledge aligns with Moll's concept of funds on knowledge, and if aligned, funds of identity [@fasso_identity_2020; @esteban-guitart_funds_2014]. Within a CHAT framework these funds of identity and knowledge can be seen as tools which facilitate the transfer of potentially useful concepts across the boundaries between activity systems, in this case between home activity and that happening in this game making community, with the associated inclusive benefits of working with participants home interests explored by Barron [@barron_conceptualizing_2010; @barron_interest_2006-1] and similar work by Gutiérrez on third spaces [@gutierrez_developing_2008]. Existing research outlines motivations of social making incorporating gaming cultural elements [@ito_hanging_2010; @gee_what_2003] and the ability to make personalised game assets narratives, sustain engagement in digital making projects [@sefton-green_mapping_2013].


In the last chapter I outlined processes facilitating participants could to create and incorporate graphical, audio assets and narratives elements into their games and, referencing Appendix. briefly outlined how these elements were themed as _Game Polish_ items within a typology of GDPs which aligned with the MDA (mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics) game element framework explored in Chapter 2. Addressing the aspect of patterns aesthetics, in Vignette 5 Molly and Nadine showing identification with graphical making process and the process of bringing it the game. Beyond their internal family interaction, they share this artistic flair and attention to detail into the emerging learning community.

In addition to issues of aesthetics explored in the section above, home knowledge game mechanics and dynamics, the M and D of the MDA framework also contributed to emerging cultural repertoires. Addressing experiences of game dynamics, as explored in the previous section, Vignette 4 gives several examples of how feedback of participants on the dynamics of Molly's game during playtesting. INSERT OTHER STATS FROM CODING?

Turning to game mechanics, in part two of Vignette 7, Bertie comments on Toby's game which has a dominant game experience of timed jumping: _"It’s like parkour in Minecraft but timed. It’s like playing the game Wipeout. Have you ever played Wipeout?"_. Parkour in Minecraft and Wipe out are both game experiences whose main gameplay mechanic is about judging jumps to landing accurately. Bertie makes links to his existing experience of games making comparisons between Toby's game, commercial games and his own. In doing so Bertie is able to shows his knowledge and analysis of gameplay patterns.

A wider exploration of use of FOK in the programme related to art and narrative is explored in chapter six.

A potential similar specialism was evident from Dave's guidance of Toby to access professional documentation, and engage in debugging processes using the developer tools section of the web browser. (See appendix 5.x). As a facilitator, this aligned with my previous work with Mozilla web clubs. The enthusiastic sharing of for messing around with technical web tools for learning and fun.

This could have been picked up on and integrated into the design. While I did not do this, the confidence brought to the process to find resources from outside of teh walled garden of the provided resources prompted a change of game paradigm for another family who also made a top down / maze game in P3. -->

### Evolution and propagation of GDPs concepts during playtesting

<!-- NOTE NOT PLAYTESTING THAT IS IMPORTANT HERE - INSTEAD THE ROLE AND NATURE OF GDPS TO AID PROPAGATION -->
<!-- NOTE THIS includes NON TEMPLATED GDPs? -->



<!-- While GDPs were often demanded by pairs or individuals, and then in P2 a menu of suggested GDPs introduced by had a role, there is a community dimension in the way participants worked with the concepts and the concrete implementation of GDPs.   -->
<!-- In addition to the names of patterns as a lingua franca to comment on games during the process of playtesting, participants also    -->

Within the emerging idioculture of the game making sessions, and during playtesting in particular, the implementation of particular GDPs by participant pairs or individuals often spread through peer activity. Both documented (those part of provided resources) and novel GDPs (those introduced by participants) were transmitted between participants enriching the games of participants. At times participant were influenced by playing the games of others and at times they would request the direct help of peers to implement GDPs in their own games. In part two of Vignette 1, Toby's work adding 21 levels to his game is noticed by Bertie.

   Bertie: Why’s that enemy in every level
   Toby: He’s not.
   Bertie: Can you show me how you add more levels on to yours?
   Toby: Yeah sure.
   Pause
   Toby: I’m just going to have one go of beating this (refering to his own game which he is playtesing). It’s 21 levels in it. So .. Yeeeeah.
   Pause
   Bertie: It’s like parkours in Minecraft but timed. It’s like playing the game Wipeout. Have you ever played Wipeout?
   Toby: Er not really.
   Bertie: Or seen it?
   Bertie: That’s like my second level.
   Toby: Ah so hard (Toby fails at a high level on his game and starts to move off)
   Toby: (To someone else  calling for attention)  No I’m helping Bertie.
   _(Toby then follows Bertie to his workstation to help him implement more levels.)_


Other examples of propagating patterns include placing hazards in tricky places like a lava pit, the use of moving enemies and changes to jump dynamics.

<!-- NOTE ADD MORE EVIDENCE? -->

**Analysis:** This exchange shows the propagation of GDPs emerging FROM community playtesting very direct with the one asking another to help them directly. It is possible that Bertie's request to Toby is facilitated through noticed Toby helping Nadine and Harper add levels to their games. Toby's emerging roles as a specialist that the community can draw on, on a practical level, and similar examples,(see also that of Nadine in Vignette 5) were welcome as a way to reduce dependence on myself as a facilitator, or to provide an alternative to the instruction-based support documents.

<!-- The process of playing a game of another and sharing your appreciation of it invites participants to add new patterns to their own game. -->

<!-- ADD IN FREQUENCY IF POSSIBLE - A ROUGH APPROXIMATION OF WORKING PATTERNS IN P2. -->

<!-- A different pattern of propagation was that participants notice and comment on a game element or pattern during during playtesting, and then to use supporting resources or facilitator help to implement it. A less frequent pattern involved participants' diligent and deliberate use of supporting resources to identify and implement features without peer influence. -->



**New GDPs emerged from existing patterns through peer activity during playtesting**

In addition to the propagation of GDPs offered n the menu of supporting documentation, other gameplay patterns and related design concepts emerged organically from the community. For example, Olive's concept of a level that eschews challenge and offers only rewards, a type of bonus stage pattern,  emerged through playful experimentation (see Vignette 2). Similarly, the concept of safe zone in the game of Pearl and Clive arrived as a direct result of after adding a moving enemies GDP, the extensive use of that pattern dominates the game challenge to such an extent that it is essential for players to quickly identify and use 'safe zones'.
DEVELOP

These novelties may emerge spontaneously or have a source in  part participants' funds of gaming knowledge. In either case once the concept of safe zone or bonus level enters the linguistic and coding repertoire of this community of game makers, they may spread if other participants pick up on them. Even if other participants only noticed the use of GDPs and use approximate terminology to comment on them during playtesting, this form of activity can be seen as legitimate peripheral participation [@lave_situated_1991; @guzdial_imagineering_2006], and thus a helpful practice contributing to the emerging ecosystems of the learning community.

### Summary of cultural section - and signposting to next chapter

This section has explored the use of GDPs as within strategies and processes that occur at a community level in way which demonstrate the transfer between different activity systems in a way which supports the perspective of Gutiérrez [@gutierrez_developing_2008] regarding the importance of transcending borders and linguistic practices between sites of learning.  Playtesting a medium for an a shared idioculture to emerge and as such became a significant part of pedagogy of the learning design. While the design processes directly linked implementing GDPs were one of the most significant in video data others were present. The role of playtesting and other community interactions including warm up games, session reflections are explored in relation to the development of agency in the following chapter.


## GDPs used in the process of guided participation (Target 2500)

This section explores data on the use of GDP from the perspective of interpersonal interaction the process of being guided into planned activity or peer work which is exploratory but helps developing of interpersonal processes which serve the completion of the activity. From observations of video data, I observe how GDPs are used in diverse  meditational strategies by different participants.

<!-- In particular how , ideation, division of labour and prioritisation, and the adoption of technical processes intersect with the use of GDPs. -->

<!--
NOTE THIS HAS BEEN REMOVED
## The use of GDPs examined from an interpersonal focus
This section examines the use of GDPs to facilitate guided participation via interpersonal interactions in game making. Guided participation in this context involved, guidance on organising design activities, various forms of problem solving and help to shift design perspectives. While the primary source of material is from pair interactions between children and parents, at times peer interaction between non-pairs developed into guidance. For example, in the in the example above where Toby provides assistance for Bertie  in adding levels to his game

### GDPs and their grouping as a collection or menu of suggested options, offer the potential to assist project navigation, acting as a framework for code examples and step-by-step tutorials (600)

<!-- DRAW ON CHAPTER 4 MUTUAL EVOLUTION - AND FIND EXAMPLES . -->

**The use of a catalogue of design patterns addresses a tension of participants choice and the need for documentation to support the technical implementation of code structures. However, not all participants used provided instructions and develop diverse ways to access support to implement patterns.**

<!-- - RECAP DOCUMENTATION TENSIONS HERE WITH FOCUS ON AGENCY
- ALSO FOCUS ON MY ROLE AS A DESIGNER INTRODUCING DOCUMENTATION AND STRATEGIES (PERHAPS MAPS TOO IN LINE WITH 5TH D) -->

The tension between of participant choice and use and providing appropriate scaffolding materials to support implementation of code was explored in the previous chapter. The decision to base supporting resources around a menu of game design patterns was an end product of a mutual evolution.

Thus GDPs were chosen by myself as a suggested project navigation framework. Given the integration of this decision into the learning design from P2 onwards,  some of the observations which observer participants using this framework may appear as a tautology. In that it is no surprise that participant use the provided framework. However the evolving use of GDPS, the variations within that use and continued adaptation of GDP use merit attention.

My data does not capture this stage of the use of starting activities which selected key changes to code the P2 when participants used this resource. However I've used the cards and template game on many other groups and public events to replicate the very early stages of interaction. From journal notes on these repeated  observations,
Participants used both  printed resources and where possible direct forms of help between peer participants and any facilitators present.
other COMMENTs HERE

The vignette in this chapter shows the parent Suzanna's use of a step by step tutorial to address the child's objective of implementing chosen GDPs. Olivia is limited in her technical skills but leverages the concept of two GDPs in particular to persist in problem solving using the tutorial and trouble shooting using facilitator help. Given Olivia's limited computer literacy (explored later) the idea of the GDP is likely to be from a cultural source, most likely playtesting.   

By way of contrast, Vignette.toby showed the child shares an independent style with Suzanna but engages in lone working, copying a code from code snippet example of the game design pattern which he chose from a graphical menu of patterns. His independence in adding new features using supporting documentation without facilitator support helps him take on a mantle of a mentor inspiring and helping others add the same GDPs to their games.

OTHER DATA CALL HERE - Examples from the data of participants using GDPs as a framework for organisation and project navigations.

<!-- The previous chapter also described the use of starting activities which selected key changes to code or simplified design processes designed to maximise personalisation and changes to the starting game template. -->

These varied forms of documentation, and their varied adoption and propagation represent different approaches to  scaffolding the process of becoming familiar with and then modifying to the code in often increasingly ambitious ways inline with the stages and ethos of a use-modify-create (UMC) approach. [source]


<!-- NOTE ARE DIFFERENT APPROACHES BEST EXPLORED HERE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE? -->


Key characteristics of structuring support around quick start activities and a subsequent menu of GDPs which align with existing research include:

- supporting the value of informal approaches to learning technology [ITO etc] whilst avoiding the lack of support in P1 where participants called out for more support with technical and organisational processes.
- providing shorter, just-in-time tutorials
to reduce barriers associated with more extensive instruction-based approaches including barriers of literacy [@dietz_design_2021; @resnick_coding_2020].
- The use of a menu / collection of resources can be considered an inclusive educational practice and offer a rich description of a concrete example which aims to align to inclusive, practice-based frameworks like UDL and PBL. While this may involve more work in advance, the benefits to inclusive practice merit it.



<!--
At this phase of research documentation included; comment help within the game template; a step-by-step tutorial which build up the code of the starting template and explore the computing concepts, a menu of self-contained code examples of game elements game elements or game design patterns (GDPs); supporting tutorials briefly explaining how to add the new code needed to implement the patterns. -->



<!-- In addition, Direct help between peer participants, as outlined other section, was a key process of the game making community from early stages.
However, to overcome scarcity of facilitator support, direct help processes were seeded by other forms of support resources and written documentation. -->


<!-- #### Use of simple code examples which demonstrate the pattern in isolation -->
<!--NOTE DEVELOP THIS EXAMPLE - RELATE TO PRACTICE OF CODE PATCHING (EXPLORED IN PREVIOUS CHAPTER) -->
<!-- Code examples were initially the starting resource. The idea being it was quick to see the behaviour in context. The, use of code examples by Toby in 2019-05-08 shows the effectiveness of the use of code examples by participants.  -->


<!-- The timings of the process of patching the code show that the learner is hesitant in the process. He checks the code and then checks the game output to test that the code creates the desired behaviour. Once this is verified he progresses to copy and paste the code from the create function of the sample code to the create function of his own source code. -->


<!-- NOTE - PERHAPS INTEGRATE PART OF THE CODE PATCHING PROCESS FOR THIS SECTION -->

<!-- Towards the end of phase 1 I began to create code examples to illustrate of how particular commonly requested game features were implemented. These barebone game projects were hosted on a code playground. An online document in our shared google drive working space linked to these examples. I would help participants access this when they requested a certain feature. This list of game features began to grow. For phase one these code example were not particularly successful at increasing learner independence. There were differences in the code structure of their games and the examples and translation was not intuitive. -->



<!-- NOTE REMOVED
This section prioritises describing the code patching process using examples and guided instructions rather than the first principles.   -->


### GDPs used to scaffold ideation and organisation processes (800)

**GDPs are used in a variety of ways to guide the ideation process via restriction of choice in pattern collection, starting template includes core dynamics, visual code structures of GDPs suit rapid prototyping.**

The design chapter explored the tension between reduced choice of genre of game. In my journal notes and observations of the games created, I note that the provision of a graphical menu of GDPs significantly decreased in time spend in ideation phase by providing scaffolding and a restriction of choice. Analysis of participant use of the menu as detailed in the documentation section above Toby supports this analysis. Other techniques that leveraged the characteristics of game design patterns to support the ideation process emerged in community design activities.

<!-- The reduction on the length of the course was welcome show by Ma's comment. "It did go on for too long." -->


#### Knowledge of game design patterns used to stimulate and communicate new ideas

In the following example from vignette 7, home-base knowledge is utilised to help shape new design ideas and problem solving practices. Dave and Toby are working closely as a pair.  The following interaction shows a rich interchange where the parent is trying to draw on the game playing experiences to promote innovation in the design of the existing template.


<!-- THIS IS STRONGLY LINKED WITH IDEATION - PERHAPS MOVE THERE. -->

    Dave: Have you thought about pushing it a bit further and have a different style of game?
    Toby: What do you mean?
    Dave: Well the previous style of game was a platform (makes shape with hands) game wasn’t it? You went along and there was gravity pushing down (points down). There are other types of games aren’t there?
    Toby: Pause. I don’t know what to do thought.
    Dave: Well quite but what other games are there? again

Dave invites thinking outside of the constraints of the suggested design early in this first session. In this example the family bring their knowledge of game play patterns and genre conventions and more broadly experience and a perspective of coding as a creative challenge to the activity.

Additional interpretation in commentary in Vignette 7.

#### The use of GDPs to encourage intuitive and visual prototyping

<!-- NOTE - PERHAPS MOVE THIS TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER / METHODS? NOT GDP SPECIFIC? OR PART OF STARTING DESIGN -->

**Some GDPs allow the spacial exploration of design in a visual way that suits being mapped onto paper, or onto graphical software which allows for a similarly intuitive and rapid prototyping.**

The use of paper prototypes was one technique used by several parents to support their children to form and develop their design ideas. In our starting vignette the matrix helped the child design with little coding or literacy ability.

Later in their interactions the parent notices the child's difficulty in using cursor and delete/backspace keys to edit a matrix allowing level design. The parent provides a book with grid paper to allow the child to replicate the matrix. The parent is then able to transcribe the design to the code example while engaging the child by checking she has interpreted the design correctly.

![](./Pictures/vign_a_1.png)
![Graphical representation of code]({{ site.baseurl }}/Pictures/vign_a_1.png)

The way the code is structured has been chosen to allow a graphical analogue between the lines of code in the form of a comma separated array and the appearance of the resulting game output on the screen. The parent uses the graphical representation of design in the code template as a jumping off point to make a connection to home practice of sketching things out in paper. The process of turn the sketched into reality on the screen and sharing with others appears to be transformative in terms of the engagement level of the child.



<!-- NOTE - RETURN TO THIS IN ANALYSIS OF TADS - -->
<!-- - in planning stages the parent provides scaffolding to help the child.

-->

<!-- There are other examples of the use of paper prototyping of GDPs being used by parents to provide scaffolding for their children. When invited to share about their design process in a post session interview, Ed and Mark  also discuss the use of paper to clarify initial GDP ideas in interview data. When asked if they were able to Mark  prompts

    Mick: Tell me a  bit  how you came up with those aims in your game, in terms of coming up with a plan.
    Mark: What for the things that we need to do to it to finish it?
    Mick: Yeah. Oh, just even from the beginning point. How did you plan together as well?
    Mark: Well we started off on paper didn’t we. That's the first thing we did. I think it was a benefit actually. We, we did a lot of sketching didn’t we and a lot of brainstorming ideas and seeing and trying to test out whether it would work.

Later in the interaction, the parent outlines a different use of prototyping, that of sketching directly into software. For this pair, the child appears to prefer sketching directly into software. The father also appreciates potential problems of translating ideas from paper into a digital format.

    Mark: I was very excited by seeing Ed playing with this because it's interesting that everything doesn't have to be a paper and pen.
    It's nice to just for the kids to feel that they can sketch on Piskel straight off the bat without taking a tutorial or being told by an adult.  It's really intuitive and you just go straight into it.
    Mick: That's an interesting thing because in some ways it started off with people working on paper because I thought that would be really accessible. Yeah. And maybe it was through observations of people just going “Do you know what I’m just happy sketching on Piskel”.
    Mark: (Animatedly) The kids, all the kids I saw not just Ed.
    Mick: Digital sketching.
    Mark: Yeah.
    Mick: It seemed to have value in that you were just doing it in the same format that you would use for the game.

    Mark:   Yeah. I think it's really important. I think the pencil and pen thing just didn't work did it. We sketched... It's got its place. But it's, the kids weren't that interested in using the graph paper to block out Piskel. It didn't translate. It was just easier to block it out straight in software. -->

One pair's ideation helped by the use of a GDPs is the following example which shows Toby and Dave  are creating a new tilemap for a maze game. Toby is able to map existing knowledge of tools and home knowledge of the kid of game he is imagining to rapidly make revisions.

    Toby: Oo. Shall we try to make it (unintelligible). Cos in pac man you can go off the edge.
    Dave: and you wrap round the other way?
    Dave: Yeah, yeah. We can do that. Save that for version 1.1
    Toby continues making changes to the code design.
    Dave: What’s the theme? What are you drawing?
    Toby: What? I’m trying to make like a pac-man type thing.
    Dave: Alright. What if you sketched it on paper first? Or have you got it in your head?
    Toby: I’m just kinda going for it it. (laughs)
    Dave: Ok go for it, see what you get up to.
    Toby: I’ll leave a hole there.

As aligned with the learning design principle of rapid feedback, changes in the code which Toby is altering to impact on the new design pattern of a top down game, are immediately apparent in the preview window. As such, Toby does not feel the need to prototype on paper.

NOTE - ADD IN A SUMMARY OF THE POST INTERVIEW DATA from Mark and Ed TO UNDERLINE THIS POINT.

NOTE - TO DEVELOP AFTER MORE ANALYSIS OF VIDEO DATA.

The use of GDPs to scaffold the ideation process was a common pattern used by X of the Y sessions analysed.


### GDPs aiding the process of organisation and division of labour (1400)

<!-- NOTE - DIVISION OF LABOUR IS IN THE NEXT CHAPTER TOO - REWRITE BASED ON GDP ONLY CONTENT
CHECK FOR OVERLAP-->


GDPs feature in processes of organisation, prioritisation and division of labour in a variety of ways: working knowledge of different types of GDPs can help participants to divide work by working on different patterns or taking on project elements within patterns, use of GDP concepts as a lingua franca


<!-- The implementation of some GDP involved the use of different tools and activities. As learners build the familiarity with the component actions needed to implement design patterns, some start to specialise as they divide labour between pairs or peers. -->

**GDPs are used a lingua franca and as shortcuts by participants when organising and prioritising work**

<!-- NOTE mentioned by name and via verbal and physical descriptions as -->

<!-- Online version as table - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wLx8j9djYqJdZHwKJ09mmIDMYO7YqlMDhuHx2hiqpJI/edit -->

GDPs terms are frequently used to try to organise and prioritise game making activity.

In Vignette 5.d, where the parent Molly wants to export an image from the graphical editing tool and to import this into the game, shows an evolving use of some of the terminology that has been introduced partly by facilitator interventions and partly emerging organically through community interaction.

The terms here are used first to request help, and then to discuss emerging community norms.

OTHER DATA ON GDP AS LINGUA FRANCA AT VARIOUS STAGES.
<!-- In this interaction above which was used to illustrate Molly and Nadine's division of labour, the parent is focused on completing the action of creating a graphical asset of a hazard as part of the activity of adding the GDP of including a hazard into the game. -->

The following exchange from Vignette 4 between participants Ed and Mark shows the use of GDP concepts to help resolve a tension between a more chaotic style of working jumping from one goal to another and a parental motivation to prioritise work.

    Mark: I’ve brought the music, and also we could just concentrate on one thing and just change that. You know, keep working through.
    Ed: Yeah. I think I want to get an enemy in - oh no - my person animated.
    Mark: So you want to get your person animated that’s the main thing.
    Mark: Shall we concentrate on that and changing the platforms into something different?

The pair's initial listing of features is a brainstorming technique uses of the approximate names of of game design patterns (_get the person animated_, _get an enemy in_, _changing the platforms_, _make a theme tune_). The vignette analysis sees the parent _overwhelmed_ with the child's lack of focus on one pattern "that’s what I mean, you can’t just skip around like that".   He appears to be keen to quickly pick one pattern, then then work through the documentation on that pattern, a process he later refers to in interview data a _plodding_. At a different stage Mark is engaged puzzling over documentation on how to add animation to a character for some time. This results in Ed being blocked from progressing. In an exchange listed in Vignette 4, the child proposes dividing their labour informally, appearing to make a tactical decision allowing the father to specialise in GDPs that involve deciphering technical instructions, whilst he engages with a pattern that involves creating audio and graphical assets in a more experimental process. The use of GDPs concepts here is used in the young person's circumvention of a tension via his informal division on labour.

**Division of Labour**

Addressing division of labour more generally, participants worked mostly as pairs or individuals, alternating between community playtesting and pair/individual design work.

Turning to the use of GDPs specificall<!--
MOVE TO TECHNICAL IF NOT ALREADY HTERE
Playtesting also helped propogate emerging practices. For example, after testing Mi's game In the example above after comments on the jump speed Ed continues.

   Ed: How much jump speed to you have?
   Ed: Your jump speed is massive.
   Ed gives advice about tidying up the sprite outlines.
   Ed: for people with background like yours You can use the “cramping tool””
   Mark  and Ed then explain – SEE THEIR RECORDING
   So that the background is clearer.

While Ed has only just been introduced to the ability to "cramp". He is happy and able to share this useful tool with Mi. Theme -->y in DoL as an organisational strategy,  structuring work processes through implementing modular sub-projects in the form of GDPs can aid division of labour

<!-- Structuring code implementation on relatively small code stages of GDP implementation steers the production process towards relatively frequent iterations of design cycle. Specifically the design stages here typically involve; ideation, planning, implementation, testing and modification and sharing via playtesting. THIS IS EXPLORED IN THE NEXT CHAPTER SO DROP OR ONLY BRIEFLY REFERENCE. -->

Analysis of video data uncovered flexible way in which the participant divided the process of game making, often showing traces of home collaboration practices. For example, In vignette 2, Suzanna(p) and Olivia(c) relied on the parent to do the majority of code implementation and shared one computer. The pair also alternated between use of keyboard and mouse to give the child hands on experience when possible. In interview data the parent note "I resist the urge to fix things immediately when she struggles."

In an illuminating exchange, Olivia uses the name of a GDP within a request for her parent to take on a specific task within their making process.

     Olivia: Go on then. Key - Door - Person.
     Suzanna: Person?
     Olivia: Key Door Person.
     Olivia gestures with her hands to indicate that her mother is the person she is referring to.

The utterance by the child "Key Door Person"  work on the game design pattern called Keys and Doors to the adult.

The child appears to consider the level of complexity needed to add a new pattern into the code to be beyond her ability and thus directly delegate the task to her mother.

While, the parent took driving seat to overcome code blockages they were careful to then involve the child to input their design choices when solved.

After the child has delegated a coding task to her mother she undertakes other activities. At times her activities directly contribute to the main goal of game making. At times the parent asked the child to seek help from facilitator. On another occasion when the child appeared bored of waiting for parent to solve a code problem, she approached the facilitator to ask for help on behalf of the adult without prompting. At other times she engages more peripheral activities such as watching older children playtest each others games, or observing community activity from under the table.


<!-- Toby and Dan's pair process of accessing professional documentation also illustrated an aspect of their family learning culture.  -->

While in P2 when supported by grandparents Toby had worked mostly alone, in P3, he works as a pair with his father (Dan) in a  more guided practice. In several interchanges the father starts as a facilitator taking a lead from the direction of the child. As the child reaches the limits of their ability he begins to be more directive, by asking leading questions and testing existing knowledge. Finally, in order to complete the programming or research tasks beyond of the child's knowledge, the father is more direct in instruction, directing the research and proposing a coding solution for their new game design pattern. Dan's experience as a software engineer and volunteer at Coder Dojo (Glossary), in an interview extract he outlines being present to focus on facilitating learners to develop independently.

    I try never to touch the keyboard of who's there. If they are stuck on something I always tell them what to do. Even if it's then taken me five minutes to explain what a semicolon is. And point. _It's that key_. Because it was just, I could do it so effortlessly. I think I'm sure I put people off very quickly by "Dan did something really quickly. I don't know what it was.".


### Discussion on division of labour in the video data


**Leveraging the possibilities of emerging divisions of labour:**  While the context of the participants as families involved in home education makes any general claims difficult, these observations support  exist in other research in this domain. For example, research shows that children have the potential to help parents as technology brokers [@correa_brokering_2015]. In joint technology work parents can fulfil several,reciprocal roles including, collaborator, resource provider, learner, non-technical consultant and emotional support [@barron_parents_2009].

Thus, in response to the creative support that parents and siblings provide, facilitators should design learning environments to facilitate these possibilities. The work of Roque provides guidance for helpers in the process to support parents to value and feel confident these roles [@roque_im_2016] in a way which mirrors the use of helpers this phase of my study.

<!-- While these following observations are more generally inked to the overall design process rather than the specific note they are of value to RQ2 on developing agency. -->

While these examples involve GDPs others are explore in relation to development of agency in the following chapter. The examples above illustrate, part some of the varied strategies to  divisions of labour adopted by participants at times involving  complex tensions in activity. For example  Molly and Nadine reversed traditional helping relationship, and the child would reluctantly implement the parent's requested technical elements of GDPS but would pointedly not explain the changes made, seemingly taking pride in knowing something that her mother didn't. Similarly, while Olivia's activity away from the screen  while non-productive within the scope of technical progress, can be characterised as  legitimate peripheral activity of observation of community activity [@lave_situating_1991 ; @rogoff_learning_2014].  Indeed the possibility for children to _not_ engage in community activities is seen by Rogoff [-@rogoff_cultural_2003; -@rogoff_organization_2016] as an important characteristics in participation based models of learning.

The variety of repertoires of helping practice depends in part on the different funds of knowledge the parent has access to. Toby and Dan's pair process  is more guided and focused than many other participants and includes accessing professional documentation and exploration of computational thinking concepts.

In the second part of vignette 7, Dan(p) outlines a similar approach to Suzanna(p) in resisting _jumping in_. "I try never to touch the keyboard of who's there. If they are stuck on something I always tell them what to do." This approach is  guided influenced by Dan's experience as a software engineer and volunteer at Coder Dojo (gly).

This example sees Dan(p) shifting the kind of helping role as he progresses through different stages of applying a GDP.

Molly continues to do solo design using the Piskel graphical too. She encounters a design problem. When erasing a part of the design she gets rid of background colour. Molly asks for help from partner but receives misleading advice which does not help her progress.
Molly:  Oh no it’s not done that has it?

Molly calls the name of her child across room with theatrical gesture and loud whisper voice
Molly: “Nadine !”
Molly then makes face, wiggles head and shrugs at parent peer. The other parent laughs.
Nadine arrives to help. -->


<!-- Nadine uses the mouse to select the grey background colour with the colour picker tool, then the pen tool to fill in gaps in the design. She then swaps the active colour back from grey to black by clicking the option to swap foreground and background colours.
Molly - How did you do that so quickly? I’ve got to like, carefully... (makes hand gestures to show a sense of hesitant keyboard use)
Parent peer laughs
Nadine bounces up in place and smiles broadly.
Molly: Thanks
Molly: So am I like back with the black now?
Nadine : Yeah but if you want to delete it just press X (which switches between foreground and background colours) and then do it.
Molly: Oh X. Alright Bubs. Thanks. -->


    <!-- NOTE - this is a secondary examples - where GDPs as a concept are not vital. -->






While the helping pattern of accessing the repetoire of researching and accessing technical documentation is available to all pairs, due to the level of skill and experience involved, other technical processes are developed by most participants and are explored in the next section.

<!-- NOTE - DIVISION OF LABOUR IS IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER TOO - REWRITE BASED ON GDP ONLY CONThTENT -->

<!-- The parent cedes the keyboard and mouse and sometimes swaps chairs to allow child to play test the game created.  -->

<!-- At one point the testing process Suzanna shows frustration as gravity value is very low making any movement very slow with little control. While the child has previously rejected increasing the value, the parent's initial acceptance of this decision is later questioned. The parent who has to do the majority of the testing is more insistent to remove a frustrating part of the testing  process.   -->

<!-- Discussion drawing on more radical attempts to describe the best way to bring young learners into a design practice.

 <!-- While there was no formal organising of groups in phase 2 and 3, the family bonds between parents and children created similar patterns of seeking validation, sharing planning. Although this was more the case for dyads working side-by-side on the same game, similar patterns existed for other configurations. -->

<!-- MORE EXAMPLES  ? -->
<!--
NOTE - check if this fits
Once the code for the new game mechanic has been added, the child is guided to take on challenge of making smaller changes that give rapid feedback.  To aid the process the parent navigates to a particular part of the code for child to alter design. The changes the child makes have a large impact on the end users experience.

### The role of GDP used in emerging technical processes (900)

<!-- tool use, technical processes and specialist language -->
<!-- EDIT DOWN ALREADY COVERED IN CHAP 5? -->

Turning from the division of labour to how GDPs interact with the development of use of technical processes in game making. Example of technical processes can be found in exporting graphical files in Appendix.Molly, in _code patching_ (see glossary for terms in italics) in Appendix 1. Technical processes were sometimes introduced in a basic form through scaffolded activities, supporting documentation or evolved from informal interaction between peers. Even introduced processes evolved, being modified by the community.

Thus while use and propagation of new technical processes were often motivated by a drive to implement or complete a GDPs, the following observations bear in mind that the relationship between GDPs and emergent technical processes is complex and interdependent rather than assuming that GDPs directly facilitate emerging tool use.

The following paragraphs address x, y and z

<!-- For some groups, they were introduced explicitly as a parent explains, facilitates or guides a process or at times technical processes are passed on informally in more casual help interactions as illustrated in the previous example.
 IS THIS ADDRESSED ABOVE - A tautology IN TERMS OF USE OF GDP LANGUAGE AS IT IS PRESENTED IN TOOLS. -to avoid overreach when describing the possible utility of GDPs, -->


<!-- Taking a more focused view of the activity here would be implementing a game design pattern - e.g. adding keys and doors pattern in this case. On the level of action, creating a graphical asset of a key and adding this to the level design. The operation would be the exporting the graphical asset as a suitable file format from graphical design tool and uploading it to the code authoring tool. -->

**Increasing technical fluidity of general computer use and software tools**

<!-- Some examples contain processes that are linked to the language and the concepts and player experience of GDPs, for example the use of GDP language of hazards and rewards (see extract). -->

<!-- Other examples are more secondary where the emerging processes and adoption of language concern more to do with more general digital design,  which are needed due to the process of implementing game features - which are in this case structured via GDPs. -->
<!-- by making a distinction between primary and secondary involvement of GDPS in technical processes. -->
<!-- Thus while the concepts of GDPs are some times useful to explain a technical concepts directly, especially where direct / immediate feedback involving concrete example of experience are relevant, at times the process in more indirect. -->


Whilst pursuing the motivation of seeing their GDP-related change in the game many participants become fluid in certain aspects of general computer use and more specific technical processes involved with software use of game making tools.  

Examples of processes being adopted by participants through the implementation of GDPs including the fluidity of navigation between playing and coding window shown by all younger participants and many adults and the development of keyboard and mouse coordination to facilitate navigation within the code environment and external support resources to facilitate the code patching process.

**GDPs encouraging sharing of technical practices**

In Vignette 5.a, we can see that the process of changing pen colours on the graphical tool is one which the child has been able to translate into a effortless process whereas the parent is still consciously building her competency. Nadine has operationalised the process and it becomes part of the toolset of practices that she can draw on [CITE]. Molly also benefits, the expertise of her child to undertake that process is added to her distributed toolset. However, she is also keen to develop her own competency as indicated by her asking child to explain the process.

References to such emerging technical practices were present in many exchanges during informal playtesting and pair interactions. In the following example a reference to a GDP is used to explain the need for the technical process.  

In Vignette 5.e, after giving feedback on the jump speed Molly's game Ed sharing a process to redundant space at the edges of design sprite characters.

<!--
MOVE TO TECHNICAL IF NOT ALREADY HTERE
Playtesting also helped propogate emerging practices. For example, after testing Mi's game In the example above after comments on the jump speed Ed continues.

   Ed: How much jump speed to you have?
   Ed: Your jump speed is massive.
   Ed gives advice about tidying up the sprite outlines.
   Ed: for people with background like yours You can use the “cramping tool””
   Mark  and Ed then explain – SEE THEIR RECORDING
   So that the background is clearer.

While Ed has only just been introduced to the ability to "cramp". He is happy and able to share this useful tool with Mi. Theme -->

<!-- NOTE - In vignette 4.a.5 -->

    "Ed: for people with background like yours You can use the cramping tool."

Ed leads Molly to his workstation and involves his father Mark in the process. Mark uses an example of a GDP in his explanation of why to undertake that process, to not "set things off when you are close to them".

Thus rather than GDPs helping the graphical cropping process, it provokes Ed to notice and suggest it to Molly, and Mark to evoke it as a reason to undertake cropping.  

**Code Patching as a guided technical process and the use of GDPs to nurture tactical responses to coding errors**

Code patching, the process of copying and pasting fixes into on-going projects, is outlined in Appendix.codepatching. The process of code patching is similar in that the documentation is structured around GDPS, and thus similar aspects of an appropriate organising unit apply.

Code patching is a processes which suits being organised around GDPs aligns with the UMC process.

The patches, and patching process became an important process in documentation. While code was provided, in practice mistakes were still made and additional customisations were made.

**Solving / Debuggging code problems that responses are helped by the high level of context present in the use of GDP as a structural design framework.**

In analysis of journal notes and recorded screens I began to identify different kinds of coding problems that blocked participants from progressing and build proficiency and flexibility in addressing them. Reflections on participant experiences of kinds of errors are explored in Appendix.tech.2. In the appendix I reflect on syntax errors which stopped the game from working entirely, bugs where code changes had no effect on the game and glitches which don't crash the game instead creating an unintended effect.

Glitches merit a summary here as a particularly interesting site of guided participation.

In my reflective notes I propose that glitches are more motivating to correct than other errors.


Aspects of the design, use of a starting template and supporting resources based on code snippets and thus code patching process increased appear to encourage glitch bugs.
See Vignette 1 for an example.

MOVE?
A diversity of strategies in responding to errors evolved as I judged when participants to be receptive to different forms of input. Glitch errors were often embraced as curiosities and as a learning opportunity to understand the related code and associated abstract concepts using a concrete example afforded by the mechanics of the game design pattern.

**Discussion**

This area opens some interesting lines of questioning which are beyond the full remit of this research but are included as promising areas.  

- Question - do more useful / less de-motivating errors result from remixing and game patching?
- Question - what impact does the process of being driven by GDPs have on how users deal with errors?
  - For example does the closely paired code structure and game output help with motivation?
  - How do you develop a more granular sense of the kinds of blocks, errors and how to overcome them.


Thus, mirroring the proposition of UMC and more specifically half baked games theory, in that a incomplete / templated game are motivates initial participation, glitch bugs which move game into a broken  state in regards the targeted GDP may have a similar or even  potential for motivation.
EXPLAIN?



In critique of online tutorials researchers note  few provide common errors[@kim_pedagogical_2017]. This lack of problem solving techniques communicated in online tutorials may addressed through use of GDPs.

The debugging process at times surfaced and allow the exploration of surfacing of computational thinking concepts, a topic explored as part of the next section.

## The role of GDPs in the personal appropriation of concepts and processes (500 - Target 750)

**computational, design and systems concepts**


<!-- While the contextual factors involved in this learning environment did not require alignment with a particular curriculum or external examination, computing, design and systems concepts have the potential to arise as part of the game making process. -->

<!-- In particular, the facilitator has the ability to surface and to explore more abstract concepts present in the concrete application of code that have emerged organically from the participants drives to implement particular patterns.    -->

Following Papert and subsequent research on Microworlds, learning designers can shape what they want learners to encounter and explore [MINDSTORMS?]. In Papert's research, the tartget concepts were  mathematical concepts, for example geometry in Turtle computing. The use of x and y allowed a close study of personal dimensions.

Much research since the popularity of CT, has focused on those aspects, on a personal dimension of learning.

While, this thesis focuses on community aspects in line with my own interests, There are significant possibilities to alter this design to suit more exploration of systems concepts and computational thinking. I have written a chapter which explores these aspects with recommendations for practitioners [@chesterman_game_2023], a summary of which and an additional commentary follows.



One of my tensions explored in chapter 5 and explored in Appendix.designnarrative2 was between a motivation to align the learning experience of making games to computational thinking.  

I also noted my own caution about overloading learners with shifting and competing goals. My concern hinged on the potential disorientation of the learner that imposed shifts of focus may provoke. As learners shift between different stages of creation the object of their activity shifts from the larger goal of making an engaging game to a narrower goal of implementing a game design pattern to narrower still of completing one of several actions to complete the implementation of a GDP.


Facilitators can use a prepared collection of GDPs to facilitate participants to surface chosen computational, design and systems concepts embedded in games. The use of a map of learning dimension in the studies design was examined in relation to contextual tensions relating to the motivations surrounding of curriculum concepts.

Table 1.1. Learning Dimensions of the 3M Game Making Model


While there is a lot of potential, building testable progress in  CT and other personal dimensions are not explored significantly in this study, but are explored extensively in other research as explored in the literature review.

This can help justify activities in formal contexts as per Bevan and Petrich's work on tinkering. However, in this learning context the motivations of the learners both children and adults differ from  formal schooling setting and its requirements of teaching to a curriculum and potential exam content. Thus as there was no external imposition, and no organic desire to explore more abstract concepts.

<!-- , I could trust my instincts as a facilitator to not detract attention from participants following an organic and flexible pattern of implementation, self-testing, improvement and playtesting. -->


<!-- In the language of activity theory the change of objective denotes is a shift in scope of the activity system. -->


**Participants appropriate such concepts and feed them back into the community.**

This dimension is not fully explored in the thesis which has a greater focus on community and social aspects of use of GDPs.

However, following Rogoff's interpretation the personal appropriation of concepts is demonstrated in community activity through evolving peer practices. As one-to-one instruction from facilitators was limited which encouraged the community to teach each other.

The process of reusing and modify code to create a computer game can surface both abstract and concrete computing concepts present in the concrete application of code that have emerged organically at different stages of the creative process.
The repeated, solo, incremental changes of the details of implementation of game design patterns indicate a personal appropriation of concepts like game feel and challenge and broad concepts of CT based on Resnick and Brennan's framework.

The following section outlines some examples:  

EXAMPLE/S:

BRIEF EXAMPLES FROM DATA FOLLOW



<!-- Here learner agency is transformative not only of personal dimensions of learning but also the cultural setting, practices and tools available to learners. The process of playtesting other games allowed participants to share their on emerging interpretations of game making concepts like game feel and challenge without being directly taught. Further, the community sense of what is appropriate of fun evolves as mutually and therefore cannot be taught explicitly. -->

<!-- Even, taking Wing's more abstract definition of CT, many examples arise in recorded interactions without being explicitly taught.

_Decomposition_: example of parents helping children break a larger problems into more manageable steps e.g one parent suggests to his child "Save that for version 1.1".  
_Generalisation / pattern recognition_ is present in the majority of participants as patterns are readily available to participants in starting code and the extra patches that are added. The process is repeated.
_Sequencing / algorithms_ are frequently explored in the resolution of errors with participants. In one interaction with Sh, exploring how a bracket placed in the wrong place can effectively break the game yielded a productive discussion on the importance of correct code sequencing (PERHAPS INCLUDE AS APPENDIX?). _Abstraction_, identified by Wing as the most vital CT concept, merits a deeper examination and is covered in a later section of this chapter. -->

<!-- Beyond this broad mapping of systems and computing concepts to aid facilitators to highlight I also sketched out metacognitive activities to explore these concepts on completion of each GDP. As explored in the design chapter, later revisions of the design of supporting materials for each GDP included links to online descriptions of design, systems and computational concepts. Thus, beginning with experience and progressing to analysis in a sway that mirrors reflective professional practice. However analysis of my journal entries show an ongoing reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge. -->

<!-- My intuitive reluctance to impose shifts in the scope of activity systems, can be interpreted through the lens of TADS. For me to prompt a shift to a  activities to reinforce recognitions and connection of learner generated code to computing and systems concepts, would impose a objective (first stimulus) and expose a new set of secondary stimuli for learners to draw on.
THIS SECTION NEEDS DEVELOPMENT AND COMPLEXIFICATION IN RELATION TO EXISTING RESEARCH. -->

## Discussion

The majority of this chapter has focused on interpretation of observations of participant use of GDPS as a mediational strategy / repertoire.

In this discussion section, I:

- explore the uses of GDPs in relation to varied conceptions of abstraction, chiefly CHAT and CT

- propose that GDPs provide a suitable way to engage with coding practices partly due to their position between abstract computational concepts and concrete implementations of code structures.

- explore potential implications for facilitators and researchers on use of GDP collection as an  intermediate pedagogical construct.



### Discussion of findings in relation to CHAT conceptions of abstraction

"While observation and categorization are actions at the root of empirical abstraction, practical transformation, change, and experimentation are actions at the root of theoretical abstraction" [@sannino_activity_2011].

<!-- There are two types of abstractions: empirical and theoretical. Empirical abstraction
is a classification of superficial features of phenomena. Theoretical abstraction refers to the identification of the genetic origins of phenomena that may externally be not alike at all. A theoretical abstraction is based on a functional relationship, also called a germ cell.  While observation and categorization are actions at the root of empirical abstraction, practical transformation, change, and experimentation are actions at the root of theoretical abstraction. Theoretical abstraction allows one to generate and project complex, theoretically mastered concrete manifestations and developmental forms of the reality under scrutiny
Title: Activity theory as an activist and interventionist theory, Author: Sannino, Date: 10/2011 -->

<!-- A deeper exploration of other concepts may suit another chapter looking at synthesing observations in relation to broader research.  -->


In this research, the empirical level of analysis outlines the listing of features which can be added to game, and categorisation into groups based around MDA framework. Moving beyond this empirical categorisation towards a theoretical aspect, the germ cell of the Gameplay Design Pattern becomes more theoretical and generalisable in the varied uses as meditational strategies and as integrated into varied forms of creative cultural and interpersonal repertoires. It is this movement from a kernel idea into varied concrete instances that is the root of the power of the approach according to CHAT scholars.

As to way it is useful.
From the perspective of participants and facilitators, the process can be transferred to other design projects

While understanding the process is more obviously useful for faciliators - it may be helpful to participants as well as they build familiarity with frameworks of features of multimedia projects.


### Discussion of findings in relation to Computational Thinking and  abstraction

I propose design patterns as a more relatable abstract framework than more abstract interpretations of computational thinking following Wing.

#### Design patterns as a intermediate-level, pedagogical framework

<!-- NOTE - PARTS OF THIS WERE MOVED TO THE LIT REVIEW. -->

In chapter two I described the characteristic and limits of computational thinking as a pedagogical framework, specifically concepts include: varied interpretations; the role of levels of abstraction for teachers and learners; and the value of epistemological pluralism as a way to value concrete approaches.

RESTRUCTURE FOLLOWING TO SUPPORT THIS STATEMENT.
The evidence and examples surfaced in this paragraph support a claim that GDPs, as an intermediate-level organisation framework between abstract and concrete coding concepts.  


---

DROP THIS PARAGRAPH? OR COMPRESS AND TACK ON TO LAST ONE?
This conception of levels abstraction can be applied in this learning design to the different scopes game making activity systems. Through this lens the most abstract activity system is the larger one who's objective, to make an engaging game that tells an environmental story, aligns with the problem level of LOA. The level between abstract and concrete is that of choosing, implementing and testing game design patterns, which aligns with design. The most concrete in this interpretation is then the implementation of different lines of code or creation and migration of digital assets.

<!-- As explored in the design chapter, later revisions of the design of supporting materials for each GDP included links to online descriptions of design, systems and computational concepts. Thus, beginning with experience and progressing to analysis in a sway that mirrors reflective professional practice. However analysis of my journal entries show  -->

<!--
SHIFT LATER?

As previously explored I had a reluctance to shift learners away from the practical implementation of repeated game design patterns to focus on more abstract, de-contextualised conceptions of the knowledge. My concern hinged on the potential disorientation of imposed shifts of focus between different stages of creation the object of their activity shifts from the larger goal of making an engaging game to a narrower goal of implementing a game design pattern and the technical actions and operations needed to complete it. -->



RECAP OTHER WORK ON GDP AND THEIR USES - REINTERPRETE IT VIA AT CONCEPTS - MEDIATION

In professional coding environment and training programmes design patterns are seen as a middle ground between abstract CT concepts and more concrete techniques. In chapter two I outlined the work of Eriksson and colleagues using gameplay design patterns with young people [-@eriksson_using_2019] which drew inspiration from the value of design patterns as a form of "intermediate-level concept" as advocated by fellow researchers as a way of sharing results of research [@barendregt_intermediate-level_2018]. In addition, when choosing design patterns, choosing a suitable the level of abstraction is recommended.  

    In order to be useful, patterns must present an abstraction of good practice at a meaningful level of granularity. Formulations that are too abstract will be impractical in real design use; those that are too specific will be difficult to re-use in new scenarios.[@dearden_pattern_2006, p. 20]

Similarly, here the implementation of GDPs as a key unit of activity and analysis for this study, the justification being that it was at this level that richest use and development of tools and processes by the emerging community took place.

#### Concrete and relatable levels of abstraction - linking this communities experiences with existing literature

The process of identifying and working with GDPs in this research process can be mapped as a dialectical process of moving (rising) to the concrete [@sannino_activity_2011].

In this study, experience of the features and behaviour of game are concrete. The concept of design pattern that can be applied to more than one game is more abstract. And more abstract still are computing concepts like abstraction and pattern recognition which are present in the game code and problem solving processes.

MOVE LATER WORK ON MDA HERE
IS THIS REALLY CULTURAL ? - IF SO HOW - OR CHANGE THE FRAMING
Linking to wider cultural activity beyond this learning intervention, the analysis of this chapter highlights dimension of the use of GDPs on a cultural level that also exist in formal analysis of game design frameworks [Salen, and MDA].
I propose that the link between the MDA framework and main areas of GDPs can be used to deepen a possibily profitable connection to professional practices?

The varied use of the collection and individuals gameplay patterns and concepts, can be examined using the lenses of the MDA framework.  
- Home knowledge of mechanics drove many of the requests for GDPs from popular medium of retro games  
- The norming practices often focus on the game feel, which relates most directly to the dynamics lens.  
- Aesthetics and the end user experience motivated some users greatly, while it is not clear if this game code changes in this dimensions fully constitute a gameplay design pattern, they are an important inclusive element of the design.



TO ADD - The MDA framework , and related work on game design frameworks bring a focus to levels of abstraction. The utility LOA is promoted by Waite and Sentence in a focus of computing education [INSERT HOW AND WHY]. While, I chose not to explore this explicitly in my teaching, one potential avenue to explore is the question, is the design helping participants to make their concrete knowledge potentially transferable to other problems?

Around this abstract different behaviour patterns form
And the concept can be embodied on design artefacts
And can be observed an designed for.



#### Synthesis between intermediate and empirical/theoretical perspectives.

Previously abstract concepts or processes become concrete through familiarisation via direct use and indirect observations through community participation. In many of the outlined uses of GDPs in chapter we can see processes at play that help bridge shifts in design perspective (MDA here?).

Both the GDPs and the sub-actions of the wider activity design become short-cuts which stand in for previously tricky to complete set of actions. Rather than promising the transfer abstract concepts to other domains, we see learners build competency in participation in replicable processes. These processes which aid future iterations of the GDP implementation design cycle. The process of operationalisation of these sets of actions contributes to the creation of an informal, complex networked resource of operations which complement the more visible curated catalogue of GDPs.

Game design patterns or their fragments are used as a form of design short cuts. Examples from the above include, _get an enemy in_ , _animate player_ or _get it in the game_ (when referring to transferring an graphical asset from authoring tool to the coding environment). The advantages of such shortcuts are, as discussed, to help with the prioritisation and ideation processes, to facilitate peer propagation of ideas, and potentially to inform debugging and improvements to increase game playability.

IS THIS THE RIGHT PLACE?
There are challenges of the use of these short cuts and at a more general the design choice to lead with a menu of intermediate-level constructs in the form of a menu of GDPs. There may be confusion over use of terms to new comers and these GPD related terms may hide more complex patterns within the name. For example, the shortcuts in Mark and Ed's interaction hides a large amount of problems solving which seems "overwhelming". GDPs can limit the ideation process through an accelerated approach. Also as the menus themselves are not all used by students, and while GDPs do propagate from student to student, which risk further constraints on the process of asking questions about user experience and exploring ideas before committing to implementation.


### A discussion of aspects of culture, home interests and evolving participation in an idioculture

HOWE TO MAKE A LINK?

Turning to another aspect of concrete / relatable experience.

The link to home interests and funds of knowledge is demonstrated in varied ways which enrich the development of a community idioculture which is inclusive and productive in terms of the practicalities of learning how to make games.

The work of Rogoff and Wegner and Lave has guided the surfacing activity in the  such as legitimate peripheral participation, community norming and taking on roles of specialism. More recent work by guitierez describes this as development of repetoires.

At times, activity crosses between cultural and pair guided processes  - DEVELOP HOW
- the role of playtesting as a medium for cultural exchange and a ground in which culture grows in of note
- individual requests and implementations can spread via playtesting
- the immediacy of designing for other is used by parents or children to norm behaviour in inter-personal interactions.  

Recalling that cite one of the challenges of learning coding

The cultural aspects of the learning community are further explored in Chapter 7.
Is there something that merits mentioning here as a link within Ch.7?


### Implications and beginnings of suggestions for practitioners to support inclusive pedagogical approach -

While beyond the remit of this thesis, elements of FoK and FoI, x and y,  align with inclusive processes and ethos behind PBL and UMC.

The observations of this chapter show the advantages of GDP as an intermediate, empirical design framework, occupying a the space between too concrete to be repeated and too theoretical to be grasped by novice game makers.

GDPs create a tangible link between concrete player experience and the affordances of a guided creative process. Learners use of GDP as relatable and flexible constructs that facilitate communication, sustaining engagement, planning and division of labour.

The creation of designed objects using GDPS aid the personal appropriation and the propagation of technical and social processes game making practices.  



<!-- NOTE -  REFRAMING WITH A FOCUS ON AGENCY - IDEALLY THE LATER -->
<!-- Using a choice of patterns when compared to instructional tutorials (previously explored in methods chapter)  -->

<!-- For exa In the language of double stimulation, a tension of relative inactivity at times is overcome by invitations to playtest and resulting interaction. -->

<!-- ### Link Paragraph to next chapter

A theme to follow up in the Maps / personal learning chapter is that of picking up on some of the behaviour of participants, especially that of experienced parents, experience either in coding practices of supporting their children. Once identified, how could beneficial interactions be encouraged in the next iteration of design.

Examples include;
- supporting reflection on design and coding concepts / skills.
- navigation / organisational support - use of a physical map.

For example, the use of CT concepts in a framework, listed as part of the initial design pattern card, which could then be discussed, ticked off or otherwise reflected on. -->

<!-- #### Re-examining the problem of PBL approaches considering the role of the potential of GDP collections -->

**The concept of a restricted activity helps us understand the value a GDP collection for participants**
&  **Design Pattern collections can help structure a learning design into an inclusive pedagogy**

The process of creating a learning design where students were able to choose from a curated set of game design patterns, evolved from open approach in P1 and can be seen as a form of restricting possible activity. The positive impact of restricted choice of activities are outlined in varied educational concepts including Bruner's reducing degrees of freedom [@wood_role_1976]. In the 3M design the process of offering a choice of games patterns emerged to counter a previous open design process of which many learners found too challenging. The patterns emerged chiefly in response to requests from learners and partly from facilitator decision making which broadly matched the criteria of the other study. However, in Eriksson's study the authors selected from an extensive, pre-existing pattern collections [@bjork_patterns_2005].

The processes described above align with PBL and UDL in a way that merits further investigation in different settings.

As explored in the literature review a key challenge to project based learning is finding appropriate conceptual and practical frameworks to scaffold domain specific working practices [@barron_doing_1998]. Different types of scaffolding are available to support PBL and the authors highlight a dialectical tension between engagement via tinkering and pushing "principled understanding" [@barron_doing_1998, p.63].

Design patterns have been explored as a form of scaffolding [@ertmer_scaffolding_2019] for project based learning experiences. Research on design online experiences shows value in interrelated scenarios, features and underlying patterns and principles [@mor_assessing_2014; @kali_collaborative_2006].

In computing eduction pattern based instruction has benefits of making complex problems more modular and concrete [@muller_almost_2004-1; @waite_teaching_2021].

In its engagement with participant choice over which patterns to implement, and varied approaches to making facilitated by varied uses of GDPs, this chapter has begun a process of exploration of the nature and evolution of agency in the practices of the participants, which is continued in the next chapter.

<!-- NOTE - Lots of work on pedagogy of e learning done - but now seems quite dated? How did it stand up to time?  -->


#### Returning to some of the tensions explore in the last chapter.

#### Tensions between facilitating agency and norming practices - REWRITE AS A WAY OF OPENING THIS TOPIC AND CLOSING OFF GDPS

<!-- Participants are able to use the affordances of the existing learning design and add their own evolving practice to them as a way of expressing and building agency. -->


This chapter has outlined the evolving use of GDPs as a meditational strategy to develop coding repertoires that are often shared.  While the development of agency has not been the primary focus of this chapter, this processes can be directly linked to Sannino conception of transformative agency through double stimulation (TADS).

IS THIS A TENSION WORTH HIGHLIGHTING MORE CLEARLY?
However, as a seeming counterpoint to this growing agency is the norming effects of concepts that gain community currency in playtesting. The repeated attempts by participants to make the jumping mechanic of Molly less frustrating can be seen as a potential drag on the agency or autonomy of Molly as a designer. However this may be a false dichotomy. Such norming practices can be seen from a different perspective. IS THIS EXPLORED IN THE NEXT CHAPTER?
The following chapter begins with a deeper exploration of learner agency in relation to existing research in this domain.

<!-- Examples of this dynamic agency include the use of graphical code structures, asking for peer or facilitator support etc. -->
<!-- While the process of direction may be less totally learner-driven approach than the first iteration of the learning design P1, working with a starting menu of game patterns with support still provides challenges to learners and complexity of working processes. Design blockages still occur, and participants have to work with facilitators in depth to overcome issues. There is the possibility to adapt existing patterns, to add new patterns from outside the curated collection or to shift to new game paradigm requiring a different set of patterns altogether. -->

The following table outlines the principle different uses of GDP in the data analysed. The next to last column lists example behaviour and notes vignettes or appendieces where the behaviour can be found in situ with more detailed analysis. The final column indicates how many of the 12 in-depth session transcriptions the behaviour was found within.

It is important to recall the purpose and limitation of these figures outlined in Chapter 4, that this is not designed to claim efficacy of the learning design or to be representative of an average participant (which would require follow up studies of different design).

## Chapter Conclusion

### Summary of the uses of Game Design Patterns

GDPs served both researchers and participants by _providing a common language_ to clarify first learner expression and researcher's analysis of gameplay experience. Gdps functioned as an _inspirational structured design tool_ Eriksson's study outlines the utility notes teacher observations that GDPs served to stimulate learner imagination and ideation stages. The use of a patterns and their collection as a form _intermediate-level knowledge_ by both researchers and participants is under-explored in this study but builds on related work by two of the authors and is explored in the next part of this chapter.

**GDPs can be used as meditational strategies within the AT framework and thus conceptual understanding of participant agency**

CHAT frames diverse use of shared resources and concepts, in this case GDPs, as meditational strategies which can involved into repertoires of practice [@lecusay_telementoring_2015] & guitierez?.  

<!-- THIS PERHAPS IS FOR CONCLUSION? This can be understood in relation to relevant socio cultural theory in the following way, affordences, mutual tool development, FoI, etc. -->

We can frame how these process contribute to the development of agency on the part of participants in the following way.


These concepts and this framing is explore in the next chapter with examples that extend beyond the use of GDPs to other cultural processes.

### Transition to next chapter

This chapter focused on GDPs which while mostly interpersonal, guided participation also touched on emerging cultural elements of the learning community.

While limited in this respect, data indicated the positive impact on participants in implementation of GDPs?

 This is shown particularly in a growing sense of mastery towards technical processes becoming second nature and the resulting ability to share them with family and other peer groups. This complements previous observations on the development and nature of agency in this learning design.  The next chapter explores cultural aspects in greater detail continuing to explore emergent agency in this design by primarily focusing on a drama process as a lens for analysis.




<!-- An alternative take [@perrenet_exploring_nodate-1] looks at abstraction as...
"Abstraction level as a reflection of the so-called processobject duality" -->
<!-- LINK
The process of abstraction is present in a tacit way in the process of actions becoming operations. -->


<!-- In addition, the use of code playground abstracts away complexities of a development environment, and the immediacy of feedback facilitates  fluid and rapid interchange between the code view and resulting web output. -->
<!--
See notes here
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1my3iDjivq64gdcXsmwqKVP0QJMDvfBN3MsD0FoeI4Qs/edit -->

<!-- In this context of novice coders in an informal environment it seems appropriate to introduce some levels of reusable practice whilst initially prioritising individual learner engagement and community participation. -->
<!-- Game design patterns contain elements of more abstract and thus repeatable structures thus fulfilling some of the promise transfer offered by advocates of Computational Thinking. This is explored in more depth in the next chapter. -->


<!-- ### Use of GDP as communication short cuts (SYNTHESIS)
 **Discussing Game design patterns as a tool to expose and give participants a language to discuss and resolve tensions (Practitioner focus)**

 This section;
 - synthesises examples which highlight the value of developing share language and short cuts
 - explores possible drawbacks
 - looks at restricted

 Examples of short cuts include, "get an enemy in", animate player from Ed and Ma's exerpts.

 The advantages of such shortcuts are, as discussed to help with the prioritisation and ideation processes, to facilitate peer propagation of ideas, and potentially to inform debugging and improvements to increase game playability.

 However, there are challenges of the use of such short cuts including;
 - hiding more complex patterns within the name.
 - confusion over use of terms to new comers

 For example the shortcut of a name for a pattern in Ed and Ma's interaction hides a large amount of problems solving which seems "overwhelming" -->

<!-- ### Call back to design practices
As per last chapter but develop in relation to GDPs -->
<!-- However from the novice designers' perspective, there are elements of patterns involved. -->
<!--
**Exploring the grokkable nature of GDPs**

 GDPs if well designed can be accessible in this grokkable way.
The term grok is used here to indicate an embodied, intuitive understanding that mirrors the concept of deep learning. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok

Repeated practice is an important part of this process.
Other examples of grokking concepts? -->

## MOVED FROM INTRODUCTION


<!-- In interpreting the results of this chapter it is of value to explore experiences of participant agency in a way which reflects the mutual development of this design. Thus the intersection of the participant agency and use of GDPs both as introduced and adopted processes will be examined in this chapter. -->

<!-- MOVE TO PERSONAL However, despite the value of a micro approach which includes close analysis of implementation of code structures. -->

<!-- The focus on GDP as unit of analysis is supported in the following observations;

- the frequency of GDP language referring to patterns used by pairs in particular in the process of collaborating on their games
- Through observation of GDPs as a germ-cell being used at different phases / scope of the learning design as it evolved.
-->

<!-- The previous chapter explores how I developed these requests into a set of code examples, instruction tutorials, quick start activities which proposed micro level code modification. While these approaches are  distinct in their pedagogical use, they stemmed from the same germ-cell activity of altering the game through transforming GDPs. -->


<!-- In addition the following aspects of the use of GDPs merit attention in this chapter:

NOTE CHECK THESE WITH THE DISCUSSION CONCLUSION.

- the value of completing something concrete a sense of sustaining achievement.

<!-- #### On GDPs as a concept to help analysis -->
<!-- MOVE TO METHODOLOGY - JUST GET ON WITH IT?
Blunden cites the process of identifying a germ cell of activity as a fruitful process for researchers [FIND]. In addition, Engestrom frames expansive learning as instructive for organisational change. While research is more sparse in the field of educational practice, the principles are frequently applied to classroom practice. -->
<!-- My decision to privilege the implementation of each GDP as the main objective  activity system mirrors choices by other researchers valuing  -->

<!-- CHECK AGAINST METHODOLOGY
tie in conceptts of
- leading activity
- repeated activity / iteration
- rising to the concrete - ie different forms of activity.  -->


<!-- MOVED EARLIER HERE - Check it fits? In the literature review and methodology chapter we examined different interpretations of agency used by researchers using activity theory [@hopwood_agency_2022].  -->

<!-- DROP? We can ask where does knowledge of GDPs in participant come from. Good games communicate their affordances, (in the form of GDPs) to the player without the need for extensive additional documentation [@gee_learning_2005]. This process also communicates GDPs implicitly to players, a process borne out by brainstorming sessions early in the process which say participants listing GDPs or variants of them without explicit guidance in this direction. This  goal setting and implementation using GDP as a base developed into a principle activity of P1 with varied results. -->

<!-- In addition to support their identification of the different elements that make up a game I created a sheet which drew on existing work framework (mechanics, space, goals, etc) to scaffold the process. -->

<!-- This study activity covers a wide spectrum of activity, in other chapters,  design stages involving discussion, planning, implementation and playtesting after each new game element. -->
<!-- THERE IS OVERLAP HERE WITH THE LAST CHAPTER - HOW TO REMOVE THAT AND RETAIN CLARITY ?

Thus in this study activity covers a full spectrum including close analysis of implementation of code structures. However these smaller operations are not worthy of being treated as an activity system in full. WHY MAKE THIS POINT. wHAT IS THE OVERALL MOTIVATION HERE?  -->

<!--
#### On GDPs as a germ concept to help practical development -->

<!-- NOTE - removed -  what is the germ cell of the overall game making activity. -->

<!-- around, game mechanics, game space, game polish and game challenges. -->

<!-- LATER?

AT provides a concept of rising to the concrete which invites analysis of how the construct of  GDPs can be be adapted to serve the development of a game making community at different scopes of activity. To illustrate this concept we can use Marx's concept of exchange as a germ-cell for analysis of capitalism.  -->
<!-- The previous chapter described the  key elements of the learning design that were in place by P2 ( remixing from a game template, use of distributed asset creation showcasing and social playtesting).  The shared tools and documentations began to shape goal setting around implementing new features, some where held in common with other groups. -->

### MOVED FROM GUIDED PARTICIPATION

<!-- Patterns and the multiple actions and operations they entail are referred to briefly using short cut names.   -->


<!-- Discussion later or before??? Maps -
GDP are already being used as a way to set goals, track progress and prioritise but the process seems stressful or unsatisfactory. Some kind of support help scaffold this process would be potentially productive. Changes to the emerging 3M design to provide such support are explored in the following chapter. -->


<!--
We can compare this drawn out process with a more rapid prioritisation guided by a parent with more experience in software development. Toby and Dave  are discussing possible features early in the process if ideation.

They thinking of a feature – wrap around like Pac-man
Dave  – Yeah we can do that. Save that for version 1.1
-->

<!-- This pattern completion is mirrored in the work of other pairs. Thus replicating is a kind of participation in an emerging community.
There is also a link made by the parent to previous working practices. Using a paper book to make a sketch of the work to be completed. -->
<!-- These kinds of shifts of activity and cultural practices brought by the participants also feed into the ongoing culture of the game making community. For example the use of paper designs and paper prototyping that for some of the home ed families was a familiar practice was something that I adopted more broadly after observing the families involved. -->
