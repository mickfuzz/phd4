<!-- This thesis explores how computing game design and programming (CGD&P) can be made more inclusive and responsive to the needs of late primary-aged learners. Drawing on sociocultural theory, activity theory, and design-based research, the study investigates how pedagogy can support learner agency, surface contradictions, and connect with childrenâ€™s existing repertoires of knowledge and interest.

The research was conducted across five phases in a UK home education context, involving a diverse group of children, parents, and facilitators. A flexible pedagogical model, called the 3M framework (Missions, Maps, and Methods), was developed and refined through cycles of co-design and facilitation. It made use of curated game design patterns, playful narrative structures, and adaptable code templates to support creative and collaborative learning.

Using video analysis, screen capture, and contradiction mapping, the study examined how learners engaged with technical, cultural, and relational aspects of game-making. Findings show how participants adapted tools, resisted fixed roles, and developed new forms of agency through playful experimentation and collective problem-solving.

The thesis contributes to educational theory by extending activity-theoretical approaches to agency in informal computing settings and offers practical insights for educators seeking to design more inclusive, dialogic, and creative programming experiences. -->
