## Mick Chesterman Profile - 100 words

Mick Chesterman teaches at the Manchester Metropolitan on education project-based units. His PhD studies involve families exploring cultural and ecological issues of coding platform games together. He has a history of teaching media making to facilitate positive change for social groups. In recent years he has run several outreach programs in local communities and schools linked to the University. These workshops have a focus on creative coding and the use of physical materials. He is the founder of Todmorden Makery which works with adults, young people and families to repair objects and transform old technology into educational projects.

## Abstract 100 Words

This presentation addresses digital game making as an inclusive process to develop coding concepts and coding fluency. It outlines research which emerges from my work with young learners of ages 8-12 which leverages the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities and adapts them to more structured educational environments. I summarise the features of two game making tools used in my study. I give an overview of a novel game making pedagogy, named 3M, and share links to extensive resources for learners and teachers.
