title: Application for TEPA 2024 - Mick Chesterman
---


## Mick Chesterman Profile - 100 words

Mick Chesterman teaches at the Manchester Metropolitan on education project-based units. His PhD studies involve families exploring cultural and ecological issues of coding platform games together. He has a history of teaching media making to facilitate positive change for social groups. In recent years he has run several outreach programs in local communities and schools linked to the University. These workshops have a focus on creative coding and the use of physical materials. He is the founder of Todmorden Makery which works with adults, young people and families to repair objects and transform old technology into educational projects.

## Abstract 100 Words

This presentation addresses digital game making as an inclusive process to develop coding concepts and coding fluency. It outlines research which emerges from my work with young learners of ages 8-12 which leverages the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities and adapts them to more structured educational environments. I summarise the features of two game making tools used in my study. I give an overview of a novel game making pedagogy, named 3M, and share links to extensive resources for learners and teachers.

## Blog post Intro

The overall thrust of this blog post that game making as a computing pedagogy remains fertile ground to develop students confidence and fluency but that need further development and sharing of practice are needed to overcome systemic barriers to achieving that potential.   

My research with home educating families developed a game making pedagogy which has been shaped by and integrates patterns of home behaviours and inherent design patterns present in retro games platform games.  

## Contextual information including school based barriers

Before attending the TEPA conference in summer 2024. I was beginning to be sceptical that my hope of integrating some of the findings and pedagogies back into a school or more formal environments would come to anything. This concern based on my own experience of teacher training for computing in secondary level, stemmed from the difficulties of completing project work in the context of computing qualifications.  

These concerns were validated by discussions happening at TEPA, in particular a panel discussion called, which outlined some of the background of the last minute reconfiguration of the computing qualifications guidelines which focused on more abstract knowledge rather than encouraging more hands on, creative digital projects.

Even the hands on programming projects which formed a part of the GSCE exam, latter dropped due to plagiarism concerns, were narrowly prescribed and allowed little creativity of incorporation of home interests of students. It is now possible to sit and pass a computing GSCE without ever touching a computer. I talked to one of my child's friends this week, an artistic year 8. She said she missed the creative multi-media and game projects she was able to undertake using Scratch in year 7. What do you do now, I said. She replied "write down definitions of routers". This is sad on a personal level and also represents a failure to prepare this student for the future.

At the conference, while there was acknowledgement that good teachers do find ways to bring in creative project work, they do so despite, rather than because of the and other systemic pressures on the at school (timetabling and resources available). Drawing on the data from Kemp which shows the increasing failure to attract a diversity of students to undertake Computing at GSCE, there seemed to be a consensus that it was time for an increasing push back to change the qualifications and wider rhetoric around computing and I.T education to bring back digital creativity. I left feeling more optimistic, for the wider application of my research requires a context which allows a project-based approach. Thus if the situation does change then the game making pedagogy which emerged from my doctoral will be more widely applicable.

## Summarising my results

### Situating game making

The benefits of game making as a process have been well outlined in a book and accompanying papers by Kafai and Burke. To do this they draw on a constructionist tradition which includes the work of Papert on LOGO language and the use of drawing robots, and that of   Resnick on block based programing  languages. While the work on the diverse benefits of game making is convincing, the review is more patchy on how to create specific pedagogies which draw on the importance of social and cultural learning. Other reviews and commentaries conclude that more work is needed in this area. Thus my research aims to contribute to this area using cultural historical activity theory to examine these areas more systematically.

I adopted an approach which aligns with the increasing convergence of activity theory interventions with design based research [@penuel_emerging_2014] to collaboratively create a game making pedagogy drawing on the experience and working patterns of families, mostly in parent-child pairings. Over four iteration of research a pedagogy and set of tools emerged which I present as ready for further testing in different situations.  

Mention agency?

### Describing the characteristics  of the 3M game making pedagogy

In early dissemination of research I outlined the characteristics of the pedagogy as a 3M framework incorporating missions, methods, and maps. The maps aspect was highlighted to help adapt the process for teacher looking to align skills learned in game making with curricular concerns and concepts. A chapter outlines this approach [@chesterman ]

The main challenge of the research and process evolved to chart the development of fluency in the game making and coding process using a _mission_ based approach and the incorporation of home interests through the use of inclusive pedagogical _methods_ . Given the limited space of this blog post I'll concentrate on those aspects here.



### Missions

The term missions became a playful way to represent two key emerging aspects of pedagogy, firstly the application of short term coding and asset production goals by participants and secondly social side missions which reinforced working patterns.

**Main Missions**

For participants their need to and requests to add new features to their game spurred me to research and produce support materials to aid this.

After several iterations of the game making programme the end result was a online menu or collection of
resources to support themed by the type of game design pattern. This categorisation drew on existing work on game design patterns by Schnell and Salen. 



While some learners took to the resources created to carefully implement their chosen patterns, others approached game making in different ways. I began to notices these behaviours and sought to encourage them.

**Playful  Missions**

The vehicle to encourage these diverse approaches sprang from a conversation with a colleague interested in playful learning, John Lean, about Bartle's game playing styles, Briefly, this research explored diverse motivations and styles of game play on digital adventure games.

MORE ON THIS

This means of drawing on home styles of interaction, in a way that [@gutierrez2020utopian] would refer to as incorporation of home and play repetoires of practice, spurred me to explore other ways in which funds of identity could be incorporated into the game making process with an aim to increase agency therein.


### Inclusive methods to build participant agency

The term agency here is understood within a socio-cultural perspective as not a personal property but one that exists in context.



### 3M as more than the sum of its parts

In later analysis, the focus widened to address agency and the co-creation of the pedagogy,  

Choice and impact in different dimensions. Relational and authorial agency.
