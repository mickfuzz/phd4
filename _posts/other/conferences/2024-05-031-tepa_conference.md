title: Application for TEPA 2024 - Mick Chesterman
---


## Mick Chesterman Profile - 100 words

Mick Chesterman teaches at the Manchester Metropolitan on education project-based units. His PhD studies involve families exploring cultural and ecological issues of coding platform games together. He has a history of teaching media making to facilitate positive change for social groups. In recent years he has run several outreach programs in local communities and schools linked to the University. These workshops have a focus on creative coding and the use of physical materials. He is the founder of Todmorden Makery which works with adults, young people and families to repair objects and transform old technology into educational projects.

## Abstract 100 Words

This presentation addresses digital game making as an inclusive process to develop coding concepts and coding fluency. It outlines research which emerges from my work with young learners of ages 8-12 which leverages the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities and adapts them to more structured educational environments. I summarise the features of two game making tools used in my study. I give an overview of a novel game making pedagogy, named 3M, and share links to extensive resources for learners and teachers.

## Blog post Intro

The overall direction of this blog post that game making as a computing pedagogy remains fertile ground to develop students confidence and fluency but that need further development and sharing of practice are needed to overcome systemic barriers to achieving that potential.   

My research with home educating families developed a game making pedagogy which has been shaped by and integrates patterns of home behaviours and inherent design patterns present in retro games platform games.  

## Contextual information including school based barriers

Before attending the TEPA conference in summer 2024. I was beginning to be sceptical that my hope of integrating some of the findings and pedagogies back into a school or more formal environments would come to anything. This concern based on my own experience of teacher training for computing in secondary level, stemmed from the difficulties of completing project work in the context of computing qualifications.  

These concerns were validated by discussions happening at TEPA, in particular a panel discussion called, which outlined some of the background of the last minute reconfiguration of the computing qualifications guidelines which focused on more abstract knowledge rather than encouraging more hands on, creative digital projects.

Even the hands on programming projects which formed a part of the GSCE exam, latter dropped due to plagiarism concerns, were narrowly prescribed and allowed little creativity of incorporation of home interests of students. It is now possible to sit and pass a computing GSCE without ever touching a computer. I talked to one of my child's friends this week, an artistic year 8. She said she missed the creative multi-media and game projects she was able to undertake using Scratch in year 7. What do you do now, I said. She replied "write down definitions of routers". This is sad on a personal level and also represents a failure to prepare this student for the future.

At the conference, while there was acknowledgement that good teachers do find ways to bring in creative project work, they do so despite, rather than because of the and other systemic pressures on the at school (timetabling and resources available). Drawing on the data from Kemp which shows the increasing failure to attract a diversity of students to undertake Computing at GSCE, there seemed to be a consensus that it was time for an increasing push back to change the qualifications and wider rhetoric around computing and I.T education to bring back digital creativity. I left feeling more optimistic, for the wider application of my research requires a context which allows a project-based approach. Thus if the situation does change then the game making pedagogy which emerged from my doctoral will be more widely applicable.

## Summarising my results

### Situating game making

The benefits of game making as a process have been well outlined in a book and accompanying papers by Kafai and Burke. To do this they draw on a constructionist tradition which includes the work of Papert on LOGO language and the use of drawing robots, and that of   Resnick on block based programming  languages. While the work on the diverse benefits of game making is convincing, the review is more patchy on how to create specific pedagogies which draw on the importance of social and cultural learning. Other reviews and commentaries conclude that more work is needed in this area. Thus my research aims to contribute to this area using cultural historical activity theory to examine these areas more systematically.

I adopted an approach which aligns with the increasing convergence of activity theory interventions with design based research [@penuel_emerging_2014] to collaboratively create a game making pedagogy drawing on the experience and working patterns of families, mostly in parent-child pairings. I have also been inspired by Stetsenko [@stetsenko_serious_2015] who encourages the researcher to resist artificial objectivist approaches to take a transformative activist stance (TAS) in to build participant of agency through active interventions.

Over four iteration of research interventions in the form of short game making courses, a pedagogy and set of tools emerged which I present as ready for wider testing.  

### Describing the characteristics  of the 3M game making pedagogy

In early dissemination of research I outlined the characteristics of the pedagogy as a 3M framework incorporating missions, methods, and maps. The maps aspect was highlighted to help adapt the process for teacher looking to align skills learned in game making with curricular concerns and concepts. A chapter outlines this approach [@chesterman ]

The main challenge of the research and process evolved to chart the development of fluency in the game making and coding process using a _mission_ based approach and the incorporation of home interests through the use of inclusive pedagogical _methods_ . Given the limited space of this blog post I'll concentrate on those aspects here.

### Missions: leading activities offering both structure and choice

The term missions became a playful way to represent two key emerging aspects of pedagogy, firstly the application of short term coding and asset production goals by participants and secondly social side missions which reinforced working patterns.

**Main Missions (Game Design Patterns)**

For participants their need to and requests to add new features to their game spurred me to research and produce support materials to aid this. To do this I drew upon the educational posibilities of design patterns. While design patterns are most commonly used for computing students at higher education to teach object oriented computing, they are also useful for all levels of learners. Design patterns are rooted in real-life incidences of problems that are often solved in a particular way. They are concrete examples of coding principles in context. Design patterns can help the development of coding communities if more experiences coders take the time to document the patterns they use in an accessible way for novice coders. For educators the use of design patterns can help support learners develop coding proficiency by providing scaffolding and modelling good design decisions. However, one of the challenges for teachers of using worked examples and design patterns is how to integrate them into student-led design challenges.

In the learning design of this research, the process of following the request of participants led me to create resources in the form of code examples and snippets based on the requests for different gameplay design patterns (GDPs). Rather than the more complex, structural form of traditional object-oriented code design pattern, gameplay patterns focus on the end users experience.
I drew on the work on Schnell and Salen to scaffold the creative process of novice game makers through a categorisation on game design patterns. After several iterations of the game making programme the end result was a online menu or collection of resources themed by the type of game design pattern which is available online here.

As well as being an effective pedagogical approach, the implementation of GDPs, in line with activity theory, became the ideal candidate as a unit of activity to anaylse the emerging community processes of game making of participants. While some learners took to the resources created to carefully implement their chosen patterns, others approached game making in different ways. I began to notices these behaviours and sought to encourage them.

<!-- I can remember them being popular and perceived as useful by fellow students when I completed a Computing masters. -->


**Playful Missions (encouraging social repertoires)**

The vehicle to encourage these diverse approaches sprang from a conversation with a colleague interested in playful learning, John Lean, about Bartle's game playing styles, Briefly, this research explored diverse motivations and styles of game play on digital adventure games. I applied the same approach to investigate and reflect back the different game making styles that began to emerge in the community. Some families carefully set goals and followed resources to implement them. Others took more social approaches, learning from others and trading ideas and encouragement. Still others engaged in the process in more tricky ways, creating confusing or unusual games or working against some of the suggested creative practices. A summary of some of the different making styles is included as Fig x.

I became intrigued by these styles and began to reflect back some of my observations. In one iteration, I integrated playful additional (side) missions into the program which legitimised some of the  

Table x examples of playful missions

In one phase of the learning design, with the help of my school's drama department, I incorporated these playful missions into a drama scenario inspired by the Mantle of the Expert process. This means of drawing on home styles of interaction, in a way that Gutierrez  [@gutierrez2020utopian] would refer to as incorporation of home and play repertoires of practice, spurred me to explore other ways in which funds of identity could be incorporated into the game making process with an aim to increase agency therein. I explore these briefly in the final section of this post.


### Methods: Inclusive methods to build participant agency

The term agency here is understood within a socio-cultural perspective as not a personal property but one that exists in context. Building agency in this emerging community of game makers is a process involving individual learners working as part of a community evolving joint working practices and collective applied knowledge and evolving the tools needed.  For reason of space, in the final section of this blog post, rather than deeper analysis of the evolving processes at work, I share some practical recommendations concerning inclusive methods as research recommendations for those looking to support the development of agency in a new community of game makers.

Allow learners to draw on their home interests by creating an inclusive creative environment where they are supported to explore the existing knowledge of game conventions and their attitudes to video game playing.

Start coding with a half-baked game [@kynigos_half], A starting template which all learners adapt from providing a shared structure which promotes peer learning and helps facilitators stay familiar with participants evolving code.  

Use emerging learner requests to shape a collection of code examples and supporting documentation based on recognisable gameplay design patterns. Encourage the use of this collection to provide needed technical support in a way which allows learners to incorporate new features based on their own choices.

Allow flexible working practices and incorporate regular play-testing as a way to encourage learners to be able to draw on existing learning relationships they have with family members and to allow new repertoires of practice with peers to emerge.

Finally, as explored briefly above, incorporate playful approaches to build connections with home play funds of knowledge.


### Concluding remarks

While the application of the research is still at its early stages the recommendations above are framed as imperatives, as I wish to encourage wider testing of these processes to test the generalisability of the findings based on several motivations to further explore these findings.

Firstly the overall approach is aligned with solid foundations of use of funds of identity as an inclusive and transformational practice for young people using digital technology, as explored in a special issue of Mind, Culture and Activity.

Secondly, the process of drawing on games a base for the expression of these funds of identity remains a valid approach, for while research on game making may have waned in terms of the next fashionable thing, its interest from young people endures.  

Thirdly, in light of increased concerns about risky online activity and screen time addiction, family involvement in the digital lives of young people is an ongoing issue. Game making as an joint family activity would appear to offer an accessible and inclusive foundation from which to explore further digital issues impacting on home lives.

Finally, we can hope that the pendulum of digital education on the UK and beyond may swing back from the conservative party's stance on the power of abstracted knowledge, exemplified by the  Michael Gove's implementation of computing curriculum and exam structure, towards a more applied approach following by Papert's visions of computational thinking as based on concrete, hands on computing experiences involving projects which can motivate personal connections to underlying content knowledge in context.
