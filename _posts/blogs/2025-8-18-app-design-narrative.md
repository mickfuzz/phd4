# Additional narrative of tool evolution Phases 1-5

**Getting started**

In D1 the decision to work with retro games stemmed from a Home Education consultation event which is described in Chapter 1. This possibility to work with games spurred a return to my own love of arcade games. I became an enthusiastic pirate, scouring the web for emulated versions of the arcade games I played in the late 1970's and early 1980's. I was intrigued and impressed by the community of enthusiasts sharing these archives of games, translated into ROMs, and shared online, and creating software to emulate the old arcade machines and home video game consoles.  

**Exploratory Phase 1**

<!-- When reviewing my notes on this section I am surprised how the learners managed to keep engaged as I only introduced the actually tools to undertake text coding in week 5 due to my own hesitancy in supporting coding. -->

I only introduced the actually tools to undertake text coding in week 5 due to my own hesitancy in supporting coding. This hesitancy led to exploration of diverse use of tools and processes. I even asked participants to create a mock up of their characters and backgrounds within Scratch as its interface was familiar to some, and more user friendly to others.

I don't know why it took me so long to adapt a template from the community and use it as a base given that I had taken this approach in my previous study detailing accelerated coding using a starter template of an HTML and css based meme [@chesterman_webmaking_2015].

In week 5 I introduced a minimal template to remix from based on a phaser tutorial.  I used this one from Phaser -  and adapted it and presented in the Thimble code playground. As of October 2025 it is still available to view  https://codepen.io/mrmick/pen/jaXzxw?editors=0010.  


**Summary of motivations and sources of P2 template**

Chapter 5 gives a summary of the motivations of the structure of the P2 starting template.
A fuller picture is included here.
THIS IS INCOMPLETE RIGHT NOW.
