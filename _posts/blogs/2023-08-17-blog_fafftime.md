## Value of Faff Time


DROPPED  FAFF TIME

Much time in sessions was spent on activities that did not fit nearly into an accepted design stage, for example: opening software tools; navigating to correct locations; and finding past assets. These processes often  involved significant effort and collaboration between participants. For example the  migrating assets between authoring tools, converting to correct formats, evaluating new tools, and finding previously created assets. These are practices that I am personally familiar with. I call them digital laundry or digital housekeeping. Things that at times can be low attention span. Faff time is even less productive switching on the computer and waiting for the internet to connect, waiting for a family member to finish their rushed lunch or navigating to the right location in creative software.
