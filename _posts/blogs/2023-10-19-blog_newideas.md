## Helping with the Digital Laundry

There were some issues of access for some participants who did not remember or recall log in details or their project name. These issues were mitigated through the use of a log in details shared between participants. When users struggled to log in or to find the games or assets that they had created earlier there sought and received help from family members or other peers. Direct help from facilitators was rarely required.

## Details of code errors

In the glitch environment code errors were highlighted in with red dot in the interface which gave a quick visual indication of where the error occurred, when the user hovered over gave an error message as a pop up, which while limited and sometimes misleading, gave participants immediate feedback on syntax errors. In analysis of video data, I observed learners reacting to this feedback and either reversing errors such as deleting commas, semi-colons and quotations marks. When participants were coding as a pair, especially the parent was observing they would often notice and point out the red dot, thus preventing further errors.  The next chapter explores different types of errors and participant responses to them.
