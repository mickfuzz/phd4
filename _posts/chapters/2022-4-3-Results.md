## Starting thoughts on writing up results.

The 3M model as a pedagogical model which aligns with PBL principles and more general social approach to learning coding.

Could the three aspects - missions (design patterns), maps, and methods form three chapters of results?

The use of tensions and how the model resolves them is a part of RD2. Can this is stay if shift from AT to design based research as a framework.

A start here of mapping in a Matrix that could be included in a concluding chapter.

## Vignette Illustrating Specifics of Game Making Practices

In phases 1-4 the authenticity of the javascript text coding environment was an important priority first learning design. The complexity of the multiple authoring environments led to tensions that the family had to learn to overcome through progress in *digital literacy* and the coding competency when trying to achieve primary game coding goals. These tensions are exemplified in the vignette of S and T, included as an Appendix. An extract of this vignette follows.

In this transcript S is the Parent. T is the Child. M is Mick the Facilitator. For the previous five mins have a shared goal of fixing an error in the software which prevents their wider objective of adding the game space pattern of adding levels to the game however the process has disengaged T. M has just resolved that error in partnership with S who reengages T.\

Comments on Vignette


Dialogue and gestures of the participants indicate that they have established a working pattern where the child directs the direction of design and tests the game play and the adult uses their more advanced digital literacy to drive the code changes and use of software tools at trickier points of the process. When there are points of game making which are within the capability of the child she is able to take over the computer to implement those changes and test the results. Even though this general pattern seems established, this process is not without conflict.

For example, this direction of design is not uncontested in this interaction. The mother is closely monitoring the changes of level design. When the child makes changes that are not clearly purposeful, the mother challenges this *'(Alarmed) What are you doing?'*. The child takes delight in surprising her mother with an unexpected design element. Additionally, after asking her mother to take back control of the keyboard the child also directs her mother to delete many 'h's' (hazards) from the game. When the mother realises the plan is to delete all hazards she protests, *"It's no fun having a game with no hazards"*. The child responds. *"It is for me."*

By this stage of game making, within the existing game design we can see evidence of some of the initial design principles. The makers have adapted starting graphics from simple blocks to incorporate their own interest of a game which encourages cycling and discourages car use. Layout design has been altered extensively. Both are drawing on funds of knowledge to do with their home interests of reducing car use and background knowledge of the conventions of digital games.

In interactions there are moments when due to code affordances designed to be within the capability of novice coders T was able to make changes of level design directly. This was als the case for design of graphical elements. T can be seen to be directly engaged at this time either through direct control of the keyboard, or step by step driving of their parent's activity. The use of the terms of the game pattens, in this case the Key and Door pattern, by T are evidence of a strong connection to the embedded concept of the game pattern and a high level of motivation to enact this being added to the game

However much of this interaction T was disengaged. Once the child had made the next design choice, the hard slog of enacting this change on a code level was down the parent S. S then ran into several barriers when trying to make the change happen. The included; lack of clarity of instructions, the reluctance of S to engage help from the facilitator (seemingly to avoid competing for attention with other groups), and being frustrated at distracting activities from their bored child.

For both participants there is an explicit awareness of game making patterns and concept of the game as a dynamic system. Both seem to drive their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game. Game making patterns are outlined by both the child and parent. They talk of adding more levels, of the mechanic of keys and doors and then progressing to another level. The child takes delight in outlining the *Key Door* pattern of game progression, singing it aloud. The transformation from the period of time when her parent was problem solving code is dramatic. I propose that a contributing factor to this motivation is the ability to replicate a familiar pattern of game play via their own work in construction. It is the ability to translate this home knowledge into their own artefact which gives a sense of mastery over an otherwise foreign environment.

It can be seen that coding difficulties and states of stuck-ness continued in the learning design despite the use of a starting code template and step-by-step help resources. As a facilitator this stuck-ness is frustrating to observe, however clearly challenge must not be designed out of a learning experience. The importance of retaining such stickyness was born out in participant interview data that highlighted moments of overcoming such code block and witnessing the desired behavior manifest on the computer screen as feeling exciting and worth the struggle. However, in this relationship there is a danger that there was a disproportionate amount of time spent undertaking correction of code syntax and other issues of code structure. These errors are beyond the remit of this beginner coders. They are not explicitly taught, and are ideally abstracted from the design, however it be possible to break code structure when altering the existing template.

The result being a reduced amount of time spent on activities such as on enacting new designs conceptual problem solving and other learning outcomes which seemed more unique to the the potential of game making. Through interactions with participants in sessions, I started to develop what felt like a tangible feeling for the amount of effort participants would put into an addition to the game based on the pay off it would provide. This judgement was then translated into choices for which game patterns were written up and suggested in the programme designs for later phases.

Resolving frustrations from coding errors** **

As explored in the commentary on the vignette, a common tension for participants is that of not being able to achieve goals due to coding errors. While the concept of learning from failure is well worn, the demotivating effect of mistakes that appear unpenetrable to solution was both palpable and time consuming to address.

### Code Examples and Step By Step Tutorials

Towards the end of phase 1 I began to create code examples to illustrate of how particular commonly requested game features were implemented. These barebone game projects were hosted on a code playground. An online document in our shared google drive working space linked to these examples. I would help participants access this when they requested a certain feature. This list of game features began to grow. For phase one these code example were not particularly successful at increasing learner independence. There were differences in the code structure of their games and the examples and translation was not intuitive.

In phase 2 I began to write up the implementation of the same game features but more closely integrated with the new starting code template used. Thus these individual tutorials became much directive. The step by step tutorials were available online and also as printed A4 hand outs which were provided on request of the older participants. I have brought the workshops resources together a book published on the FLOSS Manuals documentation platform Chesterman, 2019).

### Embracing Different Types of Errors

In the context surrounding the interaction outlined in the above vignette, the parent had tried valiantly to overcome a conflict caused by incomplete documentation and her own incomplete knowledge of the computational patterns used in the construction of the game's code. A way to start to normalise the experience of overcoming blocks is to get greater granularity on into the detail and types or errors. In the art of war on errors, we must know our enemy. These include:

-   **Syntax and Program Errors** are errors in your code which stop thegame from functioning at all, often resulting in a blank screen. -   ****No **Behaviour Bugs** are errors which in your code which don'tstop the game from functioning but your intended effect is notpresent when it should be. -   **Glitches** don't stop your game from running but as you play you see that there is an unintended effect. The game does something different from what we want it to do.

The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful.

Further analysis of the different kinds of errors that are likely to arrive and testing different strategies for dealing with them that take into account the zone or proximal development of the participants may provide not only useful input for the participants, but also opportunities to check understandings of processes and game patterns and computational patterns in use.

### Guided Code Patching

In response to on-going frustrations of time blockages, where were commonly reflected back by participants, even after step-by-step tutorials were introduced, I added an additional layer of a more systematic structure to the existing resources. Visual aids guided where to cut and paste code patches within their code structure with a greater level of specificity see figure as an example. This addressed a common lack of detailed understanding of the underlying code structure used in the code and the importance to place code extracts in the correct function to maintain the integrity of the syntax.

In making decisions like the one to include extra visual scaffolding in step by step documentations. I am balancing here many different factors of concern in the complex learning environment. These include; authenticity of programming environment and language, use of the existing structure of the phaser library, the learning process of participants getting stuck and having to resolve tensions, my time limits providing individual support as a facilitator of a group, and the patience of participants when they encounter incomplete documentation.

During this process of careful documentation I became concerned that over facilitation in this instructional way would remove the possibility for errors and thus reduce the opportunities for learning from resolving failure. However, while each stage of the process of adding game pattern was documented in as complete a fashion as possible, in practice mistakes were still made and additional customisations were made. Thus while the process did reduce dependency on my input as a facilitator there were still opportunities for me to support and resolve coding errors in person. When doing this I or other volunteers were able at times to give wider perspectives on the details of specific coding concepts and wider computational patterns. For example in terms of process, rather than writing code from first principles, this 'code patching' technique and subsequent debugging more closely represents the kinds of skills used by computer professionals on an everyday basis.

### Tensions revolved by a shift to MakeCode Arcade

The emergence of a new tool for game authoring which shared many of the goals of my documentation and similar structures to those in the phaser game making library led to my reconsideration of Phaser as the only or right tool for this programme. The new authoring MakeCode Arcade is an open source Microsoft educational project which is a spin-off of the MakeCode tool originally designed to support the programming of the Micro:bit microcontroller. It is a block based programming environment which offers hints of use in the colour coding of the main functions of each code block.

It appeared fruitful to undertake a similar object on making a game for change using this new, more self-contained toolset. This was also partly in response to reflections on the loose collection of interconnected authoring tools that were used in phases 1-4 of the program. The authenticity of these separate online tools, that at times participants swapped out with favourite tools of their own, had lead to interesting observations of digital literacy associated with movement and translation of digital objects from one website to another. Clearly the use of this tool reduces the potential for the development of these rich practices. However I was interested to know how the self-contained approach of a tool which had limited audio and graphical editors within the coding environment would shift learning outcomes.

I haven't started to compare data in detail between the different authoring tools. However, Initial data from participant interviews does suggests a reduction of a general feeling of learner stress due to the simplified environment. With participants saying they were less likely to be 'bogged down' and thus that tension of unhelpful stuck-ness appears partially resolved. The reduced time using external tools, especially the online pixel art editor, did shift time spend on graphics by participants away from this activity towards ones which I began to prioritise in the emerging set of learning dimensions. Although this reduction of the more straight-forward and social task of pixel art design and application seemed to cause a reduction in some of the more spontaneous moments of peer exchange and encouragement. Due to the decreased likelihood of syntax and structure errors, there also was a reduction of time when games were in a broken state. This was useful as it fitted well with the increased focus on the value of regular play testing in later phases.

The process of coming back to create a supporting resources for this new tool allowed me to recreate and refocus supporting documents and activities with the core goals of the germ cell in mind. Additional work done to to help participants to navigate a path between the more concrete and abstract elements of the learning dimensions for this generation of supporting documents created in phase 6 are explored in the later section on secondary stimuli.
