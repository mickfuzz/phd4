## Intro
In a previous chapter in this collection I outlined the opportunities of a project based approach to learning computing and in particular the craft of coding. In this chapter I explore the potential of Computer Game Making as a way of undertaking computing projects in line with the principles of PBL and UDL.

I'll make a summary of research around project approaches to game making and draw out some of the benefits and some elements that are special about making games.

My aim is to engage with research on game making but also to keep things grounded. To do this l I look at tensions to game making approaches especially those that impact the use of game making in the classroom.

As a fruit of my own research with families making games together, I share a framework which aims to incorporate some of the thinking and techniques that are explored in relation to research.

### Context Background (UK)

Research on the use of games in education has often focused on game playing and the use of specialist educational games. In the context of computing however the promise if game making especially to develop coding skills is also explore to a lesser but still significant degree.

The RSA report After the Reboot[-@the_royal_society_after_2017] examined classroom practice and updated research after x years since the introduction of a new Computing curriculum in the UK. The report found that girls, ethnic minorities and students of lower socio-economic status were all less likely to take computing as a subject at GCSE level.

One of the areas of promise they outlined was the use of game making as a way of increasing engagement in the process of coding. The review highlighted several area of promise but which needed more research. The areas were the promise of using games for engagement, use of game patterns and involvement in girls in coding and social and cultural aspects of coding [@waite_pedagogy_2017].

-   transition from following tutorials to creating new games;
-   using a design pattern specific pedagogy for teaching gaming rather than teaching programming constructs;
-   social and cultural dimension of gaming;
-   gender differences.

This chapter explores these elements in general in the first part and then in relation to my own research in the second part.

### Research on benefits (and uniqueness) of Game Making

<!-- This section uses two other main sources beyond the review by Waite as part of the After the Reboot report. First is one by Kafai and Burke, another is that of Earp and colleagues who looked at the use of game making to build 21st Century skills.  -->

In the following section we draw from educational research to explore what is already known to be beneficial in terms of game making.

There is a lot of research that details the potential benefits and areas of learning of game making as base. The following summary from Kafai and Burke is a good summary place to start.
[*https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00461520.2015.1124022*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00461520.2015.1124022)

Game making is inherently project based making so we can draw on research that outlines the benefits of that approach. It is also closely related to a multi-media coding approach. Some research has taken a wide view of the potential of game making [@peppler_what_2007] including many advantages that are common to other creative computing projects. In this section, I'll make a summary of some of the wider claims and then take a more focused approach highlighting areas that are unique or particularly applicable to game making.

<!-- ## Inclusion and the Social and Cultural Dimensions of Gaming -->

Waite's review highlighted social and cultural approaches to game making and the importance of gender. Key studies have addressed the issue of how to use games and other techniques to overcome exclusion from the culture of computing  [@kafai_diversifying_2017; @kafai_beyond_2014]. More recent definitions of inclusion consider aspects beyond SEND issues. If students feel excluded from the school cultures then making bridges to home cultures is vital. One way to make those connections to home cultures is to allow for more choice of what can be incorporated into computing projects.

<!-- From this lens -- often called a participation model of inclusion -- more 'universal' designs for learning which prioritise choice and offer ways of learners choosing a pathway which speaks to them. (So Wot) -->

A cultural-social approach to education values the importance of mediation, cultural artefacts, and the joint emergence of new tools and practices. The kind of research to study a coding work environment, communities of practice, and communities of learners has advantages as it allows;

-   exploration of social/ 21st C skills
-   inclusive and motivating approaches via authentic projects
-   the incorporation of funds on knowledge from the learners home life


<!-- Kafai and Burke explore these dimensions in their review of research. Kafai and Peppler make links to areas of professional competencies arguing that technical, creative and critical practices of working with new media. The widening of scope beyond purely technical practices of coding and information technology practices. -->

<!-- My work is inspired in part by the pioneering computing education project called the 5th Dimension project which involved undergraduate students in an after school. It has also been made possible by the similar EdLab programme at Manchester Met University, which also involves students in service learning projects. The mix of student helpers, local young people and in this case their parents gives a rich mix of perspectives which may not be possible for your setting but which has helped evolve a learning design. Weaknesses in the approach were made visible in the responses by young people and adults, and then addressed in the next session or next iteration of the program. -->

<!-- Include only if relevant to inclusion -->
### Benefits - Social and 21st Century Skills

Project-based game making is inherently collaborative, involves creative design and problem solving. This is a good base for the development of 21st Century skills as potential benefits. The term 21st Century Skills is used quite flexibly in educational research but there is broad understanding that they cover skills like social skills, self reflection, cultural awareness and a range of technical abilities that allow participation in information society.

 Studies [@baytak_case_2010] including my own show the potential of making games to create a collaborative classroom community. Learners are often keen to share their games for others to play and play those of others. This motivation can be leveraged to provide detailed feedback.

In a previous chapter I examined the use of design frameworks to help create computing projects. One of the stages of the framework way sharing creations as a way to progressively improving designs. This incentive to revisit and revise work is valuable as a way to reinforce concepts and practices.

The social nature of game making can be activated in other ways. In a later section I propose that there are different kinds of game makers which you may be able to motivate in different ways.

<!-- move later -->
The creation of a game that a peer group will play is a strong motivational factor both within the larger scale of a project but also within the scope of a single lesson. Ending with peer playing and review of games can concentrate minds to get the evolving games to in a playable state.

<!-- Include details of reviews or not?

 But which had this as a core focus of the research. The exception being peer programming and reviewing each others games.
-->

Studies agree that while there is great potential in game making to build such skills, more research is needed as may studies focused on observations of collaborative skills in passing rather than the core element.

Another way of framing this is that collaboration is not just the end goal but a useful educational approach in itself.

### Benefits of Project approaches

In previous chapter the inclusive possibilities of creative computing projects were summarised as

- allowing differentiation through learner choice based
- real projects that can be shared.
- more


#### Authentic projects creating real results

An important concept in both design and inclusive approaches to education that of the imagined user and to make projects as authentic as possible to increase learner motivation.
Authentic projects work to increase motivation in the following ways

- the experience of the real or imagined user of the game or other design helps focus learners to keep progressing towards this tangible goal
- the end goal has may have a social value that can be publicly share for kudos
- learners understand that the resulting knowledge and skills is not inert and can be applied outside of the classroom
- draw from research on authentic for more

In the last section explored the value of a collaborative and social approach to game making within the class room. Many schools enter online game making competitions or wider creative competitions like the Coolest Project. You may be able to do similar thing on a small scale by providing a frame for your game making.

Game making projects can be auth

This is explored later in part x of the 3M game making framework.

### Benefits -- Incorporating Funds of knowledge

One of the aspects of games that make them for all demographics(including those more that are engaging less in computing), is the ability for teachers to draw on the out of school interests and experience of young people.

The concept of funds on knowledge or Discourses was explored and promoted by Gee in the well respected book What Video Games have to Teach us about Learning and Literacy. The perspective there was on DIY and home communities and the potential for X

The concept of funds of knowledge is draw on Gutiérrez [-@gutierrez_syncretic_2011] in the promotion of a concept of creating third space, neither home life, nor a traditional classroom. This kind of third space is perfect to create new kinds of working relationships between students and with teachers as facilitators. This study explores third spaces in the context of migrant communities and has a focus on inclusion in learning cultures.

Thus this process is this useful not only for an inclusive approach it is also good for navigating computing projects too.

Design patters are a recognisable fund of known
While previous studies were warey of games as a male culture, more widespread family and casual game cultures exist and are easier to access.

More research is needed on ways to draw out attitudes and knowledge of game cultures and to make this as accessible as possible. see later. (missions? methods?)


The concepts of a third space normally happens outside of the school environment, thus the challenge exists how to create such a third space within the classroom. Suggestions now, and the methods part of the 3M framework (drama process).

<!--
Move this to Missions?
My study began with Home Educators both parents and children asking us to help them to make the most of the kids interest in MineCraft and similar creative computer games. How could skills like coding and other skills be learned while young people were making something that appealed to them? -->



To allow students to bring their own home funds on knowledge into their work teachers can adopt the following techniques.

-   Allow students to base their coding projects on well known game tropes or genres.
-   Allow for choice over the narrative of the game and the characters to allow for student choice


## Tensions (perhaps move some into 3M)(and into blog posts if not)

see below

- simplicity of tools with future potential - low floor high ceiling wide walls
- tensions around starting code from scratch or from a template



## My Study's 3M Framework

In this section I share a learning framework and process which starts with a platform game that was barely functional (half-baked) and invited the novice coders to work together in ones or twos to solve it using a selection of supporting materials.

This framework was developed as part of my on-going research. It was developed with KS2 primary class and with families in a Homeschool environments

I have used a particular set of technologies, Make Code and Phaser. However this framework and approach can apply to any game making project approaches.

The advantage here is that the process has been designed to be accessible to parents, teachers and learners - the missions, map and methods are like those in a game designed to give the participants feedback.


My study started with a platform game that was barely functional (half-baked) and invited the novice coders to work together in ones or twos to solve it.

### Missions (using Game Patterns and secret side-missions)

My Missions existed on different levels. Some linked to game mechanics -some to more systems thinking - some to do with engagement, social learning and reflection.

The core of my learning design is the use of game design patterns as a relatable way for student to choose their paths and to structure the support through coding concepts linked to these patterns.

Many open world games have a concept of a main mission and then optional side missions. The main mission supported by a narrative device of Aliens coming to earth to judge our games. The main goal of the main mission was to create playable games.

The process of making an open world game is to provide the player with a series of choices but also to have restrictions to the wide extent of the world/choices. For the learners in this design I created, from the requests of early iterations of the program, a list of different kinds of patterns.

\<\<INSERT GRAPHIC HERE\>\>

In addition, I created a way to support the different learning preferences of learners (Bartle types) with side missions. Some of the missions were social in nature -- go find someone who x and ask them y.Others were more anti-social in nature - try to mess with someone's game

### Maps

Tension between student choice and the potential for learner stress andconfusion was something that I struggled with for some time. While theend results were often really positive, I couldn't ignore that stress,and wonder if that was the reason we lost participants along the way.

To try to resolve this tension I drew on the use of another technique from open world adventure games -- Maps. The has been a growing tendency in socio-cultural research to look at the learning that is happening in any given activity from an observational perspective. That is to say that rather than deciding what you want to teach and planning around that, you choose an existing authentic activity and map the learning that actually happens in reality.

This is the approach adopted in an interesting research program which looked at hands on tinkering with Science exhibits in a museum setting.In an article called -- It looks like fun but what are they learning --Bevan and Petrich worked with educators to examine video footage of families interacting with exhibits. The resulting map of learning dimensions is notable as not only are the underlying science concepts explored but, more general skills and attributes and helping behaviour common to an exploratory process is also present.

### Methods (Inclusive)

So the third M stand for methods, specifically inclusive methods whichhelp with participation and some of the potential benefits of usinggames a medium for making computing project explored in the first partof this chapter. .

## Tensions (perhaps move some into 3M)(and into blog posts if not)

Focus on accordances of tools to build towards model and with inclusion in mind.

### Tension balancing simplicity of game making Tools and the flexibility of the product created.

<!-- Needs editing down massively -->

There are several good options for game making depending on what your aims are. As computing teachers it is likely that one of our core aims will be building familiarity and fluency of use of code constructs.

**For my own design which is later** I want to be clear that this is not about a particular use of software. A similar approach can be taken now matter what you choose. I used javascript and MakeCode but a similar approach could be taken with Scratch or PyGame or any of the other code based game making tools available.

I think is helpful however to have an environment that is friendly to game making - and includes aspects like gravity and collisions that are potentially tricky to code if you are starting from scratch.

Both Phaser and MakeCode do have gravity, collisions, lives and certain other game design patterns available.

Examples...

In phaser one line ... sets gravity
In MakeCode acceleration in the y axis does the trick neatly.

The reason I'm taking the trouble to show you this is that Scratch is often used to make games which works up to a point, but then the block become really tricky to get the right kind of behaviour - the complexity mounts and the actually game play of the games created never quite reaches something that you would really like to play repeatedly. The sense of challenge and possibility of progression is extremely hard to achieve.

The use of phaser for my first attempts was interesting as the process involved a new tool set for me. The combination of a code playground, js framework, external tools to create art Piskel and

It was very authentic, a factor which is judged to be good for motivational factors, However my initial idea of participants participating in and gaining from being part of a community of professional and hobbyist javascript game makers did not seem realistic for this project.

I did resolve this issue of tool complexity by using the new MakeCode Arcade tool. Like scratch

### Tensions around starting code from scratch or from a template

Getting participants up and running from ideas, to a design to then starting to code too a long time when starting from first principles. In order to reduce the test of their patience I quickly adopted the use of a template to help them to get to grips with coding

The framework provided the following advantages, a working example of code syntax, and a structure of variables and functions already working together.

The combination of working with it, gaffer taping bits on to it, and then playing a game to analyse the core line by line.

One participant wrote "that was a great moment - when after struggling to add text on to the code, we played the code matching game. We realised how much we had actually picked up that process".

Adding onto the template had helped the participant to read and understand code.

This is line with a lot of the research indicated that at good way of starting is by remixing and altering the code of others.

This is foundational to the Use Modify Create framework and also forms an important part of the Scratch community.

Without an existing community of games however I wanted to try another approach - that of using a Half Baked game. A concept was introduced to the field by Kynigos who describes the process of starting with a deliberately incomplete or inappropriate game to provoke students to change it.


## Challenges - and how they may link to a classroom setting

You would think from the glowing potential of game making from the reviews of the literature that this would be a normal part of computing education, and well supported in terms of how to teach it.

Of course, real life is more complicated than that. Rather than there being one pedagogy that maximises the potential of using game making in the classroom, it is important to recognise the diversity of objectives of both teachers and learners in the process of making games.

In the last section we look out one learning design and how that aimed to overcome those tensions. But in this section rather than trying to solve problems -- I am highlighting them and you can draw your own conclusions.

The following sections aim not to give a best practice approach. Rather they acknowledge the complexity and diversity of classroom situations. Also, there are significant challenges in how to put it into practice especially in a class setting, even more so within the constraints of the curriculum.

As such this section uses data drawn from the wider research -- I also cross reference this with my own observations from my game making studies.

We also look at the resulting understanding of the emerging tensions. This is a good place to start as you may find similar tensions in your teaching environments (be they formal classroom settings or more informal club or out of school projects).

## Challenge -- with such an abundance of riches, which to prioritise?

The potential dimensions of learning in Kafai and Burke's review of research is huge and diverse. One critique of this review is that it is so all encompassing that it does not offer a lot of help our guidance getting started. In the previous section benefits listed were; 21st C, as a way of teaching other subjects through cross curriculum projects and a way of developing coding and information technology skills. Heaven help teachers who try and teach all of these competencies in game making lessons.

In reality, teachers must prioritise certain learning outcomes over others. If you are promoting teamwork, then coding concepts may have to be de-prioritised -- if you choose to deepen subject knowledge of maths by making a fractions game then something else may need to go.

This is borne out by Kafai and Peppler - can't find this - who say ""the diversity of learning and that there is more than one learning outcome is something teachers need to be aware of.

For my study, I ended up de-prioritising reflection on more general communications skills (21st C skills) and highlighting coding concepts and systems concepts.

### Time considerations and classroom culture

As explored in the previous chapter, these approaches may work most easily in a computer club or other informal settings, but projects are successfully integrated into school settings by many educators.

This is relevant to project based approaches in general. Some of the ways to overcome this are explore in previous chapter. Others are

### Starting a community from scratch

In all the programs I ran only one parent and one student had experience of coding. This process of starting up from scratch is challenging.

How to start a community of learners?

The process of building a community can be done in various ways. Warm up games, sharing progress, activities which build a team spirit. I undertook many of these. However the time this took up took away from the time on task actually coding the games and problem solving. This often led to frustration, it felt as if we were just getting going and time was up.
