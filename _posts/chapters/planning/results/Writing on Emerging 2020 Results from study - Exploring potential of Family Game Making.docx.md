**Writing on Emerging 2020 Results from study - Exploring potential of Family Game Making**

**Meta-notes as writing**

May want to reorder based on case studies as they emerge

**Introduction**

The purpose of this piece of writing is to follow up the [[RD2 process]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OjsXOjOcw0LW0y2M7IOqGuOYLpwEsNZIT-F34YL4w6M/edit) and begin to identify emerging results from existing sources of data gathered as part of my study so far. It also seeks to use concepts explored in similar studies that use AT to practice the process of expressing practice oriented observations within the framework this tradition offers.

As such, it uses understandings and terms explored in the RD2 without explanation and gives a summary of early results in the first part of this writing and subsequent updates, which is developed by further exploration of these themes in relation to existing research, following this are emerging tables which represent summaries of concepts which are starting to coalesce into a guiding framework for this research, finally examples are taken from my existing data set to explore these concepts with a greater degree of specificity. Due to the emergent nature of this writing it is structured in a report form to allow for quick scanning of themes and later revision.

Summary of RD2 Data Analysis ----------------------------

The following themes of emerging results were identified at RD2 stage from analysis of journal notes, video and screen capture of participants in making session and subsequent participant interviews.

1.  *Early contradictions between my goals and those of families;*     > resolved by increased scaffolding using printed materials and     > process guidance.

2.  *Tensions and resolutions related to programme goals and family     > culture*; Media literacy and digital fluency were of higher     > importance than imagined and there was a high divergence of     > familiar patterns of collaboration.

3.  *Tensions related to community norms, tools and participant goals:*     > the role of supporting resources which evolved from step-by-step     > guides to those supporting dual approach encouraging both a shared     > framework and diverse learner pathways supported by a menu-based     > approach to new additions to games.

4.  *Observations on frustrations from coding errors;* different kinds     > of errors were observed and tactics to overcome frustrations     > emerge from this analysis.

Exploration and Deepening of Observations hemes in relation to Existing Research --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section links to deeper questions of methodology and more domain specific examples. As such it is quite ambitious at this stage and may need a lot of subsequent work.

Summary of how the above extend or clarify the points 1-4 from above

While broad tensions were identified in relation to the component parts of the AT systems. In the first section I extend the use terminology outline the concept of mediation and Activity as a unit of analysis and explore divergent objectives of interacting systems.

This writing compared to early explorations de-prioritises to some extent the cataloguing of broader social and cultural dimensions of the learning design -- while still interesting and relevant -- to concentrate on what is unique about the object of game making compared to similar creative coding programmes.

### Mediating Artefacts and Activity - in relation to this interventions Tool Use and Documentation 

Summary - look at mediation to facilitation of internalisation. Different kinds of mediation and move to community focus -

It is useful to understand the role of community in the use of tools to develop participant understanding in relation to V's understanding of an individuals' internalisation of concepts from interaction with a community but also in the ongoing creation and contribution to existing community processes.

This wider scope of examination is a key advantage to use of Activity to enhance mediation as a concept. This is particularly true in these formative workshops as often workshops start with scant documentation and rely on the immediacy of participant feedback to determine which supporting tools are given priority for development.

A useful first step is to list and describe the range of tools participants in game making programmes are interacting with. Different interactions of the game making programme have varying toolset a. I\'ve chosen the third version.

Overview of tools, perhaps in table form by generation of intervention, but only one to start with.

Screenshots or photos!?

-   Game authoring environment, thimble, glitch.com, makecode arcade

-   The starting template code and design decisions within that code

-   Games, bomb and shield, the code identification games matching,

-   Step by step documentation, fm book, handout challenges,

-   Maps, menus of game patterns to add, printed or created lists,

Other mediating tools and community forums for activity were considered:

-   Profesional online forum

-   Interaction with professional mentors

**Characteristics of tools**

The process of choosing this toolset and evaluating the efficacy is documented in journal notes

**Evolution of toolsets **

Since the completion of the RD2 a further programme has been undertaken with a full set of data capture using a new block coding system called MakeCode. The following observations on the above factors can be extracted from journal notes and changes in the programme design.

On 2) the use of text coding and specifically javascript was an important element of my contribution to the first learning design. However, while the authenticity and complexity of the multiple authoring environments certainly led to tensions that the family had to learn to overcome through progress in digital literacy and the code syntax, the danger that there was a **disproportionate amount of time spent** in this area thus reducing that spent of different kinds of problem solving and in other learning outcomes which seemed more unique to the the potential of game making.

This analysis of mismatch is exemplified in the case study , vignette of S and T , linked here , included as appendix.

To resolve this tension and frustrations of **time blockage**s reflected back by participant which emerge as reflections in my journal and in participant interviews I embraced a more systematic structure of resources to guide with a greater level of specificity see figure as an example - of guiding where in the document the cut and paste code needed to go. Rather than writing code from first principles, this 'code patching' technique more closely represents the kinds of skills used by computer professionals.

In making decisions like the one to include extra visual scaffolding in step by step documentations. I am balancing here many different factors of concern in the complex learning environment. These include; authenticity of programming environment and language, use of the existing structure of the phaser library, the learning process of participants getting stuck and having to resolve tensions, my time limits providing individual support as a facilitator of a group, and the patience of participants when they encounter incomplete documentation.

While each stage of the process of adding game elements was documented in as complete a fashion as possible mistakes were still made and thus in theory there was still opportunity for me as a facilitator to support and resolve coding errors in person. When doing this I or other volunteers were able at times to give wider perspectives on the details of specific coding concepts and wider computational patterns (see frameworks and terms section below)

MORE WORK TO BE DONE HERE LINKING - CRAFT, PATCHING, MAGPIE, GLITCHING DIFFERENTS USING OF THE SAME TOOLS

The resolution of these tensions are present in [[this chapter from the supporting book]{.underline}](https://en.flossmanuals.net/phaser-game-making-in-glitch/_full/#adding-game-states) of resources for participants written in a way to explore the value of the craft approach to coding.

The chapter above attempts to resolve the tension of diverse approaches that participants offered as their preferred way of working.

As previously mentioned, in post analysis of the screen capture, and participant feedback in interviews it appeared that a great deal of time was being lost in the mechanics of moving images and sound from one online tool to another.

While this offered a multitude of opportunities to build digital literacy skills and draw upon helping strategies of both children and parents, there were significant tensions and frustrations engendered by this disparate approach.

The emergence of a new tool for game authoring which shared many of the goals of my documentation and similar structures to those in the phaser game making library led to my reconsideration of Phaser as the only or right tool for this programme. In any case it appeared fruitful to undertake a similar object on making a game for change using this new, more self-contained toolset.

MakeCode Arcade is an open source Microsoft educational project which is a spin-off of the MakeCode tool originally designed to support the programming of the Micro:bit microcontroller. It is a block based programming environment which offers hints of use in the colour coding of the main functions of each code block.

On 1) and 3) There is a**n ongoing tension of guidance verses choice** which my on-going documentation efforts continues to address. Key to this are my emerging understandings surrounding the utility of *game patterns* to act as a potential as a starting fund of knowledge and to use these understandings to facilitate a variety of learning dimensions engendered by this starting point.

In evaluating the motives of a shift to Makecode, other learning environments can be considered as can my own motivation for the initial choice of Phaser as a framework.

My starting values here -echoed by other programmes explore elsewhere in my reviews - included the empowerment agenda or 'lifting the hood' on technologies that surrounds us. Thus the use of text code as a tool, one normally obscured from us, had that benefit. We can compare game making tools which much higher graphical support including the interface of Kodu for game making.

### Double Stimulation and Processes

The concept of double stimulation originates with Vygotsky and is made more systematic with interpretation by 3GAT and specifically Change Laboratory investigations. It is framed as "a particular method of experimental investigation... using two groups of stimuli... One group of stimuli has the function of a task toward which the activity of the experimental subject is directed, whilst the other takes on the function of signs which help to organize the activity" ([[Vygotsky, 1931/1994, p. 208]{.underline}](https://www-sciencedirect-com.mmu.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S2210656115000045#bb0400)).

For Sannino "Although second stimuli play a crucial mediating function, double stimulation cannot be subsumed to the general idea of mediation by symbolic tools"

*So the difference should be clarified and can be done so using the specifics on the study. As should the concept of volitional action. But how exactly? *

To express this within the framework of Activity Theory we can see interaction with a community and its rules and DOL, as the frequent source of such feedback stimuli.

Most commonly described as method, double stimulation, put simply, involves providing experimental participants with the means to express an internal states of mind in response to a task set as a first stimulus.

Thus double here is more apt than second, to get away from an idea that order is important. We can think of double stimulation as a different kind of interaction, which may take various forms, and happen at more than one occasion. (see summary of Change Laboratory later)

Sannino, A., 2015. The principle of double stimulation: A path to volitional action. Learning, Culture and Social Interaction 6, 1--15. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lcsi.2015.01.001

The method is often used to describe collaboration initiated by the experimenter with participants, to explore the goal of the participants. (Blunden 2010)

It is not clear to me what parts of my design would could as more straightforward tools which act as mediating objects or which count as double stimulation.

My spoken interactions with participants directly fall under this category very explicitly, with my conversations often starting along the lines, what are you working on. This informal but very direct inquiries are documented in ongoing recordings of conversations. My own journal notes also aim to track the effectiveness of these encounters. Often in retrospect I note my failure to point out a particular learning experience.

This focus on the immediate concrete and not the pattern in the interaction was appropriate in the early interventions when there were no supporting resources, however a greater shift to external resources allows facilitator interactions to the area of ds type input , about specifics of terms of computational concepts used, and about wider patterns of computational design. (Explored later).

Thus my reluctance to set paths, and to maximise choice ended up being more restrictive, as access to my time became a bottleneck. Thus provoking inactivity or a very bounded restrictive activity from participants. A concept explored in feedback from version1 of the course. Appendix.

In addition the use of different kinds of documentation can be analysed from this perspective. Varieties of documentation include printed how to sheets or their online equivalents, code examples, graphical menus of possible game patterns to add to projects.

Beyond these more straight-forward tutorial based help process, there are more unusual processes more explicitly designed to serve two roles, the primary one is to encourage explicit goal setting to develop participant agency, the secondary one is the

The use of process drama to aid overcoming conflicts between participants in setting goals is of great interest to me.

One intervention used maps which listed different game patterns as islands,

These were created to echo a quest based experience, were co-created by participants as a way of giving greater ownership over the process. The idea was that as participants identified different tasks within the wider goal of making a game, they would move a physical marker representing themselves to a new area of the map. While this process had limited impact, some research data of participants interactions contains reference to the map and moving to a new area. It is likely that my own discomfort with the physical appearance of the map, and an intuitive feeling that it was distracting to overall processes of making, and my forgetfulness in referring back to the map regularly in sessions were a barrier in an effective evaluation of its impact.

**Interventionist Processes and suitability of Expansive Learning / CL model**

In line with x , my research is clearly interventionist.

To conclude this section I will make a brief summary of emergent thoughts on the suitability of Expansive Learning / CL model to my interventions exploring potential and limitations and early thoughts on other possible directions.

The move from second generation activity theory as conceptualised by Leontiev to Engestrom's more third generation has been conceptualised as a move not only to a more precise systematised taxonomy of different elements of an activity system along with characteristic triangular diagrams - (described by (blunden?) as a shift from cultural psychology to a systematic sociology of organisations?)) but also Engestrom's own change of focus towards a more broadly interventionist and organisational focused approach.

Many researchers using AT in the West are influenced by the Change Laboratory approach outlined in detail by Engestrom around principles of both double stimulation (at regular intervals), and formative change focused intervention over time.

While interested in the CL process, there are adaptations that I have made based on the divergent goals of my participants which do not align with the kind of workplace structure of the intervention.

Also CL and to a great extent the 3GAT, rely on a already formed concept of Community and Division of Labour and Norms, rather than one that is being created by the facilitatory. Of course this does on prevent the use of the model, it does however not suit an off the shelf application of CL processes.

Indeed there may be other expansive models which are more appropriate. For example the work of Heathcote is promising in the way roles are created and breathed into life by the facilitator to accelerate an adoption of principles of practice.

This imbues a fictional narrative frame with power to communicate culture and expectations rapidly and with reduced manpower involved. This has then great potential but it is not clear how much the specialist nature of the practitioner skills allow adoption of these techniques.

My early experiments have mixed results in terms of regularity of the upkeep of the fiction in the making environments. Partly due to my own reticence and partly due to prioritisation of primary tutorial creation rather than resources for meta-development, navigation and other outputs of double stimulation.

### Germ Cell - Rising to the concrete

I am using Activity Theory as my key methodological approach. One key concept in AT is the identification of a Germ Cell of knowledge which Engestrom develops from Davydov in the tradition of maxist thoughts of rising to the concrete. see

From Blunden "\...when Activity Theorists identify a relation or action or concept or artefact as the "germ cell" of a complex process, they mean that the relation is the simplest possible

relation which will over time develop into the more complex process."

A possible emerging concept which may at act as a Germ Cell is use of Game Patterns as a source of actions which can expand both to become more concrete in application, and more abstract in conception after then have been enacted. To clarify this statement we can explore a more tangible example.

Game patterns are often intuitively understood patterns of systemic behaviour which are brought by both younger and older family members as extremely funds of knowledge. The germ idea is that these starting points can be both expanded into the more specific, detailed completion of the idea in code by engaging with the line by line, character by character into what Resnick and Bevan Computational Concepts (see below)

**On Computational Patterns**

These findings follow on from the work of Repenning and Basawapatna (Basawapatna et al., 2010) on computational patterns which found utility in specific recommendations for facilitators and designers working in this area beyond the more abstract interpretations of computational thinking.

Scalable Game Design aided a wider transfer of learning to science simulations and excludes the mechanics of computational concepts. While my emergent model is similar in the progression of specific and relatable game patterns into a wider perspective more generalisable and transferable conceptions of computational patterns it also encourages a narrower focus on the specific computational concepts as outlined by Resnick and Brennan.

Examples created for the second and third iteration of the course outline some of the user generated patterns.

![](media/image3.png){width="5.130208880139983in" height="7.081918197725284in"}

The kind of Game Making patterns above intersect with both the following dimensions

-   Wider concepts: Games as a systems (components, balance, feedback -     > see Torres & Salen) & Computational Patterns (see my coding     > definition based on computing design patterns)

<!-- -->

-   Narrower mechanics: the foundational concepts of coding sequences,     > loops, logic, data ( as per Resnick's first definition of     > "computational concepts")

![](media/image1.png){width="5.109375546806649in" height="4.855543525809273in"}

The resulting implication is that there are design techniques for the designer and teaching techniques for the facilitator to link learner led game patterns and ideas with the wider and narrower patterns.

I see the game patterns that my users identify and want to implement in their games as a middle layer between the computational concepts the nuts and bolts, and the wider more abstract area of design patterns and computational thinking.

The kind of Game Making patterns above intersect with both the following dimensions

• Wider concepts: Games as a systems (components, balance, feedback - see Torres & Salen) & Computational Patterns (see my coding definition based on computing design patterns)

• Narrower mechanics: the foundational concepts of coding sequences, loops, logic, data ( as per Resnick's first definition of "computational concepts")
