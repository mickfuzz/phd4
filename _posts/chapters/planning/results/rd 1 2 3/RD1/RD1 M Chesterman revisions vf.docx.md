**Investigating the Potential of Family Game Making to Support Collaborative Production**

**Background**

The increasing prevalence and complexity of digital technology and the subsequent lag in associated teaching strategies is addressed in a recent report on UK computer education (The Royal Society, 2017). The report highlights the potential of digital game making to enhance computing provision and need for more research into this area. It also foregrounds Wing's (2006) conception of computational thinking, which prioritises abstract thought processes and pre-planning, as a key component of a computing curriculum.

Game making is also happening in informal settings including museums, libraries via initiatives like Code Club and Coder Dojo. Here, family members create games together using accessible technology. While these family learning environments have great potential to inform practice in collaborative digital making sparse research exists.

This lack of research concerning collaborative, learner lead approaches is disappointing as pioneers of digital game making Papert and Turkle (1990) explored their value in early studies. Subsequent studies have instead prioritised individual computing progress using particular software tools rather than community activities to participant communication and collaboration in digital making. This study will design and explore a pedagogical framework for family game making in informal settings which aims to address these deficits.

**Methodology**

Constructivism will form the core theoretical foundation for this study. Based on constructivism's epistemological belief that knowledge is social and collaboratively constructed, this study will focus on the importance of learner experience. Thus I adopt an applied constructivist approach of student centred learning which highlights participant communication and collaboration (Grabinger and Dunlap, 1995).\ \ **Research Questions**

1.  What methods currently exist to facilitate collaborative learning in     > digital game making environments and how effective do participants     > and facilitators perceive them to be?

2.  What effect does family involvement have on the potential for     > collaborative pedagogical approaches to digital game making?

3.  What effect does a pedagogical model focused on collaborative design     > have on parent and child learner experience of digital game making     > ?

4.  How do new technologies allow experimental processes to capture and     > analyse data to study collaborative learning in a complex     > environment?

**Research Context & Methods**

Research will happen in three phases (timeline in separate document). Phase activities are outlined in the table below. Data gathering will be undertaken at twice yearly game making courses which I facilitate for MMU's EdLab project. Courses comprise 6 workshops and with 12-15 participants comprising Home Educator parents and children aged 8-12.

**P1:** My initial pedagogical approach will be based on my existing practice of multimodal, collaborative game making. Interviews with four regional game making facilitators will be conducted to articulate, expand and revise this framework. The resulting design will be tested with a pilot group. Two subsequent collaborative design workshops will record participant feedback and develop alterations to the design of the intervention using a participatory process in line with the study's methodology. These workshops will allow exploration of difference in experience of adult learners and young people for each activity and explore possible tensions in process.

**P2:** I will conduct three workshops to test emergent data gathering methods targeted at recording learner experience and participant interactions. Methods will include screen capture of collaborative coding, 360º video of work areas and use of participant audio diaries. The goal is to support naturalistic data analysis without interrupting learning experience or generating unwieldy datasets. Rich digital recordings and diverse artefacts will enhance the user perspective in keeping with the constructivist perspective of the study. Reduced costs of 360º video cameras may provide an opportunity to create new research methodologies which may contribute to the field, as per RQ4.

**P3:** The bulk of data gathering will consist of via two iterations of the evolving pedagogical design using data collection methods emerging from P2. I will take the role of participant observer and focus on user perspective of the learning environment via journal entries, analysis of in-situ video and audio recordings and 12 subsequent in-depth group interviews with family groups to explore areas of emerging interest.

The following table summarises the contents of each phase (a timeline is included as a separate document).

**Data Analysis**

In P1 a literature review will inform research design and creation of a thematic coding scheme (after Braun and Clarke) to analyse my pilot workshop journal observations and interviews with regional educators.

P2 and P3 are characterised by an on-going analysis of data further refining each iteration of the resultant pedagogical design. While data collection is expected to be extensive, key journal entries will illuminate focal areas. Interview data and digital artefacts of these specific moments will be analysed with a particular focus on group dynamics via interaction process analysis (Bales, 2001).

The participatory approach of this study, informed by the philosophical underpinning of constructivism suits an analytical framework capable of interpretation of a rich, multi-threaded and reciprocal learning environment over time. Game making comprises creation of art, audio, story and code elements that are combined into a final product. Thus Activity Theory will be used to allow interpretation of nested activities as interrelated units of analysis each with their own power relations, helping behaviour, mediating objects and problem solving strategies (Engeström, 1999).

AT will be used as a framework in the emergent stages of the project to support a collaborative design process. This will be done though in a visual and accessible way using artefacts and sketches of interactions created in pilot workshops. The goal is to develop vocabulary to aid self reporting of learner experience of each activity and to help identify possible contradictions within them as a stimulus for participant input to the next iteration of the learning design.
