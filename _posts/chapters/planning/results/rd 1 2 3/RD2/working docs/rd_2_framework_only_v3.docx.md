    1.  Aims of Study          --------------

**Context and Need**

-   Coding and digital fluency increasingly required (including STEM and     > beyond) and access gaps exist

-   UK response to formalise CS education in curriculum, but resulted in     > decreased IT provision

-   Potential identified in RS report to use game making projects to     > teach computing

-   Potential offered by engagement at home in game playing, to motivate     > game making as educational activity.

-   Digital Making via project work has benefits beyond inequality of     > access to STEM pipeline, 21C skills, and the media literacy needed     > to be engaged citizens

-   More educational designs / project programmes need to be developed     > to support development of 21C skills. I propose a good way to do     > this is via expansive learning in non-formal environments, expose,     > analyse and resolve design tensions, before scaling to formal     > environments.

B**road approach**

-   This study takes as a starting point a social historical approach     > aimed to support analysis and development of learning in making     > environments (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Newman et al., 1989).

**Research Questions and** **changes**

-   What methods currently exist to facilitate collaborative learning in     > non-formal digital making environments?

-   What factors should be considered when designing for learner choice     > and collaboration in digital game making environments?

-   ~~What effect does family involvement have on the potential for     > collaborative pedagogical approaches to digital game making?~~

-   What effect does a pedagogical model focused on collaborative design     > and learner choice have on parent and child learner experiences of     > digital game making ?

-   ~~How do new technologies allow experimental processes to capture     > and analyse data to study collaborative learning in a complex     > environment?~~

Summary of changes:

-   Two questions are dropped which will be covered by other questions,     > specifically the family nature of the project is not a primary     > focus, and the question on methods.

-   One question is added which is the additional focus on the process     > of designing for learner choice and collaboration as the novel     > learning design has generated extensive notebook material based on     > intersection of theory and practice.

    2.  Literature Review         -----------------

### Game Making Overview / Introduction

-   Reviews of learning dimensions in research on game making as an     > educational activity (Earp, 2015; Kafai and Burke, 2015), find     > some personal dimensions are relatively well established,     > (computing knowledge, subject knowledge), social skills including     > communication and collaboration are less researched, and     > cultural-historical perspectives barely mentioned.

-   As such, this literature review widened to include broader contexts     > of digital making, an informal STEM making and tinkering.

### 

### Learning Dimensions - Collaboration and Choice (perhaps Autonomy)

### **Defining terms**

-   Make explicit broad definition of social dimensions of learning that     > are present in concept 21^st^ C skills (Binkley et al., 2012),     > which have been linked to game making (Bermingham et al., 2013).

-   This study narrows the focus to collaboration and decision making.

-   Collaboration around projects and problems can broken down further     > from wide participation to a narrow joint focus on *Joint Problem     > Spaces* (Dillenbourg, 1999; Jordan, 2004; Roschelle and     > Teasley, 1995)

-   Choice, autonomy, control, -- broad definition -- as foundational to     > constructivist approaches . then within a particular domain, ie     > project based learning (Blumenfeld et al., 1991), or radical /     > home education, see Neill (Summerhill), Holt, free choice / STEM     > environments (Falk et al., 2006)

**Concepts important to educational settings for** **choice and collaboration**

**WHY -** Outline concepts of choice and collaboration from different schools cognitive background and more ecological background. Coming from more social naturalistic however, cognitive school useful as more interventionist by nature, which helps my intervention -- I'll bring them together at end.

-   Roschelle and Teasley (1995) also talk of the importance of     > negotiated meanings and repairs in understandings in analysis of     > dyad problem solving . Compare 'repairs' in meaning in R and T /     > Dillenbourg, to conflicts and tensions in AT.

-   From this I propose, collaboration in problems solving is more     > realistic when choice is present and therefore genuine negotiation     > can take place. Supported by Choice as motivation (Deci and Ryan,     > 2000; Evans and Boucher, 2015),

-   Rogoff (1994) in her development of the concept of communities of     > learners, stresses importance of participant (especially parents)     > shifting perspective of their participation in learning.

-   Value of play to create shared understandings SST, and ZoP

-   Scaffolding -- design needed to help the process of collaboration,     > this can be explored in context of PBL also.

-   Ill structured problems -- thus inviting diverse solutions (Savery,     > 2006; Savery and Duffy, 1995).

-   Student Centred Leaning -- and concepts which support this,     > autonomy, choice and control -- big in e learning, and     > instructional design

-   Autonomy includes ideas of self evaluation, which is increasing     > valued in my design, in development of feedback sessions and an     > online project log.

**LINK --** Ultimately, while this section is on social approaches and factors to learning, there is tension surrounding conceptions of personal learning that must be addressed. The focus of this study is on language use, shared meaning and learning of digital making and coding practices. These are processes that the individual is involved in learning. Contrast constructivist notion of personal learning as transmission with that of Rogoff's understanding of appropriation of practices in-situ.

If practices need to be studied in context then the conventions, tools and concepts of different elements of my design are important to explore in enough depth for a non-expert reader to understand.

### **Exploration of Study Design Elements of my Intervention**

**Short description:** My learning design is a playful project-based approach to web game making / modding using code playgrounds in a non-formal setting. I created a Code Playground game which acts as a template for users to remix, they are then able

-   The areas of informal / non-formal learning are researched but     > coverage is patchy and definitions not well established

-   Thus give working definitions of informal and non-formal (European     > Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, 2009). In short     > informal is without structure (e.g. Communities of Practice),     > non-formal is structured but out of formal settings (e.g ) .

This study assumes no specialised knowledge of these areas thus relevant contextual factors to outline are:

-   background experience of digital game playing, and wider discorses     > that family bring to the process

-   characteristics of non-formal, third space learning (contrasted with     > formal and totally unstructured learing)

-   value of project-based approaches and playful elements like ARGs and     > Mantle of Expert

-   game making and modding as an educational practices, particularly in     > non-formal settings,

-   characteristics of code playgrounds as an educational tool for     > coding and multimedia remixing

**\ LINK** - I have selected contextual factors which have informed my choice of design, which will impact on or which have potential to illuminate the analysis of results. For some of these sections, eg - family, game making, it is clear why an overview of research concepts is needed, for others -- including playful project approaches and collaborative production in playgrounds -- my justification fro in will be explored.

Concepts here normally emerge from empirical studies, however there is not space to go into detail, inclusion here indicates that I think they are valid unless otherwise stated.

### Family, Professional Contexts & Media Literacy

-   From earlier ecological approach to research and our understandings     > of the learning happening from Rogoff, for this study wider     > ecologies of interest are digital family learning in the home,     > retro game playing and wider game making communities of indy     > games. Livingstone here?

-   Media literacy studies, Burn, Gee, Jenkins, a wide spectrum of     > digital fluency. Gee's affinity spaces could be seen as     > non-formal, as designed spaces compared to more chaotic     > Participatory Culture

<!-- -->

-   a factor that may help recruitment are the incorporation of the     > video game console back into family life in response to     > fragmentation (Chambers, 2012). video game play seen as positive     > for communication bringing families closer together (Itō et al.,     > 2010).

-   Ito describes a spectrum from participation to to creative     > production and sees the family environment as a suitable spaces     > for exploratory messing around (Itō, 2009, p. 44)

### Non Formal Dimensions 

-   Examples of non-formal spaces for making coder dojo (Sheridan et     > al., 2016).

-   In the same area of museum learning the contextual model draws on     > past experience of learners and mentions the importance of a     > free-choice environment (Falk and Storksdieck, 2005).

-   Explore the challenge of creating a learning community which brings     > elements of the informal, ecological into a new environment     > (Linehan and McCarthy, 2001).

-   Similar challenge faced by museums and informal learning spaces     > wanting to design for choice and draw on family experiences     > (Crowley and Jacobs, 2002; Petrich et al., 2013) as funds of     > knowledge (Moll et al., 1992).

-   Roque drawing on Barron facilitation styles

-   Parental facilitation roles are also explored as one of the     > influences of cultural expectations are explored by Siyahhan and     > colleagues in a study which used Activity Theory as a framework     > for to analyse family learning in digital game playing (Siyahhan     > et al., 2010).

-   Hypertext and hyper media as learning environments providing choice     > and control as an aid not just to motivation but 'deeper     > processing of information presented' (Patterson, 2000; Scheiter     > and Gerjets, 2007) .

### Playful Project Approaches 

-   Summary of Project based approaches, especially in relation to     > collaboration and autonomy.

-   Informal design lends to soft rather than hard scaffolding, however     > there are approaches used in non-formal settings which have harder     > scaffolding like Mantle of the Expert, or ARG (Whitton Mossley)     > (Heathcote)

-   **WHY?** -- These elements narrow the gap of an educational     > intervention and genuinely authentic contexts. In this case     > providing scaffolding tools for participants to engage in     > dialogue.

### Game Design, Modding and Digital Making

-   Revisit summary information on dimensions of learning in research of     > game making.

-   Make distinct, practice of modding, remixing, fixing half-baked     > games. (Gee and Tran, 2016; Grizioti and Kynigos, 2018; Kynigos     > and Yiannoutsou, 2018)

-   Remixing as practice rather than the abstract, professional     > reference of plumbing rather than architecting, and then concrete     > vs abstract approaches (Papert and Turkle, 1990).

### Collaborative Production and Code Playgrounds

-   Description of code playgrounds for collaborative real time coding     > on the web (Fiala et al., 2016).

-   Place within framework of collaborative, open source production,     > FLOSS and version control via git (Dabbish et al., 2012)., and     > emergent use of git for collaboration and version control in     > education (Zagalsky et al., 2015). While this sounds techie, and     > limits were expressed by John Britton, the useability of new tools     > offer tremendous potential

-   Circle back to a more accessible format of glitch.com and my design     > specifics, including diverse web tools, stemming from my my     > participation in teach the web (Mozilla Foundation, 2014;     > Sefton-Green, 2013).

LINK -- Plenty of studies here, but none really go into detail for the kind of digital making via code playgrounds and online tools. This design is unique but the whole area is under researched.

 

### Broad View on Methodology and this Study

-   As reflected in reviews, much of literature on game making has focus     > on personal learning coming from a broadly piagetian     > constructivist background, specifically Papert's constructionism     > (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick,     > 1996).

-   This focus on individual learning is problematic from perspective of     > sociocultural approaches due to x,y,z. (Fosnot, 1993;     > O'loughlin, 1992)

-   To address the broader move, later work from Kafai incorporates     > broader social approaches and attempts to bring them into the     > 'constructionist' fold (Kafai and Burke, 2015). Kafai's work now     > draws on Rogoff's outline of personal, social and community     > learning planes (1993), to evangelise wide-ranging benefits of     > 'constructionist gaming'. Resnick focus in research is the detail     > of design of tools and communities to support project based     > experiential learning. However as neither Resnick or Kafai Both do     > so without re-examining the underlying legacy of Papert and thus     > Piaget's influence. Constructionism is a starting influence but     > not an ideal framework for holistic analysis.

-   Thus, Constructionism seems of little utility as either an     > underlying theoretical framework or as a applied, analytical     > framework. We return to this later to justify AT as an analytical     > framework for this study.

-   Other candidates for include, participatory design, ethnography,     > communities of practice, mutual appropriation and design     > experiments (Engeström, 2011; Nicolopoulou and Cole, 2009), While     > not fully explored in the scope of this RD2 reasons for choosing     > AT over them will be explored in full study and in passing in     > later section study design elements.

-   Summary of AT, unit of analysis is activity system, thus available     > at different sizes. While key activity system is classroom     > interaction over 6 week, this is of value when exploring the     > following contexts which will influence the narrower design.

    Frameworks and Design Strategies     --------------------------------

In my research, design frameworks have been useful for as a starting point for my design. Also as a possible output of this study will be a modified framework. As this study aims for practical outputs and not to duplicate existing efforts, a review of some candidates of design frameworks is valid. Criteria for selection here are holistic and advanced frameworks for design, and should have relevance my design, which aims to provoke collaboration and autonomy/ choice, through making a text-game involving making of various digital elements including digital art and audio.

-   **Tinkering :** See Resnick and review -- remixing as a basis for my     > design --

-   Bevan and colleagues at the Exploratorium museum in San Fransciso     > have developed a framework which explores social aspects of     > tinkering (Bevan et al., 2015, p. 53; Petrich et al., 2013)     > notably social learning forms a great part of this framework, and     > is thus inspirational for this study.

### **Data Analysis - Activity Theory **

Background of socio-cultural approaches. Engestrom linking US and Russian schools.

Overview of parts of AT and third model

Expansive conception of learning and why particularly suited to this intervention.

As the goals of the individuals and the families involved may change as they deepen their participation in the programme. Or shift in and out of individual focus (creativity), family focus, group focus (advance joint learning of creating a game as a group of learners).

Emerging Description of Results -------------------------------

-   Start off by underlining the emergent nature of the results and even     > the focus of the research based on emergent and evolving nature of     > AT studies (as distinct from some schools of design experiments)     > (Nicolopoulou and Cole, 2009).

-   As such following is promising start of this process

-   Simple analysis of the dyad, and wider interactions via screen and     > audio capture.

-   There is a promise to cross reference this with simple gesture     > analyis.

**Details of the GGC design as AT sketches**

Images looking at the designs and descriptions

**Complications and Tensions in representing the design, **

From Blin on CALL (Blin, 2004), Kutti expresses the difficulty of expressing relationships between activity and IT as it 'penetrates activities at all levels'

**Expansions present in my decisions to create new mediating tools to address tensions identified. **

NOTE -- not sure how to reference back to the context concepts in the light of Collaboration and Choice. Write blog posts and come back to this, but list some underneath.

-   Code Playground Game

-   Quick Tasks from students

-   Book and Code examples

-   Map / Hub page

-   MoE drama

**Result - Emerging importance of Media Literacy and fluency**

Media literacy and digital fluency, much more than computational thinking and competency was not a core part of my goals but it emerged as one of the big outcomes of pilot studies, thus dimensions of media literacy afforded by the design may emerge.
