The foundations of building games through Constructionism =========================================================

[]{#anchor}The key word of constructionism increasing in popularity. Also with game playing and making.

What are underpinning concepts of a constructionist approach to game making.

This writing traces the genesis of the term from in Papert's Mindstorm

then explores the foundations of constructionism in the constructivism of Piaget and the landscape at the time of this formation, linking with foundational concepts in the contemporary cognitive revolution

Then the underpinning concepts of constructionism as a teaching and learning theory.

Then explores other uses in more contemporary studies to test of elaborations or deviations of the term

Make this enough of an intro to Papert to justify the journey back to Piaget ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cognitive Foundations ---------------------

-   Summary of Piaget's constructivism -   Background of Constructivism, interactionism, as base -   Key differences in perspective (end with the celebration on concrete     stage)

Ackermann's exploration of the similarities between constructionism and constructivism places Papert's focus on the way learners identify and accommodate new information thus creating new internal representations of the world.

Overview of Constructionism  ----------------------------

What is is what it is't -- More of a meta theory than a learning theory in itself - Hoban et al., 2010)

Contrasts to pure discovery Kafai, 2014)

Celebrating the Concrete ------------------------

-   Objects to think with -   Bricolage -   Hard and Soft coding approaches.

Papert's interest in the educational value of the production of digital artefacts as objects drove the creation of the LOGO coding language some associated physical tools, notably drawing turtles. For this study Papert's concept of Microworld is of particular interest. Microworlds are designed spaces which act as incubators for certain kinds of learning. His criteria for Microworlds are that they should give examples of the chosen subject learning, bring all needed concepts inside the Microworld and that there should be footholds for the end user to put this kind of learning to use with interaction with the world Papert, 1980, p. 126). It must comply to the learning principle that for a concept to progress beyond making links to your existing knowledge, you must use it, play with it to find out more and assimilate or accommodate your findings into your world view Ackermann, 2001).

Of particular interest to this study are the concept of soft and hard approaches to coding Papert, 1990). Whereas a hard approach infers a top down perspective mirrored by recent conceptions of computational thinking Wing, 2008), soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner directed connection with the materials or digital artefacts involved, a connection evoking Levi Strauss' concept of bricolage 1962).

Physical vs Digital Construction --------------------------------

Change in focus for papert?

Objects that can be shared.

The evolution of practice.

Maker spaces designed to highlight the physical interactions and facilitate peer learning.

Exploring Social aspects of Constructionism -------------------------------------------

Exploring the social --

Social constructivism and constructionism

Ackermann constrasts Papert's more individual approach

Kafai adds in the open windows model

Constructionism and Current Practice ------------------------------------

-   Papert's take in Mindstorm / Children's machine

Resnick et al develop the process of designing a software tool to facilitate a constructivist approach into a framework containing an analogy to building design 2005). Such a tool should have wide walls catering for diverse interests, a low threshold to allow for novices with little technical experience and high ceilings so learners are not restricted by the technical limits of the creative environment as their designs become more complex. * *

*I would develop this more if there were a greater word count to discuss their framework outlined below.\ Immediate Feedback: See the result, see the process\ Fluid Experimentation: Easy to get started, easy to connect,\ Open Exploration: Variety of materials, variety of genres *

Resnick and Rosenbaum also discuss 'tinkering with tinkerability', detailing facilitation guidelines to support the open learning processes. These include; set themes not challenges, highlight diverse examples, tinker with space, encouraging engagement with people, posing questions instead of giving answers and combining diving in with stepping back 2013, pp. 17--19). They identify this as an area for further research.
