#The characteristics and potential of selected digital game making environments

}The starting point of this study is that making computergames has great potential supporting a diverse set of competenciesincluding computational practices, team work, problem solving andcritical thinking. There are exciting models of practice which have attheir core authentic links with real world issues, complex ecologies ofcooperation and accessible tool sets and practices. An open question toset the context could be: *What environments exist to facilitate thelearning the making of games in an authentic context which maximisesstudent control and engagement?*

This opening piece examines some of the the overlapping concepts,environments and processes related to this area of interest rather thanspecifics of the tools involved. Due to a wide focus the aim is more acataloguing than in depth contrasting, however some attempts are made ingrouping and linking related concepts.

When discussing digital game making here, a wide definition is usedincluding, creating original games, video game level modding, sand-boxgames and hardware digital game hybrids. Indeed, as Buckingham and Bumpoint out (2015)the difference between making, playing and modding games is oftenblurred.

The Constructionist school and the legacy of LOGO

Papert's interest in the educational value of the production of digitalartefacts as objects drove the creation of the LOGO coding language andassociated physical tools including drawing turtles. Many early studiesin the creation of digital games use LOGO as their base.

For this study Papert's concept of Microworld is of particularintersest. Microworlds are designed spaces which act as incubators forcertain kinds of learning. His criteria for microworld are that theyshould give examples of the chosen subject learning, bring all neededconcepts inside the microworld and that there are footholds for the enduser to put this kind of learing to use with interaction with the worldPapert,1980, p. 126). Eg the turtle?

It must comply to the what Papert sees as a common sense learningprinciple that to progress beyond making links to your existingknowledge you must use it, play with it to find out more and assimilateor accommodate your findings into your world viewAckermann,2001). Ackermann's exploration of the similarities betweenconstructionism and constructivism places Papert's focus on the waylearners identify and accommodate new information creating new internalrepresentations of the world.

A significant output of this lineage is the Scratch visual coding tooland community. The pedagogical underpinning of the Scratch project is areframing of the contructionist method in this context as softwaretinkeringMaloneyet al., 2010; Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013). Some of the key learningconcepts valued are; a playful and iterative approach, visual methodsusing code blocks, the ability to easily revise aims and a 'bottom-up'construction process where small clusters of code blocks are rapidlybuilt, tested and can then be combined in to larger code structures.Coding concepts are said to discovered through exploration.\

Resnick et al develop the process of designing a software tool tofacilitate such a constructivist approach into a framework with analogyto construction.2005).It should have wide walls catering for diverse interests, a lowthreshold to allow for novices with little experience and high ceilingsso learners are not restricted by the limits of the creative environmentas the progress.

We can see that certain of these design principles could also be appliedto a wider learning environment. Others include

Resnick and Rosenbaum discuss tinkering with tinkerability as a way togive general guidelines to support the open learning processes theyvalue including: set themes not challenges, highlight diverse examples,tinker with space, encouraging engagement with people, posing questionsinstead of giving answers and combining diving in with stepping back2013).The final phrase highlights the importance of learner reflection.

Physical Tinkering and Making Environments

[]{#anchor-1}Tinkering with physical objects, link with maker movementbut note limits of the kit / jigsaw approaches, instead look atExploratoriumframeworkBevanet al., 2015)

There are clear differences between the open-ended approach to apallette of objects which can be recombined flexibily from made to themeasure maker kits that come with a set of instructions which havebecome one output of the Maker movement. The rigorous reproduction ofthe picture on the box detract from the problem solving and designchallenges latent in the materials.

Many making advocates would perhaps discourage such a reverent approachto the goal of such kits and could comment that the original designexists only as a starting point to be torn apart on and rebuild incombination with similar materials. How much this actually happens maybe dependent on the culture in which kits are assembled.

Accelerated Creative Processes and Game Jams

Game Jams and Hackathons are a form of accelerated production processthat has simlararities to code sprints.

While Game Jams in the strictest definition fall into the acceleratedproduction process, many Jams find ways to take pressure from theprocess.

Stressing there is no right way to do a jam.

The process for creating teams is varied including the socialistprocess.

Challenge and brief

\**Conclusion and areas for future development **

This writing has addressed some of the key pedagogical approaches andlearning environments common in the teaching of web game making andcreating of game making communities. During the course of this researchother factors have come to focus as having potential significance.

While this study too a wide definition of what it meant to make digitalgames, a more thourough investigation of the variety of methods ofcreation, modification and customisation of games.

This area would suit a concurrent examination of the possibilities anddrawbacks of the game making software or frameworks involved.

The low cost nature of developing in a browser and the alternative usesof the web technologies sued may address concerns of the cost of toolsand the time involved in learning game making environmentWhitton,2012).

The research brought up memories for me of different tech environmentsthat I have been involved in where the way we arranged our processhelped draw people into our world. Specifically, playing withpreconceptions and creating unexpected working situations. A highlightwere rural media labs at protest camps where a disparate group ofvolunteers brought various hi-tech but low-cost equipment assembled in afraying army tent. As your eyes adjusted to the gloom upon entry, youwould be greated with the sight of leds, and strewn power and cat 5cables snaking back to a wind generator and satellite connection diskmounted on haybales at the back of the tent.
