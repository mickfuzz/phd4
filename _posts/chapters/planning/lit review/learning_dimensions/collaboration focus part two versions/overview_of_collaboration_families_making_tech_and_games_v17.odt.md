Overview of Collaboration and Family Learning Making  =====================================================

Background and Introduction  ----------------------------

The focus of this study is on collaborative production in family learning environments. I plan to approach it from constructivist, sociocultural perspectives. I am keen to involved, playful use of games and accessible construction materials to aid the creative process, lowering barriers to participation and help build confidence develop the identities of participant as makers and creators. The interaction between physical and digital aspects of the making processes is of great interest to me.

This writing aims to problematise definitions of collaboration, to describe methods of studies on collaborative production and discuss resulting outcomes. Due to the wide range of contexts and methods covered this writing is only able to touch on underlying difference in methodologies briefly in the conclusion.

On Collaboration ----------------

The research around collaborative processes and digital game making for learning is limited Earp, 2015; Kafai and Burke, 2015). Earp and colleagues note 'analysis of collaboration is mainly restricted to peer review and providing feedback' 2013, p. 2), with the focus of most studies being on learner attitudes, subject knowledge or skill acquisition Bermingham et al., 2013). As a practical response, this writing widens in focus to include the related fields of pair programming, creative computing, physical making and tinkering and intergenerational participatory design.

A common theme associated with game making programmes is that they support the development of 21^st^ Century Skills. Definitions of 21^st^ Century Skills vary widely Binkley et al., 2009). In an analysis of wider frameworks Voogt and Roblin, 2012), twenty first century skills have been summarised as collaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social/cultural skills & citizenship, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and productivity. As these terms are complex and complementary Kickmeier-Rust and Albert, 2012), I will explore the term collaboration, to better situate particular aspects of collaboration most relevant to this study.

A broad conception of collaboration is shared by Resnick in the context of creation of online coding projects 2007). He references the concept of Participatory Culture advanced by Jenkins where people share a wide variety of created or appropriated digital artefacts in a interest-driven community. Participants are often fans sharing work using various forms of internet platforms. These are most commonly specific sharing and social media sites including YouTube, Flickr and Facebook. Here work is viewed by other users, often forming the basis for comments and conversations. In the context of sharing media and games, the result is participation in a 'collaborative community' 2007, p. 4), where users can borrow and build upon the work of others.

In a review of research on group work Cohen, 1994), collaboration is seen as a desirable, social outcome. The author notes that effective learning designs are needed to prevent work which could be done individually being assigned to a group, suggesting that ineffective interventions change little but the seating arrangement. She advocates the use of 'ill-structured tasks' 1994, p. 4), which have many possible solutions as a way to ensure effective team working.

The field of computer enhanced learning has explored collaborative learning in depth. This is partly as a response to the danger that computer technology may individualise learning, thus cutting learners off from valuable group insights Stahl et al., 2014). Dillenbourg compares cooperation and collaboration, seeing cooperation as a jigsaw activity where individuals take on parts of a larger task and work on them individually. He compares this to collaboration where the tasks are taken on together, at the same time (synchronously) Dillenbourg, 1999).

In cooperation, partners split the work, solve sub-tasks individually and then assemble the partial results into the final output. In collaboration, partners do the work 'together.' (p. 8)

Rochelle and Teasley make a similar distinction between cooperation and collaboration and explore processes involved in face-to-face collaboration where learners are undertaking joint problem solving involving computers 1995). They hold that collaboration involves a co-construction of knowledge. Their work focuses on the use of language and other artefacts to both enable problem solving and use negotiating strategies to maintain a 'Joint Problem Space' 1995, p. 70). The researchers attach a great deal of importance to the processes needed to maintain this shared understanding of the problem at hand, holding this to be a key aspect of collaboration.

In the descriptions above we can see a narrowing of focus from a very broad view of collaboration as participation in a community, to undertaking different parts of the same project, to synchronous, active work to maintain a shared understanding of the problem at hand. These variances in the interpretations of the term collaboration, while brief, provide a base for analysis of studies of areas of practice.

Capturing Pair and Peer Programming  ------------------------------------

While pair programming - using of peer feedback to improve results -- originated in commercial applications, the concept has also been applied in an educational setting. While many studies on pair programming compare it to individual study through statistical analysis of academic outcomes McDowell et al., 2002; Mullins et al., 2011; Nagappan et al., 2003), fewer exist which capture the processes of collaboration. Denner, Werner and colleagues undertook two studies on pair programming as a social intervention in middle school using the Flash multimedia and Storytelling Alice tool Denner and Werner, 2007; Werner et al., 2013, 2009). The later study used statistical analysis of dyad interaction over time across multiple time points Werner et al., 2013, p. 4). The results find computer confidence to be the most significant factor in the improvement in programming knowledge, outweighing the effects of difference in previous knowledge of the software used and friendship factors.

More relevant to this exploration of collaboration, the earlier study examined student interaction via student journal entires and audiotape transcriptions of dialogue between partners. In journals students were asked to reflect on how they solved problems. Audio tape transcripts were analysed to identify patterns of pair interactions. Emerging patterns include; problem identification and debugging (showing the need to agree on a shared understanding of the nature of the problem), resource signposting and finally the value of pairwork to explore the differences between working code and non-working examples Denner and Werner, 2007, p. 146). Results found that the pair interactions were are times problematic leading to frustration if partners did not interact well, but conversely noted strategies of 'playful interaction' to mitigate frustrations Denner, 2007).

Ching and Kafai 2008) undertook an ambitious study on peer interactions in environmental simulation creation by elementary children using the programming language Logo. They developed a model to allow a richer description of helping activities, particularly those of collaborative work and peer guidance. Their framework describing collaborative mentoring roles was created based on video and audio recording of interactions between teams of forth graders who were tasked with creating simulations and fifth graders tasked to support others students. It describes group organisation, initiation processes and specific help strategies used.

Group organisation of the teams involved is characterised as being mainly either *clustered* around one computer with teams communicating intensively about the same problem, or as *independent* with students working on different aspects of the group task. Hence, following Dillenbourg 1999) clustered work would be characterised as collaboration and independent work as cooperation. However Kafai and Ching note the on-going importance of communication between independent workers. They often worked within earshot and also shared computers at key moments. This complicates the previously explored distinction between cooperation and collaboration, as - although working separately - team members maintain a line of intermittent synchronous communication and to support evolving joint understandings of the emerging problems at hand.

Figure.2 below shows a top tier of how teams configured themselves and a middle teir consisting of how interactions between four and fifth graders came about. Interactions are started in three ways; periodic monitoring by fifth graders, responding to questions asked by four graders or immediate intervention by fifth graders when problems are identified. Finally the bottom tier characterises the nature of the helping strategies of the fifth graders consisting of; suggestions to enable new directions of work, dialogue to aid learner understanding, direction based on interaction and direct intervention to fixing code problems.

Specifically, what is the thinking of older students when choosing helping strategies, and how (and if) to support and scaffold the development of those processes to help both sets of learners.

The authors advocate this approach or peer interaction as a tactical response to the often intensive demands on teacher time when classes are engaged in coding tasks. They note the potential to turn to apprenticeship and community of practice approaches Rogoff, 1993; Wenger, 1998) to better investigate those questions. Their strategies to overcome acknowledged difficulties of engendering communities of practices in a formal education setting Lave and Wenger, 1991; Linehan and McCarthy, 2001) - particularly those which deal with the formation of identities within communities, authentic patterns of collaboration, and retransmission of behaviours -- are well articulated and persuasive.

Creative Computing and Digital Creativity -----------------------------------------

In this context Creative Computing is a broad term for the user of accessible tools and practices for making diverse artefacts with multimedia software using programming. Similar related terms exist including digital creativity and digital making Sefton-Green, 2013). The term Creative Computing is particularly favoured by a school of researches and designers clustered around the MIT Media Lab and their work stemming from pioneering work on the LOGO programming language by Seymour Papert 1980).

One of this teams most visible and researched tool is Scratch. Scratch is free desktop and web software used to support coding of games and other media projects. It uses coloured code blocks rather than a text based approach, allows incorporation of a wide variety of media and has an online community for sharing created works. It is productive to look at some of the research and researchers that make up the Scratch community as a way of exploring some of perspectives concerning collaboration in this area.

Resnick explores Scratch as a tool allowing the sharing of user created artefacts 2007). A Scratch creation is open by default, allowing other users of the site to click on a *See Inside* button to view the code blocks used to construct it. Resnick highlights the collaborative potential offered by the Scratch toolset, specifically, the abilities to remix programmable media, to form production teams, and give each other feedback. Much of Resnick's work focuses on design and technical considerations to lower the barriers to engage in programming Resnick et al., 2009, 2005; Resnick and Silverman, 2005). When he directly addresses the perspective of users, their experience is outlined using individual, anecdotal evidence Brennan et al., 2010; Resnick, 2012). As one of the designers and enthusiastic advocate of Scratch as a tool, we can assume that Resnick is choosing user stories in an unrepresentative way to highlight particular possibilities offered by design choices. Indeed, Sefton-Green points out that one of the limitations of studies in this field is that they tend towards to detail 'exceptionalist' 2013, p. 8) rather than ordinary use, making disinterested evaluation difficult.

However, in addition to this focus on design and individual use, many other studies detailed more applied and social uses of Scratch in context exist. Indeed more extensive and complimentary studies focusing on user collaboration in the online Scratch community have been carried out by Resnick's colleagues Fields et al., 2014, 2013; Hill and Monroy-Hernandez, 2013; Roque et al., 2012). A study by Roque and colleagues details pro-active members of the Scratch community engaging in collaborative work 2012). The authors describe the range of sophisticated technical and social processes that new users need to juggle in order to be an active member of collaborative Scratch projects. However, examination of log files on the platform's server show that only a small minority of users are involved in such collaborative processes Fields et al., 2014). To counter this disparity of use Roque and colleagues have explored strategies around the creation of learning designs and supportive peer structures. Specifically the use of coding events, competitions and the development of other social processes to scaffold collaboration within the online community 2016b). Indeed, creative competitions and events are a common strategy in this field to transcend and a focus on individual learning are Sefton-Green, 2013).

Beyond this focus on online support, and with a mind to the problems of inequality of access to such a participatory culture Itō et al., 2010), Roque later researched facilitated creative processes in out-of-school, family learning settings 2016). The programme in question - Family Creative Learning (FCL)-- had the explicit goal to allow parents to explore supportive roles in a creative digital environment. It drew on the technical capability of Scratch to allow users to incorporate diverse media materials into creations and thus make them personally meaningful, consequently increasing motivation and identification with the process. In two iterations of a four session programme, Parents and children used of physical computing tools - including the easy to use sensor kit Makey Makey and non-digital materials and activities - to lower barriers to participation and to build collaborative capacities of learners before non familiar digital task. The use of non-digital activities, crafting activities saw parents to connect to previous competencies and identities in a way that reduced anxiety surrounding working with new technologies. In addition such activities helped make coding processes concrete for participants facilitating the construction of shared language and understandings.

Data collection comprised video data of interactions, facilitator field notes and interviews with participants and facilitators. This study is significant as the level of detail that parents, children and facilitators were able to share in interviews and the triangulation possible with video recording and field notes allow for a richer interpretation of learning experience thatn that offered by case studies focused around artefacts offered in other Scratch studies Resnick, 2012). The experience of young people, parents and facilitators was analysed using Barron's framework of parental roles to support learning with technology 2009). Significal behaviours identified in parents included, collaborating with children, learning from children, brokering other learning opportunities, providing non-technical support and access to technical resources. The adoption of parental roles was observed as being as temporary, with participants shifting between them and moving into new roles over the course of programme 2016a).

In what seems to have been an unexpected turn in the research, attention was then focused on the roles of volunteer facilitators. In on-going group discussions with parents, facilitators began to explicitly encourage effective helping behaviours in parents and thus further enabling both their reflection on their helping roles and for them to gain insight into other parents' approaches. Subsequent interviews with volunteer facilitators proved useful to explore their support of the development of parent-child interactions Roque and Jain, 2018). Volunteer Maria noted the importance of modelling a tinkerers mindset to families (a concept explored later). Sam noted his development of a sense of the balance between over and under facilitation. Alex felt validated in making positive and constructive additions to a particular families 'learning dynamic' facilitated by previous relationship building involving learning about participants interests and drivers 2018, p. 6).

The researchers saw great value in the work of facilitators to identify, praise and therefore encourage various roles. While it may be tempting to structure, formalise and instruct participants on idealised roles of collaboration - a process favoured by strategies such as reciprocal teaching Palinscar and Brown, 1984) -- the authors resist such conclusions. They instead place great stock in the intuitive and evolving responses of parents and facilitators, indeed suggesting the tactic of 'facilitate the facilitators' rather than instruction on how to guide participant interaction 2018, p. 8). This approach is in line with Dillenboug who points out that overly prescriptive approaches remove the valuable -- indeed he would argue intrinsic - aspect of negotiating roles from the collaborative process 1999).

One self-reported limitation of the study is that the parents involved all had at least one parent who had a positive predisposition to the use of technologies for creative purposes. In addition to this, the high level of support from a large team of facilitators in the process and low participant numbers may make this a difficult programme to scale up and roll out.

Tinkering & Making in Makerspaces ---------------------------------

I want to acknowledge the complexities involved in the terms *making* and *tinkering* associated with the Maker Movement Vossoughi and Bevan, 2015). However for the purposes of this writing I use a broad definition of them as the making and sharing physical objects as a non-professional activity.

Making and tinkering are popular in the context of informal and youth oriented exploration of STEM content material and contexts such as science museums. Crowley and Brahms describe museum making spaces as distinct from traditional interactive exhibits in their use of real tools, diverse loose parts materials and presence of skilled facilitators 2016). The authors acknowledge established frameworks of design principles that attract, hold and communicate to families in museums Borun and Dritsas, 1997) but contend that they should be expanded to encompass the complex processes occurring between families and facilitators over time in museum maker spaces. The authors underline the need to expand the unit of time observed when researching of the kind of learning happening here. The research methods they use reflect this focus. Through the use of in-depth case studies involving extensive documentation and semi-structured interviews with young visitors and their family members they focus on the trajectory of learners over many visits.

In their review of tinkering and making, Vossoughi and Bevan explore tensions and aspirations surrounding use of materials 2015). Materials and tools should lower barriers to entry for participants yet not be too limiting technically. They should provide immediate feedback and allow exploration of a wide range of genres of created artefacts. These material affordances of making spaces allow participants to jump right into immediate tinkering constructing and elaborating prototypes with no formal needs analysis of the product. Here there are strong synergies with Papert's influence on Creative Coding approaches, namely a rejection of the primacy of abstracted designs and planned approaches and focus on welcoming 'softer', more personalised and exploratory approaches to coding 1990, p. 168).

Bevan and colleagues at the Exploratorium museum in San Fransciso have developed a framework which explores social aspects of tinkering Bevan et al., 2015). The framework is a product of in-depth analysis of video recordings and conversations between participants and facilitators as they interact with tinkering museum exhibits. Of the four categories identified in their learning dimensions framework, while only one, social scaffolding, explicitly explores collaboration as a outcome of the process, the others - engagement, initiative and dimensions of understanding - are all measured in the context of communication happening in the context of collaborative activities. As such, the indicators used to locate the learning dimensions are social rather than cognitive in focus, drawing on Vygotskian concepts of expansive conceptions of learning which the authors describe as moving 'beyond tradition school-like conceptions (knowing), beyond traditional constructivist conceptions (doing), to include conceptions of the socially and situated developing self (being and becoming)' 2013, p. 53). We can contrast this process-driven approach with a more commercial dimension of the Maker Movement which places greater emphasis on instructional kit assembly approaches. Blikstein characterises this as repetitive making based on preset instructions, asserting that this tendency towards 'trivial' fabrication fails to exploit potential problem solving and design challenges latent in the materials 2013, p. 8).

Bevan and Vossoughi explore the issue of the embedded values surrounding making 2015). They identify diverse agendas for making programmes, with some driven by a to support generall STEM learning, others rooted in a progressive empowerment agenda and still others oriented towards military recruitment Vossoughi and Vakil, 2018). They caution that concepts of 'innovation' and 'global competitiveness' 2015, p. 40) are often adopted into STEM programmes as uncontroversial tropes favourable to economic development, suggesting that an unproblematic embrace of such values does not serve the greater potential of making programmes to explore important political concerns surrounding technology. Other researchers highlight the prevalence of white men and boys in the literature and narratives of the maker movement as a potential barrier to the broader participations of minority groups in making spaces Grenzfurthner and Schneider, 2009; Halverson and Sheridan, 2014).

Participatory Design & Collaborative Inquiry --------------------------------------------

In this section I compare the immediacy of previously described approaches to the more context oriented approach of more traditional design methods. The design process has many interpretations however common themes include; ideation techniques, the importance of gathering user requirements, iterative approaches, the use of physical or testable prototypes and the integration of user testing to inform improvements Flanagan et al., 2005; Scaife and Rogers, 1999). Participatory Design (PD) involves users extensively in ideation and planning stages and involves techniques to make the values present in the design process and product explicit Schuler and Namioka, 1993). While the majority of PD methods are aimed at commercial products or public services, the exploration of values, empathy, and user experience is also suited to improving educational designs and technologies Bonsignore et al., 2013).

Collaborative Inquiry (CI) is an adapted thread of PD focused on the specific context of the co-creation of children's technologies Druin, 1999; Guha et al., 2013; Yip et al., 2013). It comprises three key aspects; a close research partnership with children, use of naturalistic methods to gather contextual data in-situ and the use of low-tech, craft based prototyping techniques - as in PD - to help intergenerational participants communicate new ideas on a level playing field Druin, 1999). A common PD concern is that participants often struggle to articulate their needs in the process of design Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1997). A response of CI is to have at least some of the young people involved in the process to have already built competencies in the design processes through being involved in previous CI projects 2013).

Uchidiuno and colleagues used CI to develop technology to help STEM learning in informal family settings via the creation of the Science Everywhere application Uchidiuno et al., 2017). In prototyping sessions they used extensive video recordings, participant observation via note taking and post-session ,semi-structured interview with participants. The results highlight the role of an empathising process to open productive explorations of the context of the family learning environment and the value of offering guidance - particularly to parents - to help them adopt collaborative roles and thus engender equal participation. They also found the iteration process of the design surfaced patterns which helped to build knowledge of family learning roles and increase the bi-directional nature of helping relationships. In this last respect, strong synergies with the FCL programme described above are evident.

Discussion ----------

Emphasis of Tools over Processes

There is a notable trajectory in the research describing creative computing and physical making activities. Initial research and associated literature often focuses on design aspects and the affordances of construction toolsets. The tone is positivistic in that the tools are often presented as fun keys to unlock the STEM knowledge needed in technology focused workplaces. However later studies described above reach a broad consensus that a strategy, which primarily focuses physical toolset and software tools is not optimal. Martin sees as 'fatally flawed' 2015, p. 37) tendencies in the Maker Movement to foreground tools rather than more holistic processes and identity development. This holds even when the potential of tools is expressly creative and social (as in the online Scratch community). Both the value of deeper participation in online making communities and the challenges associated with them are explored by many of the researchers above. Kafai noted her own surprise at the scant interset shown by their young game makers in the creations of others in the online community they were using 2016). Martin flags the danger of tools being simplistically incorporated school curriculums in particular, noting that this pattern reflects Cuban's 2003) critique of the simplistic introduction of other technology into schools.

It would be incomplete to present the tension between individual / de-contextualised and social approaches in these fields as resolved. As explored above, there are numerous political and economic factors which are at play here -- including the commercial goals of publishers of making literature Vossoughi et al., 2016) and discourse around digital skills shortages The Royal Society, 2012) -- whose auto-didactic or instructional narratives militate the impact of much of the research above.

**Scaling of Collaborative Roles and Processes**

Sefton-Green's concern about exceptionalist case studies in digital making, and thus scalability of making processes, is underscored by in-depth studies on informal, digital communities Itō et al., 2010). Ito and colleagues note that generative activities (compared to more social interactions) are the exception rather than norm even in expressly creative communities. We have seen that productive partnerships in Scratch are extremely rare compared to false starts Kafai et al., 2016), and studies of the New Grounds site -- which has a similar aim of creating media collaborations -- showed a 80 percent failure rate of collaborative projects Luther et al., 2010). To counter such tendencies, Roque makes a convincing case for the unpicking and facilitating the supportive and collaborative roles that parents and facilitators can play in a family learning context. However, while the design of the FCL programme was effective to build family confidence and increase overall accessibility of making and coding, it left questions about the effectiveness of the process to enable learning at home. Many participants did not persue creative making activities outside of the programme, leaving the possibilities of their new maker identity behind and returning to the 'old, old me' 2016, p. 121).

The tension between autonomous participation in a naturalistic setting or structured, facilitated support is one explored in the extensive literature on project based approaches. Advocates of project approaches promote the value of open-ended, authentic projects while critics highlight that without support that collaboration is difficult between learners and thus needs to be scaffolded with structured activities and taught input, Kirschner et al., 2006; Kollar et al., 2006). I mention this as the literature surrounding the mature field of Project Based Learning may be a good source of inspiration for tactics to address issues of scaling and replicability of game making education projects.

These tensions are particularly prevalent when trying to bring open-ended practices into formal setting. My own observations of the use of Scratch in school are that students are often asked to follow instructions on worksheets -- as individuals -- to recreate a pre-written game, a far cry from prominent, inspirational case studies. Ching and Kafai's study detailing an emergent peer pedagogy -- while accepting some of the limits school imposes -- identifies the promise of pragmatic community learning practices adapted to the setting 2008). While the focus of my study will be on family learning, outcomes will hopefully be of relevance to issues of collaboration and creative community formation in school settings.

**Future Directions**

Earp and team found that few studies on game making evaluated creativity and collaboration even when students took part in co-production processes involving creative thinking 2013). The authors conclude that research methods to assess creativity and collaboration in the field of game making are lacking despite the very nature of diverse roles involved -- i.e. programming, art creation, music and sound production and game design itself -- making game creation inherently cooperative. The studies in the main body of this writing draw on related fields of study to explore methods and frameworks which I would strongly argue are directly relevant to the area of game making. In this final section I look at some possible directions of interest and potential next steps for my study.

It is worth observing briefly that the general direction of travel on all of the areas above is from a focus on more personal conceptions of knowledge towards more socio-cultural understandings. However, for some theorists the focus on the motivational factors of the sharing created artefacts in communities could still said to be key to personal view of learning Fosnot, 1993). Inherent to this view is a key tension in Constructivist theory between Fosnot's piagetian focus on the value of sharing artefacts as active representation of personal cognitive development and the more socio-cultural focus on the ongoing transmission and negotiation of meaning and values through social processes and tools over time O'loughlin, 1992). More detail on this is beyond the remit of this piece but worth exploring in other writing.

In recent years online tools and processes have evolved which facilitate collaboration in the kind of Joint Problem Space described earlier. Examples of tools and processes that successfully manage this type of asynchronous but complexly mediated collaboration on specific tasks are; online tools and communities for collaborative writing Forte and Bruckman, 2007), using a wiki to develop language skills Kessler and Bikowski, 2010), and the use of distributed code authoring tools to build open source software Dabbish et al., 2012). The educational opportunities offered by the collaborative possibilities online tools provide in more structured learning settings are still in the process of being evaluated Zagalsky et al., 2015). Their distributed and asynchronous nature provide both opportunities and challenges which may be beyond the remit of this study to explore but which I feel provides a lot of potential for future development in my area of interest o collaborative text coding of games with families. While the technologies used could facilitate an interesting study of asynchronous contributions to a text-code game over time, there are some issues. Firstly, my families are likely to be working on their project mostly while in the same physical space. Secondly, online intra-family collaboration outside of the taught sessions would require a high level of learner autonomy Kessler and Bikowski, 2010), which is not predicted or required for participation in the proposed programme.\

Of much greater interest to me is to build on studies where the the value of face-to-face facilitation of family interactions is explored from multiple perspectives using a variety of methods, for example in the work of Roque and Bevan and colleagues described above Bevan et al., 2015; Roque, 2016). One aspect of note about both of these studies is the value placed on the reflections of professional and volunteer facilitators of the family learning process. Since reading these studies I would be keen to consider bringing this perspective into my research.

Some of the studies either explicitly mention activity theory (AT), or clearly reference the surrounding concerns of the importance of community, division of labour and rules of participation Engeström, 1999). I think that AT will be of use in helping me to explore how these learning systems can be set up effectively with diverse families involved. Questions emerging from the research above are; what are points of friction, of harmonising of collaborative processes, where are points of divergence and convergence of goals, identities and in the detail of the work?

The positioning of these interactions as a system is potentially fruitful for a number of reasons. In previous writing, I explored research on the value of game making to engender systems thinking Tekinbaş et al., 2010; Torres, 2009). When examined through the a participatory perspective, I wonder what impact can this emerging knowledge regarding game as systems have on the formation of an emerging system of a community of family game makers? Specifically, is there are positive value in comparing the systems awareness needed to create games with the family as a learning unit. Following the direction of Roque, could making games as a family help families develop their understanding of how they learn together?
