Overview of Family Learning ============================

Working plan Friday for order

-   context of family learning uk, terms, paucity of research-   family learning & literacy & broad definitions of text, start to    explore socio-cultural aspects-   naturalistic studies, media ecologies-   Dual focus interventions around play, at early years-   hybrid approaches, older audiences, game play / making, and cultural    dimensions.

########## Background and Introduction 

The focus of this study is on collaborative production in familylearning environments. I plan to approach it from constructivist,sociocultural perspectives. I am keen to involved, playful use of gamesand accessible construction materials to aid the creative process,lowering barriers to participation and help build confidence develop theidentities of participant as makers and creators. The interactionbetween physical and digital aspects of the making processes is of greatinterest to me.

Introductory Thoughts---------------------

This is a brief look at three key dimensions for family learningrelevant to my study. I look at; the study of the role of games, playand in particular video games in a family context, broad approaches tofamily literacy, and attempts to create more structured learningopporunities to maximise the potential benefits of a familyconfiguration.

To move beyond an exploration of context and case studies, I willunderpin this exploration in the light of a socio-cultural approach.Thus the mechanisms for social exchange and shared construction ofemergent understandings will be highlighted. This is particularlyrelelvant to the area of family learning, as explained by Rogoff

Family Learning Provision-------------------------

The term family learning is problematic in that it can encompass alllearning happening in a home learning environment or on visits outsidethe home with family members or may refer to more formal provision. Inthis section I will use the term FL to indicate more formal provision.

MOVE \_ Interest in the home learning environment is growing as it is arecognised as an important factor in developmental paths of childrenMelhuishet al., 2008).

Family in this context is normally taken to mean one or more familymembers of which one is a child and other fulfilling a parental role,which could be a parent, grandparent, relative or siblingLamb,2009). Recent reviews adopt a similarly broad definition of FL toencompass streams of activities streams of activity are identified asFamily Literacy, Language and Numeracy (FLLN) and Wider Family Learning(WFL), the former focusing on the relevant key skills and the latterfollowing a broader curriculum including creative activities, music, anddigital literaciesBrookset al., 2008; Carpentieri, 2012; Grant, 2009; Lamb, 2009; *Review offamily learning*, 2016). Lamb2009)notes that this categorisation may be seen as more administrative thanpedagogical in nature, citing two relevant funding streams available inthe UK from the Learning Skills Council. Potential outcomes anddimensions of family learning include "progression, self-confidence andself-esteem motivation and self-efficacy aspirations and ambitionsparenting practices, human capital, social and cultural capital"Lamb,2009) ,

Research on the impact of these programmes is limitedBrookset al., 2008; Lamb, 2009; Swain et al., 2014) and mostly focused on theacademic attainment of children related to FLLN programmes. However,broad benefits include parents reporting more confidence in how tosupport their children's learning, indeed that was a greater motivationfor parents than to improve their own skillsSwainet al., 2014).

Play in a Family Learning Context---------------------------------

Needham identifies parent toddler groups, or "stay and play sessions" inthe UK as an under-researched areaNeedham,2011, p. 91). He charts a short history of disparate playing togethersessions with little governmental support before 1997 and a growth ofsupported sessions under New-Labour which develop into increasinglysophisticated pedagogical interventions which encouraged parents toengage and support with their child's play processesAnninget al., n.d.).

An exploration of the terminology of play and games will be exploredelsewhere in my writing. For the purposes of this section play isbroadly considered to be is seen as activities which are voluntary, andplayful in nature in that they are not serious, productive activities. Inote a key distinction is between two key categories of play , epistemic/ exploratory and ludic play which draws on fantasy and symbolic playwith a greater focus on interaction between individualsHutt,1979). This distinction is important as it reflects a broader shift inthe approach of early years literature towards a sociocultural approachto education.

While the EYFS frame work explicitly acknowledges the importance of'sustained shared thinking'Sylvaet al., 2004), there are still many refences to much more individualpractices and learning designs the requirements of the EYFS frameworkand associated literatureNeedham,n.d.). This focus can be attributed to the legacy of the influence onprevious educational policies of a piagetian focus on cognitive progressthrough individual exploratory playSiraj-Blatchford,2004).

Rogoff constest a view of Piaget as play solely focused on individualexploration, but acknowledges that that was how his work was interpretedand translated into policyRogoff,1991). The implication for support of young people in practice is thatadults should take an active role in the facilitation of more social,ludic play forms rather than focusing only on facilitating access tolearning environments and materials that priviledge on more individualexploratory play. Rogoff draws on the work of Vygotskian school ofscholars to help define an approach of guided participation and sharedthinking1998).

Needham and Jackson2014)draw our attention to the desirability for precise definitions in thisdomain of child adult helping strategies, citing attempts by Jordan todifferentiate scaffolding and co-creationJordan,2004) and contrasting them with conceptions of shared thinking.

These points (on practice) are relevant to this exploration of thefactors involving a broad view of family learning in two ways. Firstly awider view of family learning as broadly intergenerational may mirrorjoint working between adults in a more formal setting and thus researchfindings are relevant. Secondly expectations of professionals of howadults can support children's learning may influence those of parentsthey come into contact with and may cause tensions in practiceNeedham,2011).

A key line of research concerning the importance of the home learningenvironment (HLE) is the longitudinal study EPPE (Effective Provision ofPre-school Education) which gathered data of pre-school environment ofyoung people and found that the a stimulating HLE to be the mostsignificant factor in determining progression in cognitive, social andbehavioural skillsEvangelouet al., 2005; Feinstein et al., 2004).

Family Literacy Programmes--------------------------

LINK - A line of research which builds on the possibilities offered bystay and play style sessions is that of the creation of sessions whichbuild family learning.

There has been a relative recent broadening of the research on literacyto include non-school environments and wider conceptions of literacy toinclude non-traditional texts, which may be graffiti, internet chat orcomputer gamesGee,2004; Hull and Schultz, 2001).

A further line of research explores the possibilities for educators todraw on the literacy practices and resources constructed in non-schoolsettings in more traditional settingsMollet al., 1992). Here home culture and competencies related to householdfunctioning or wellbeing are described as 'funds of knowledge'Mollet al., 1992, p. 133). The authors describe how such funds can beleveraged in literacy work in school and after school settings.

Developmental work by Pahl and Kelly2005)explore multimodal texts as a vehicle for family expression in casestudies of joint work in family literacy classrooms. While the authorsacknowledge the value of studies of literacy situated in discrete out ofschools locations and practices, they are guided by the work of Leanderand Sheehy, to evolve beyond situated literacy to explore movementsbetween these sitesLeanderand Sheehy, 2004).

In addition the movement of texts between existing home and schoolsettings, Pahl and Kelly's study investigated the potential foremergent, discursive learning happening. To do this they draw on thework of Moje et al.2004)using third space theory. The integration of funds of knowledge from thefirst space of home environment and more academic discourses of thesecond space of school create a new third space. Moje and colleaguesconvincingly describe the value of third space interventions to buildthe skills of young people to navigate diverse texts and discoures frommultiple funds as preparation

Similarly third spaces more complex exploratoins learner identities andto be more equitable to minority group learnersGutiérrezet al., 2011). The exploration and hybrid approach to literacies here isin line with the sociohistorical importance of culture and an expansiveview of learningEngeström,2001, 1999).

Digital Play and Making in a Family Context-------------------------------------------

This section explores studies which look at learning happening in familyenvironments through more naturalistic studies.

Of particular relavance to my study is the area of digital and media andlearning (DML) bear investigation, as it's diverse but grouped in partby work of MacArthur Foundation.

This section will explore context and then some of the findings of theresearch which may be of relevance to my study.

Context

Blum-Ross and Livingstong locate a history for informal digital trainingin community-based and political training2016).The authors note a move to more individual storytelling, thencreativity, then tech focus of DML, then subsumed by a computingcurriculum focus more in line with hard skills focus of the government.

Wider work on the role of parents in digital environments for kids arein depth and instructive. There are class distinctions about who makesdigital contentLivingstoneet al., 2018)

Findings

Researchers Plowman and colleagues were puzzled at the ways parentsreferred to the processs of younger familiy members 'just picking up'digitalskillsPlowmanet al., 2008).

They also looked to guided participation as a framework to explain thelearning processes occuringRogoffet al., 1993). They note that while explicit teaching is not present,family members are constantly modelling behaviour.

Many studies show parental roles of regulating screen time and otheractivities to negotitate access to digital media are more prevalent thancreative co-useHollingworthet al., 2009). Other studies identify parental anxiety about lack of asa barrier to participation in joint digital activity and conversely therole of children as the technology experts in some householdsCorreaet al., 2015; Roque et al., 2016). Ito explores this as a upsettingcultural norms of parent as expertItō,2009, p. 39).

Intergenerational digital activities are not always presented asproblematic, for example parental involvement in video game play seen aspositive for communication bringing families closer togetherItōet al., 2010).

Ito advances the concept of messing around, and geeking out as aprogression of technical proficiency and creative production.

While not exclusive to a family setting, Ito sees family environment asone of the more suitable spaces for this kinds of more exploratorymessing around to happen, along with friendships groups, interest drivengroups or youth oriented informal programmes, the requiredcharacteristics being the lack of a concrete end goal required by moreformal learning programmesItō,2009, p. 44).

Picking up from previous section, we can see as desireable thepossibility of a READ / Write approach to games and gaming culture toallow for cultural exploration. Gee explores this in affinities ofculture and Jenkins in Participatory Culture. Ito also

It is worth exploring the difference between solo, or freeformexploration of these spaces, and a more scaffolded approach.

Ito and colleagues note that generative activities (compared to moresocial interactions) are the exception rather than norm even inexpressly creative communities.Itōet al., 2010). Sefton-Green shares this concern about exceptionalistcase studies in digital making, and thus scalability of makingprocesses, is underscored by in-depth studies on informal, digitalcommunities. This provides a challenge for educators seeking to harnessthe potenial of 'funds' present in home interactions in a morestructured way.

Family Interactions In facilitated spaces

The value of face-to-face facilitation of family interactions hasexplored from multiple perspectives using a variety of methods, forexample in the work of Roque and Bevan and colleaguesBevanet al., 2015; Roque, 2016).

Some work has been done in the of FL and game making areaOuelletet al., 2017).

AT used a framework for Game Playing Siyahhan et al., 2010). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exploration of Family Themes----------------------------

Livingstone explores the individualisation of the context of communitymedia, and out of school settings provided by extra fundingBlum-Rossand Livingstone, 2016) (explored in Livingstone piece where communitymedia based around social action). She points out that this direction isin keeping with a wider de-contextualisation of learning in schools andthat this trajectory is at odds with the momentum behind contemporaryresearch which emphasises the importance of context in the learningprocess.
