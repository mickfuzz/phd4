Our approach to learning Javascript ====================================

This chapter explains some of the wider learning approaches that arebehind the way this guide is structured. This guide is written in partto act as a support for a family based coding course. So there are someparts of this chapter that might not apply to you if you are not part ofa group learning together. Also there are parts of this chapter thatcould apply to learning any kind of language or complex systems basedactivity.

Hands on, stress free learning------------------------------

The appoach here is learning by doing. From the work of Krashen andother second language learning scholars we are inspired to try to createan atmosphere for learning the Javascript language in an anxiety freeenvironment.

We see playing around with games in a trial and error approach as agreat way to reduce learner anxiety. While the focus of this guide is towork through code examples and to undertake coding challenges, there arealso group activities described which help to introduce concepts to dowith game making and coding in a accessible and non-digital way. Themotivation is to provide a gateway into the culture and language usedfor game making for those who do not feel part of a digital maker orcoding culture.

We can see a parallel in the work done around exploring systems of powerand exploitation in forum theatre in the work of Paolo Freire.

Systems thinking is a part of game making as well as political analysis.Such approaches can be a hard to teach via traditional methods ofinstruction. This approach offers an alternative entry point. Our goalcan be said to be a grounded discussion opportunities on a level playingfield.

Coding first - Concepts later ------------------------------

**Promoting Hands on Tinkering:** From the work of Papert aroundconstructionism other researchers at MIT have developed other tools andprocesses to encourage hands on learning.

We can compare this kind of learning to that of just receivinginformation about coding concetps and step by step instructions. Ideallywe want to promote the idea of hands on coding first and the work outwhat you are doing later to gain underlying knowledge of the codingconcepts involved. However it\'s hard to jump right into tinkering without some instructions to get you started.

To support this approach, the first chapters are arranged so that youcan follow instructions to get a game-like environment up and running inyour web browser as quickly and easily as possible. In followingchapters you are encouraged to play around with the game elements tomake changes.

In addition, we start to address and explore underlying computingconcepts are explained explicitly in the the last part of each chapterin the section **Exploring what this means** ,\<\-- or similar

Browser coding - Fast and familiar----------------------------------

We are making web based games and our approach uses Code Playgrounds -websites that allow you to test web code online - as a learning andteaching environment to make them. This is explained in more detail inthe next chapter.

> Many web developers use something called a code playground to quickly> and easily share a working version of their code as a webpage or part> of a page. Using Code Playgrounds is much easier then having to have> your own webspace. In some ways all code playgrounds are similar. They> let you type in some web code and you can see a preview of the> resulting webpage immediately. This quick feedback is great for> beginner coders. We can see straight away when we have something right> or when we have made a mistake that need correcting.

There are other ways of developing web pages, so what are the pros andcons of this approach?

**Getting up and running quickly:** You can set up a local codingenvironment to code and run your web games but there is quite aninvolved process as in this offical 8 part guide-Â <https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser2/> Avoid such atechnically rigourous process is a tactic to avoid learner anxietymentioned in the previous section. We really don\'t want learners to bethinking \"you know what this just isn\'t for me\".

**Social Learning via sharing and forking of projects: **We can takeadvantage of the tools that make Code Playgrounds popular for webdevelopers to showcase their work.

**Immediate Feedback:** Feedback is key to the learning process, bothfrom other students (as outlined above) but also from the tools used. Inearly work on teaching coding where students issued commands to controla mechanical or screen based Turtle, Papert noted the importance ofvisual feedback in the process to allow students to see what ishappening to an object then can control (Mindstorms).

Our simple coding approach--------------------------

There are many ways of writing Javascript, more so that many languages.In this guide we try to approach writing code using the followingprinciples which we hope will make it easier for beginners to getstarted. Don\'t worry if you are beginning and this part doesn\'t makesense to you. You can skip it and come back to it later. These conceptsare listed here and explained in more details later.

-   **Make Code as Readable as Possible:** Ideally new coders should be    able to look at code examples and understand roughly what is    happening-   **Use Global Variables:** declare variables them at the beginning of    your code before your other game objects-   **Do Repeat Yourself:** this is the opposite of a coding convention    called DRY which stands for Don\'t Repeat Yourself

**Make Code as Readable as Possible**

There are different approaches to make this happen. We are at anadvantage as
