**An overview of literature on Game Making (in educational contexts)**

My proposed study is on the role of collaboration in digital game makingintergenerational learning contexts. While I have chosen to use digitalgames, specifically two-dimensional video games as a learning medium (achoice justified elsewhere in the study), many associated concepts arealso applicable to non-digital games.

As explored in the introductory chapter and previous sections theframeworks of 21^st^ Century skills and Computational Thinking areprevalent in the literature justifying the use of gamemaking ineducation (Brennan and Resnick, 2012; Earp et al., 2012; Grover and Pea,2013; Wing, 2006). Despite a wide diversity in these frameworks andprocesses (see appendix A), key overarching concerns can be identifiedwhich I categorise as; developing critical literacies, creative designmethodologies, game play and mechanics as systems thinking.

**Developing Critical** **Literacies**

Much of the literature exploring literacies and games focuses on theplaying of games, rather than game making. Games are shown to be amedium well suited to the development of active meaning making inkeeping with a constructivist and situated approach to learning (Gee,2003; Jenkins, 2008).

Concerning questions about there being a higher educational potential ofgame making compared to playing, while some authors do claim a greatervalue for game making to address 21^st^ century skills (Earp et al.,2013), other advocates are keen to not prioritise making and thusdevalue playing elements with a false assumption that "to be a fullparticipant, one must also produce."(Salen, 2007, p. 308). I return tothis question later.

Conceptual work that applies the developing multiple literacies wordmissing? applies not just to playing but also making. The work ofBuckingham and Burn on gaming literacies puts social and culturalcontext at heart of the process (2007). In doing so they underline aconcept central to wider understanding of new literacies, that theimportance of critical framing of new knowledge in a way that transcendsfunctional ability (Cope and Kalantzis, 2000).

The positioning of video games and the associated social and technicalcommunication happening around the game as a frame which supports thedevelopment of a meta language is explore by Shaffer and colleagues(Shaffer, 2006; Shaffer et al., 2005). Buckingham and Burn (2007) seepotential problems with the application of existing critical mediatheory to games as is. They identify an over-emphasis on consumption ofmedia rather than its creation stemming from a narrative tradition oftextual analysis. In identifying that games complicate distinctionsbetween making and consuming literacies, their study looks to develop aframework which incorporates game making literacies which includescreative, production practices. While this attempt to bridge thedistinction between ludic and narrative approaches is laudable, theframework they propose is limited in its scope to describe elements ofludic gameplay. These areas are addressed in the later section of thiswriting.

In order to document gaming literacies, Games proposes a three-dialogmodel (2008). The material dialogue provide language to address theoften complex affordances of interrelated objects and system componentsof games. The two other dialogues address perspectives of the real andideal game players. To inform this model, Games draws on conceptions ofthe "virtual, real and projective" identities proposed by Gee to betterunderstand and describe the perspectives of people playing games (Gee,2003, p. 54). The real identities of game players are lost to an extentas they attempt to play a virtual role. This transformation isincomplete and thus a merged, projected identity with elements of bothreal and virtual results.

In the process of designing games imagining the experience of the idealplayer helps addresses issues of interactivity and systems dynamics forexample by keeping them in mind when testing the game themselves. Thusthe ideal player is a useful design construct, helping the designerimagine the virtual player that the real player will attempt to projectthemselves into. This shift in perspective has parallels with theprocess of designing for others outlined in next section (Kafai et al.,1997; Owston et al., 2009).

Finally, the real player dialogue comprises feedback from others in thetesting of the designed games. This vital stage begins the movement ofthe game into a wider social ecology. The interaction between designerand real player happens during the testing of game testing. Theliteracies addressed in the process of getting feedback from realplayers is one of the key stages of a design methodology. We can turn tothe literature surrounding design, especially in game making, to gain adeeper understanding of the processes involved.

**Games Creative Design Process**

In early work exploring the educational potential of game making usingthe LOGO language, Kafai identifies an increased convergence of thepreviously separate domains of design and learning theories (Kafai,1995). Increased interest in problem and project based approaches ineducation mirror the challenge/brief focused nature of design methods.

The importance of the process of design is covered in many foundationalstudies on game making. Salen highlights the value of prototypes in gamedesign (Salen, 2007). Both Salen and Kafai cite the influence on thefield of the process of reflection in action and the value of iteration,both key concepts of the work of SchÃ¶n (1984). In this context, theseconcepts position the game maker a reflexive individual in a socialcontext of a wider game making community. Supportive learning tools orenvironments support the creation of on-going test designs which aregiven feedback and modified further in an iterative process.

The development of the Adventure Author 3D narrative game developmenttool prompted research to understand of the discreet stages of creativegame design? process (Robertson and Nicholson, 2007). These are outlinedby the authors as; exploration, idea generation, game design, gameimplementation, game testing and evaluation were drawn from a mix ofdesign fields including general creative process support, commercialgame design and software design. While analysis of these stages canyield important stages of processes including problem finding,problem-solving, evaluation, communication and collaboration, there isalso a recognition the tension between the utility of this presentationof the processes as discreet stages and the iterative, cyclical natureof the process.

Iteration is also at the heart of Resnick's model for creative designwhich was created in parallel with the Scratch tool (Resnick, 2008,2007). Graphical representation of this model explicitly reference thecreative, expanse spiral beginning and ending with Imagine, and followedby the stages of create, play, share and reflect. A good overview of thebenefits of design in descriptions of the learning in the computerclubhouse project (Resnick and Rusk, 1996).

All parts of the design process allow for collaboration between gamemaking participants. However, while we can draw on other studies ofproject-based approaches to support design processes supportingcollaboration (Bereiter and Scardamalia, 2000; Blumenfeld et al., 1991),Earp and colleagues note that studies in collaboration and game makingare restricted to the area of feedback via peer review (2013).

We can also look to the literature around the more general concept ofdesigning for others (Kafai et al., 1997; Owston et al., 2009) to make agood assumption that the effect of peer review in game design extendsfurther than the sharing part of the design cycle. However althoughimagining the needs of users may influence earlier planning andproduction stages, Kafai notes that this process may not be based onrealistic assumptions and thus may have mixed results.

From the literature, we can see that more work needs to be done oncollaboration in game making. An area of key interest to this study isthat of collaboration in the creation of elements of systems thinking.In video game design, this brings up concepts of game mechanics and gameplay. The interrelationship between these concepts and studiesaddressing them are covered in the following section.

**Systems analysis via game mechanics and game play**

Gee characterises systems thinking in video games as analysis of\"relationships, not isolated events, facts, and skills" (Gee, 2013, p.12). As part of foundational theory to support the design of GamestarMechanic (GSM), Torres (2009) identities four main aspects ofunderstanding of systems thinking; the ability to recognise whenmultiple dynamic relationships exist within a system, identification offeedback loops, analysis of the quality of system linkages and theability to identify similar systems in other domains.

In the design of GSM, Torres and other designers of the game translatethe process of analysing and creating game mechanics into a learningapproach suitable of for formal eduction and after school environments.Foundational systems thinking concepts are simplified into a frameworkconsisting of the key elements of games namely; space, rules, coremechanics, components and goals.

Torres advocates the use of these specialist terms in game creationworkshop early on. He proposes that even incorrect use of the theseterms to build development of understanding in game design contexts, assupported by the work of Hmelo (2000). The adoption of this specificlanguage and concepts can be seen as a manifestation within education ofa wider desire to define terms of game design as a means to facilitateevolution of associated processes and cultures (Costikyan, 2002).

> *More foundational descriptions of Game play here as a parent of game> mechanics or at the start of this* *section*

One of the elements common to these discussions is that of *gamemechanics.* While a broad definition of game mechanics may cover manyelements of game play. Sicart finds a more exact definition of gamemechanics which excludes elements of rules and player challenges andfocuses more on mechanics as key actions that can be carried out byplayers in a gameplay context (Sicart, 2008).

> Following JÃ¤rvinen (2007), the best way of understanding mechanics as> methods is to formalize them as verbs, with other> syntactical/structural elements, such as rules, having influence on> how those verbs act in the game.

Fabricatore (2007) expands the understanding and potential modificationsof game mechanics in relation to gameplay in a study aimed at gamedesigners. Prioritising the user perspective, he outlines the beneficialeffect of reusing and modifying core mechanics to additional purposes.The user then feels justified in the effort of learning one mechanic asit the serves other purposes.

To bring this discussion back to the perspective for learners learningto design video games, while it may be tempting to focus on moresimplistic tasks of the game making process. We can justify theintroduction of more complex concepts to improve user perceptions of thevalue of their own game by making it better. Indeed studies highlightthe desire for young people to make the games they create better asplayable games (Maloney et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2013). However,while these studies focus on learning of computational processes learnedthrough the making of games, empirical studies looking at game making topromote systems thinking are rarer.

One notable exception is the work to promote and assess game designgeneration is the Quest to Learn programme (TekinbaÅ et al., 2010). The"key learning practices" including systems thinking, which integratessome of above work of Torres, and 'play design', which provides a socialand structured feedback process to evolve systems design thinking linkedto the creation of video games. While assessment of these elements hasbeen integrated into a curricular model, more studies along these lineswould be very welcome to support the findings (Shute and Torres, 2012).

Finally to return to the issue of playing games compared to makinggames, It would seem to me likely that the analysis and building ofsystems thinking is indeed for the most part best served by a guidedprocess of making games rather than taking part in game playingcommunities. A question that I will explore further in this study.

 

Appendix A -----------

What follow are notes on a quick review of some of the frameworks usedto categorise the game making learning, or the outcomes of studiesexploring the value of digital game making.

A wide literature review identified "seven distinct -- but closelyrelated -- classes: literacies & skill

sets, individual learning attributes, inclusion, pedagogy, socialissues, technology and curriculum." (Earp, 2015, p. 10).

Other frameworks of gaming literacies exist which have a wider focus oncritical approaches and multiple literacies as well as cultures (A.Peppler and B. Kafai, 2009; Buckingham and Burn, 2007). These worksaimed to extend media literacy and production frameworks to thisemerging area.

We can look at the why games arguments of Hayes and Games in theirreview of tools and strategies as a framework (Hayes and Games, 2008).As Kafai and Burke point out their categorisation of purpose within 4sets namely; learning programming, getting girls to code, learning othersubjects by proxy, understanding designing concepts -- is not exhaustiveand overlaps, often expressly (Burke and Kafai, n.d.).

Kafai uses a wider framework for looking at value of constructionistgames -- personal learning, social and cultural (Kafai and Burke, 2015).While I can see the value of this encyclopedic appraoch to categoriseexisting studies, this seems too broad for the purpose of this review.

What about the "rules, play and culture framework" (Salen and Zimmerman,2003, p. 4).

In this writing, we'll concentrate mostly on rules and play. They notethat the framework can be applied to wider contexts than game design.

Zimmerman later explores , systems, play and design (Perron and Wolf,2009). as gaming literacies,.

There are multiple areas to explore, in this review, given themotivation of developing 21^st^ Century skills, I have prioritised thefollowing;

-   developing critical literacies

-   creative design processes

-   game play and mechanics as systems thinking
