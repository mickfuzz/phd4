*This writing is a potential extract from my literature review, as such, some concepts that would have previously explored in literature around game playing and Digital Game-Based Learning will have already been explored. I will make reference to those in this extract when there is a cross over between the pedagogy of game playing and game making. *

Game Making and Learning Outcomes ~~(rather than Pedagogy)~~ ============================================================

In this extract of writing I was supposed to give an overview of the game making pedagogy grounded in the results of studies on game making programmes.

ADD Summary of some of the design principles and pedagogical principles at play

However, due to the complex environments of game making and the many possible learning processes at play, it not a trivial matter categorise them neatly via pedagogic approaches.\ in this way.

Instead I will look at research categorised by underlying educational motivations for making games in a learning context, namely; the deep learning of subject content, creative and design approaches (specifically to understand making games), learning computer coding, facilitating collaboration and communication, and finally game making as an accessible way to promote access to technology, particularly for girls.

By including any one study in these categories I do not wish to imply that it applies to this area exclusively. Kafai and Burke eschew the simplicity of a similar categorisation in a review by Hayes and Games, noting that there is a lot of crossover in any such division Y. B. Kafai and Burke, 2014). While acknowledging this limit, I propose that this approach has practical merits to examine the details of research.

Before doing so, a look at the context of many of these studies on game making .

-   -   -   

Contextual Background (in Brief) --------------------------------

Studies on game making for eduction began at the start of the use of specialised computer programming languages, such as the text based language LOGO, aimed at young people and other beginners.

As has been explored in the introductory chapter (to be written), the following pedagogical approaches are prevalent in the thinking behid the context of these studies; constructivist and constructionist approaches, discovery learning, situated learning and social-cultural approaches. Constructionist approaches, use of materials, diving in (linked to situated learning) (Kafai and Resnick, 1996).

Game making as rich motivational activity with many potential applications due to project based nature.

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale & integration into schools of COTS games. see (Francis, 2006)

FIND -- literature on the challenges of integrating Game Making into schools.

Games as a way to learn subject material across the curriculum --------------------------------------------------------------

In a seminal study which extended one of the original goals of LOGO, to create worlds where students could interact with math content in a tangible way Papert, 1980a), Kafai used the process of constructing a game in the LOGO language to encourage students at teach and fractions Kafai, 1994),

Through detailed analysis of student learning logs, Kafai identies many wider learning outcomes but includes a deeper understanding of the subject area.

To extend this personal study, Kafai highlights research to support the use of computer game making as a tool to deepen subject knowledge Kafai and Burke, 2015a).

The use of game design to support learning of non-computing curriculum subjects also has precedent in the areas of maths , english language skills Burke, 2012; Owston et al., 2009; Robertson and Good, 2005), nutrition Baytak and Land, 2010), science Kangas, 2010) and history Squire et al., 2005), .

Squire conducted 'longitudinal, 2-year design-based research study investigating the potential of learning communities constructed around Civ3 to help disadvantaged students develop new identities as producers as well a consumers of historical simulation games.' Durga and Squire, 2011)

The study of of the use of the game modification process made possible in the game Civilisation Squire, 2005) includes findings that indicate a more complex understanding of multiple factors at play in historical situations as an outcome of playing and most importantly re-designing the computer simulation.

Squire and colleagues also outlines the process of moving from player to designer and describing the resultant shifts in persective Squire et al., 2005). This work is followed by later studies on emergent learning communities discussion the modding Civilisation Owens, 2011; Squire and Giovanetto, 2008), we can however question the time commitment needed to apply this to wider educational use.

The limits of key studies in Kafai and Burke's review 2015b) should be examined. Many often have extremely limited user base. This is most notable in the case of a widely cited study by Baytak and Land which focused on only three participants 2010). Other studies are only partial in the extent of testing subject knowledge acquisition or deepening of knowledge. In particular, while the authours, as advocates for game making, include studies to supply weight of argument of the use of games making to promote subject knowledge, Many of the original authours are often cautious about this and often highlight other other skill acquisition as a more primary learning activity Baytak and Land, 2010; DiSalvo et al., 2014; Ke, 2014; Schanzer et al., n.d.). It is also striking that a study by Oswton which did quantify subject based skills in literacy had mixed results in this area while more promising results in the area of digital literacy Owston et al., 2009).

Kafai and Burke highlight that the conception of a mutually supportive, dual foci of coding abilities and content study was central to early conceptions of constructionist gaming Papert, 1980b). However, while advocating such an approach, they do concede that it can be problematic in practice. Studies outline a key issue hindering content communication through game making activities is a tendency for the mechanics and processes of game creation to take a precedence over content exploration. Kafai et al., 1998; Ke, 2014), . Students get so wrapped up in the concrete challenge of making a game that deeping and researching the content is neglected. Kafai and Burke reminds us that this tendency is not limited to student producers of games but also happens in the creation of educational games .

This picture matches one of the summary statements of a review by Moreno-Leon and Robles of studies looking beyond the study programming in itselfusing the Scratch visual programming language Moreno-Le√≥n and Robles, 2016). Here the authors, see promise in studies that integrate programming activities into wider curriculum to support subject learning and which show evidence of the wider practices including problems solving and creativity. For subject material these include maths (), english language arts(),

However the authors are also clear that most studies in the area do not conform with certain aspirations in social science research as outlined by Cohen and colleagues Cohen et al., 2011), specifically the group sizes are relatively small, studies often lack control groups and there are few pre and post tests .

Games as a way to learn programming -----------------------------------

A rich tradition of using games to learn programming has its origins in the creation of the LOGO language and subsequent studies incorporating game making and digital art creation Papert, 1980).

Papert's concept of using LOGO language to control Microworlds, digital realms with digital objects with physical characteristics to make more concrete the process of learning object oriented approaches to computer coding still inspires game making tool designers to this day Overmars, 2005; Resnick et al., 2009).

or a Resnick approach - Kafai -- study of game making in computer club house

A study of game making in scratch showed more computational concepts used than other media making activities Adams and Webster, 2012).

Definitions of computational thinking or learning become more sophisticated but are starting to stabilise Grover and Pea, 2013; Werner et al., 2014),

-   Abstractions and pattern generalizations (including models and     simulations) -   Systematic processing of information -   Symbol systems and representations -   Algorithmic notions of flow of control -   Structured problem decomposition (modularizing) -   Iterative, recursive, and parallel thinking -   Conditional logic -   Efficiency and performance constraints -   Debugging and systematic error detection

Many studies highlighting CT, now also highlight elements of systems thinking, present in Grover and Pea's definition as pattern generalisation (in next section).

As an example which starts to address assessment of CT, we can look to a study by Werner and Denner . Here they attempt to quantify the levels of computational thinking, they prioritise the use of design patterns and then combination of those patterns into large game mechanics Werner et al., 2014).

While ambitious and grounded in approach, it is hard to imagine how this process could be automated, certainly, but also effectively done manually, as it prescribes a particular approach which may not suit all coders. (see Papert and Turkle)

This mirrors work done to automatically analyse scratch project to assess levels of Computational Thinking. Here by contracts analysis is of a framework of complexity chiefly of computer language syntax and data types rather than game mechanic concepts of pattern useHoover et al., 2016)

Game making and accessibility -----------------------------

While this is a wide title, it encompasses studies addressing race and gender. This is a problematic area in terms of accessing data. In a review Kafai and Burke note only 50% of studies include such data .

-   Girls Coding GCG-- Denner -- Storytelling Alice -   Roberston 2012 -- Adventure author -   Rapunsel -- Flannagan -- via Hayes and Games -   Black students game making and testing -- Glitch project -- diSalvo

Wider issue of of access to computers from disadvantaged communities.

Possibility to shift attitudes using games, Kafai cites Repenning but data seems missing to support motivational claims, mostly anecdotal ? Repenning, 2013; Repenning et al., 2015).

Less so in other study, there is survey data here. Ryoo et al., 2013). and evidence of increased of take up in programme, but no control?

There seems more convincing data in the Reynolds/ Globaloria data. Reynolds and Chiu, n.d.)

Games as a game design activity -------------------------------

A distinction between constructionist approaches to teaching programming to open up future possibilities of design, to a more accelerated adoption of game design discourse

What is design methodology and practice. We can link this to iteration and practice based approaches. Popular in the areas of the arts and especially STUDIO based approaches (see below).

Linking to the professional habits of game design via Salen and Zimmerman,

There have been explicit links made to design approach to as a process to support the learning Computation Thinking via the Use, Modify, Create approach Allan et al., n.d.).

Making this more educational via Torres, and then embodied in the GSM tool.

Systems thinking - link in game star mechanic, making as non-linear approach. link to design / systems thinking Kynigos, 2015).- and the teaching of not programming but the language of game design Salen, 2007). (check out the reading list here) -- Quest to Learn as example

For a more in depth of the assessment of computational thinking and the link with systems thinking, see Werner et al., 2014).

In this analysis we students advance in their stystems thinking through their understanding beyond the structural elements of systems to include behaviour and function Hmelo-Silver and Pfeffer, 2004). More advanced students use mental model as an aid to create complex, dynamic responses to ill-formed problems. Werner et all note that in game making we can see a link to the pedagogic approach of problem-based learning.

And wider still design thinking in education and studio thinking Hetland et al., 2013; Hokanson, 2013; Hokanson and Gibbons, 2014). This link with arts based practice is made in Denham and Guyotte, 2018).

We can also for example Resnick's take on iterative spiral design process linked to a kindergarden process Resnick, 2007).

Compare this to Roberson's design processes Robertson and Nicholson, 2007)

The complexity of activities carried out in games can be seen as a community ecosystem similar to that of a workplace.

The work of Lave and Wegner around communities of practice. Explain concept of legitimate peripheral participation

A very useful paper on learning by design and some of the prerequisits Kolodner et al., n.d.).

Provoking collaboration, reflection, communication and other new literacies ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THERE IS A BRIDGE THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THE LAVE AND WEGNER -- COP ABOVE IN GAME DESIGN AND SHAFFER'S EPISTEMIC GAMES AND GEE'S PROFESSIONAL DISCOURCES -- OR MOVE SOME OF THE BELOW ABOVE AND RECAP IN INTRO HERE, AND MOVE QUICKLY ON TO SPECIFICS OF C21 SKILLS

This section is a bit of a catch all, for wider C21, skills Bermingham et al., 2013)

In an analysis of wider frameworks Voogt and Roblin, 2012), twenty first century skills have been summarised as collaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social/cultural skills & citizenship, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and productivity/development of quality products. We can see that many of these skills have already been covered in our tour of the research on game making as an educational activity. What we have left can be said to overlap with the concept of multiple literacies.

In terms of group communication and collaboration, while research has highlighted the potential of game making to encourage collaboration, there are comparatively few emprical studies available to support this claim Earp et al., 2013). .

We can see a direct link to studies surrounding game playing in the area of the value of linking activities to promote reflection.

Concepts of mulitliteracies wider definitions of digital literacies, and studies supporting this., and more specifically attempts to design learning environments which support this kind of approach.

The acquisition of these multiliteracies are often said to happen through engagement with additional activities around the game. Gee refers to this as metagaming, (where?)

This is a b

Discourses in this New Literacy context can comprise a wide variety of communication forms to include "the burgeoning variety of text forms associated with information and multimedia technologies" The New London Group, 1996, p. 61). In the context of computer games this is particularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements which may including online play or internet forums which contain conversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis, live chat possibilities and so on.

Kafai and Burke also look to embrace possibilities of online platforms through 'connected learning' Kafai and Burke, 2015a). They use a social lens highlight studies from Denner on pair programming as an effective social intervention in middle school Denner and Werner, 2007), and reference an study on peer interactions in game creation in Logo Ching and Kafai, 2008). The later study builds on previous analysis of the limits of teacher support in project based approaches, advocates more peer interaction as a tactical response, and develops a model to allow a richer description of helping activities.

It≈ç documents the value of the informal nature of digital explorations and identify play, and researches the resulting learning outcomes It≈ç, 2010). Diy media production and other meaning making in game playing communities are included in what been termed participatory culture Jenkins, 2009). Any studies?

Discussion  -----------

Some if not all of this topic suit introduction and some development in the introductory chapter.

Computational Thinking Widened as Power Grab

Widening definitions of computation thinking.

Resnick's work extends concepts, and then practices and perspectives.

Kafai, widens scope to include personal, social, cultural and tangible practices in a model which in cludes computational participation as a key skill, claiming that 'The framing of learning as personal, social, cultural and tangible is key in realizing that computational thinking needs to move beyond mere problem solving.' Y. Kafai and Burke, 2014, p. 3)

Could give overview of Resnick and Kafai on take on CT which is (based the tenents of constructionism) - Brennan and Resnick, 2012). espc

The reframing of various design and problems solving skills within a certain subject area, can be seen to be a political decision, however, there is evidence that this has not been successful in UK despite extensive rebranding and retraining focusing on the wider value of computational thinking.

Software, Affordances and Pedagogical Implications

This is present in the framing and explicit aims of some of the software tools which are brought into this domain. As an example we can look at an analysis of Games and Squire Games and Squire, 2008). ) They describe early efforts like the Boxer language and LOGO as situated as as a tangible environment to allow more concrete approach to programming but one which retains a need to teach fundamentals of programming before students can progress to adapting the tool to their own designs or games.

Scratch has an aim to lower barriers to entry much further via a visual approach to language construction and to extend possible project aims to maximise user engagement and accessibility .

In contrast other Games and Squire position a software tool like Gamestar Mechanic as more directly leveraging the pre=existing knowledge and motivation to create games which are presumed to be already part of the discourse of young people.

In many ways this returns to the debate of bricoleur vs abstract designer which was identified early in observations of the way learners learn to code Papert and Turkle, 1990).

Papert and microworlds, locating a genesis of situated thinking, constructionism, in comparison with piagets focus on decontextualised abstract knowledge, see Ackerman and other female authors in hard vs soft approaches

PERHAPS end of this return to the source and wrap things up here.

Lack of Studies that conform to certain standards

There is a clear lack of studies that conform to a rigour educational research approach as outlined by Cohen et al .

I would agree that more rigourous studies would be useful. At the same time, this lack could explained by several factors including; the rapidly moving characteristics of the toolsets which suits pilot studies, and the high level of expertise. enthusiasm and experience needed to balance the multiple competencies of programming concepts and game design patterns.

Part of this may be due to the challenge of context outlined in the next section and reluctance to devote the time needed to progress with a project based approach to curriculum knowledge acquisition which deepens understanding of context but at the expense of time covering other material.

Returning to the challenge context

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale for integration of playing complex games in schools Francis, 2006).

These difficulties of application are in part why this study focuses on the potential of a family learning environment to act as a more supportive and flexible space for such complex learning.

In focusing on the area of family learning it is not my intention to disregard the potential for game making in more formal environments. I do however wish to avoid an overly idealistic or realistic perspective on such potential which ignores the level of resources available to primary and secondary schools. I feel that such an approach a more responsible approach to that of some of the advocates of digital strategies which seems to be belittling to schools or professionals not integrating interactive, creative digital environments into their classrooms.

I return in this section to some of the previous studies to examine the issue of scalability and suitability of classroom integration to draw out particular contextual challenges.

I also wish to highlight the potential for family learning environments to address some or all of these issues.
