In Tinkering Is Serious Play\Bronwyn Bevan, Mike Petrich and Karen Wilkinson

Sogme researchers caution that there\'s a risk of presenting makerlessons as step-by-step, recipe-like fabrication activities (Resnick &Rosenbaum, 2013). For example, Blikstein (2013) recounts how hisstudents\' introduction to using laser cutters

Fabrication vs tinkering.

Foundational concepts, skills for tinkering.

Interplay of approach mirrors step forward and back.

**Overall pattern**

Making computer games has great potential supporting authentic learning.(Schaffer and resnick), involving cross curriculum learning involvingother subjects, family learning possibilities, creating a connectedcommunity of participants.

There are many chances to li nk game making projects to real life out ofschool by linking to campaigns or public education. How can this be donewithout losing the playful elements of playing games?

What are the overlapping concepts contained in the interrelated termsareas of interest of this study. Including

**How best to teach code using the making of games in a real lifecontext, effectively and in an accessible way?**

This writing explores a variety of methods that can support these aims,focusing on the wider educational environments and processes rather thanthe tools involved. It does keep in mind a context of making transitionto a real coding language and environment, rather than a playground.

In conclusion, these are all interesting to the subject in hand.

The pathway goes from assembling conducive environments with a focus onscience, coding complexity, to a value of participatory, and interestdriven process, to finally a more outwardly focused value of civicaction, collective response and group exploration of complex societalissues.

**Constructivist approach**

Further areas for investigation, questions that arise

-   What black boxes for JavaScript game making?

**Different focuses of studies on gaming**

Lots of studies on playing, less on making, more on making / modding asa fan practice, than as an educational one (Gee Tran). The authorsstruggle to define what counts as gamemaking with the increasingpopularity of sandbox style environments, and modding levels incommercial games.

They cite p

"Hayes-Gee, E. R., and K. Tran. 2015. "Video Game Making and Modding."In

Handbook of Research on the Societal Impact of Digital Media, ed. B.Guzzetti and M. Lesley, 238--267. Hershey, PA: IGI Global."

**Tinkering and computing**

Tinkering while normally associated with physical objects and hardwaretools has also been used as a term to describe software tools thatsupport accessible and open ended production processes.

In particular a metaphor of low floors and wide walls has been appliedto scratch and similar tools.

This can be contrasted with the exploratorium framework.

Where this is lacking is in the wider context for learning, how do youset up a learning environment that best supports the potential ofsoftware tinkering tools?

This is where, cop and pbl fit in. Pbl, ibl , dbl, etc, are all interrelated terms and processes for actively constructed learning drawing onconstructivist learning theory. Processes vary in terns of , timecommitment, genuineness of challenge and community, and artificiality ofsupport processes.

**Web and tinkering, does it fit? **

The web and browser as a tool for tinkering approach can be analysedagainst these frameworks.

There is an idea of taking code apart by remixing it, by seeing what isinside.

It may fit some aspects of a tinkering framework but there may besupplementary activities to build support structures, feedbackprocesses, increase tangibility and visual appeal of materials,excitement and feedback processes, build motivation.

**Advantages of technical restrictions spurring creative responses**

Cf game jam

**Memory and processing power**

There is a role of restriction of resources and scope which activitydesigners use to help focus learning around target areas and thusfacilitate complexities in challenges.

The use of canvas and a 2d , 8/ 16 bit, approach to gaming is such arestriction. The process of technical limits provoking innovation iswell documented anecdotally. Is this bourne out in research?

Getting closer to the metal,

Advantages of black boxes in tinkering, some things help simplify thingsin a good way, ie constricting focus on elements of particular interest- see

Look at scratch as a black box, visual programming as a black boxtecnique or not

Compare to phaser as a bloack box, the use of a real javascript syntax,but with some simplification

**Structured vs Unstructured vs Borrowing approaches to coding**

Some old school approaches to structured or unstructured programming. Ifyou focus too much on syntax then you'll miss out on the problemssolving possibilities made possible by a creative computing environment.

The above chapter outlines collaboration or the borrowing of code as animportant stage in learning to programme.

And the following paper references the research in theory but morereading needed to back this up.

Wenger (1998) stressed the importance of having access to a "sharedrepertoire of communal

resources" to help shape a "community of practice."

**A thick approach to creating a game making community**

There are a large number of interrelated tools and processes andpotential outcomes. But rather than shutting these down and isolatingthem there is a value in taking. A holistic approach to the study thesevarious factors as their interplay is crucial to the successful creationof our target of a playful game making community able to embrace andwork through complex issues.

The nature of time or technical restraints of using particular softwarecan serve to level the playing field between participants. Additionallyor

Can be intensive and linked to a culture of exploitation.

However many educators are doing this in an accessible way.

The focus is on creative environment, and low commitment, ie justattending the event and taking inspiration from what can be donerelatively quickly.

**Serious Games**

How serious are serious games or how playful. Contrast back to magiccircle as a way of creating a safe space.

And elements of more formal games vs everyday playfulness.

<http://gamestudies.org/0601/articles/rodriges>

> A core contribution of Fluxus and other contemporary art groups to the> study of play lies precisely in their systematic commitment to playful> experimentation outside the magic circle of classical art institutions> (Higgins, 1984;1998). Performance artist Allan Kaprow, a key> participant in those events, has given an excellent overview of this> tendency (Kaprow, 1993)

The study highlights Huzinger's aversion to play being appropriated fornon-playful ends, but shows that serious subjects can have playfulelements, and where they do, there is often a sense of risk taking andcutting across social and playful concerns.

Game designers then can highight these area and encourage theexplorations of the permable zones between the serious and playful.Playing with the conventions of the magic circle,

**Unexpected locations or variants **

From my perspective the fit and especially mobile media lab fit aplayful approach in that the first impressions are often surrealist inentering a part tent in a field and seeing a fully functioning media lab, distract desk, audio media production, video editing teams, photostations, satellite internet connection.

Use of the film screening involving them to close the circle. Effects ofbuilding community and creating empowering paths into autonomous selfproduction. **Gauntlet chapter. **

**Critical Making**
