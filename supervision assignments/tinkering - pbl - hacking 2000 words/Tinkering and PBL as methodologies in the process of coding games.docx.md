**Tinkering and PBL as methodologies in the process of making digital games**

The initial writing work set was to define in detail what key processes are and what factors are implicit in the terms used. Given the starting area of tinkering and PBL as methodologies in the process of coding games, some of issues of interest highlighted in our conversation include learner control, motivation and the invitation to play of the materials, learner collaboration and the relatability of the projects and materials involved.

PBL characteristics.

Introduction ------------

-   Why is game making interesting in a nutshell?

-   Why is tinkering / PBL / COP interesting areas to approach for this     > domain?

-   Define IBL, PBL and perhaps CBL as overlapping ideas

-   Other thoughts, why is PBL still struggling to be implemented at     > school level, and tinkering moving to expensive construction kits     > (Krajcik et al., 1994).

The core ingredients of an IBL approach that most researchers are in agreement with are:

• learning stimulated by inquiry, i.e. driven by questions or problems

• learning based on a process of seeking knowledge and new understanding

• a learning-centred approach to teaching in which the role of the teacher is to act as a facilitator

• a move to self-directed learning with students taking increasing responsibility for their learning and the development of skills in self-reflection

We can summarise some of the characteristics of EBL as follows:

-   Engagement with a complex problem or scenario, that is sufficiently     > open-ended to allow a variety of responses or solutions

-   Students direct the lines of enquiry and the methods employed

-   The enquiry requires students to draw on existing knowledge and     > identify their required learning needs

-   Tasks stimulate curiosity in the students, encouraging them to     > actively explore and seek out new evidence

-   Responsibility falls to the student for analysing and presenting     > that evidence in appropriate ways and in support of their own     > response to the problem
