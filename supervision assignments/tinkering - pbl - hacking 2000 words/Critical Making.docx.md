Making a link between critical thinking and making objects. This supportthe objects to think with part of constructionst approaches and bumps itinto the world of civic concerns beyond science and maths knowledge.

Maps a structured approach to this in three phases, including anexplicit link to academic areas, link to texts or ideas, makingprototypes to map ideas, revising and reflection.

. So this seems to have a focus on HE or above rather than earlier ages,but actually, can be imagined earlier if translated.

For example, prototypes could be physical games, or drama interventions,texts can be videos or online resources, and making can be games,revision can be playtesting and feedback.

It also has a focus on the process fo making as an educational andreflective practice rather than on the object being made. In fact thevalue of the final product as a stand alone object with meaning isexplicitly devalued in comprariason.

There is clear outline of three key elements of constructionism herevaluing, possibility for emotional involvement/ affect, transitionalobjects (projecting your self into objects to think with), and the valueof messing about.

The case study worked with sharing theory and arduino flowers to mimictheories. The game excise required diagrammatic simplification ofcomplex theories. Thus is this really an advantage or a good tool toexplore cocepts?

The author highlight a gulf between technical work and social work thatcritical making can bridge. Specifically in the explorationof societalissues effected by technology.

A disctonction about caring about an issue and a more informed caringfor an issue informed by experience is linked to layout concepts ofmatters of fact (which can't be changed) and matters of concern.

Designin\* things and getting better granularity on what can or can't bechanged and how makes the making process empowering in the sense that wegain greater understanding on our environment as a designed space ratherthan as the natural state of things.

He also notes the positive impact of the open source nature of thehardware used in this project and the positive impact of the arduinocommunity.
