Validates constructionism and a Kafia/ Resnik / Papert definition of it.

There is a great quote from Buner there,

Some years ago I wrote some very

insistent articles about the importance of discovery learning-learning

on one\'s own, or as Piaget put it later (and I think better), learningby

inventing. What I am proposing here is an extension of that idea, or

better, a completion. My model of the child in those days was very

much in the tradition of the solo child mastering the world by repre-

senting it to himself in his own terms. In the intervening years I have

come increasingly to recognize that most learning in most settings is a

communal activity, a sharing of the culture. It is not just that thechild

must make his knowledge his own, but that he must make it his own in

a community of those who share his sense of belonging to a culture. It

is this that leads me to emphasize not only discovery and invention but

the importance of negotiating and sharing-in a word, of joint culture

creating as an object of schooling and as an appropriate step en route

to becoming a member of the adult society in which one lives out one\'s

Life.
