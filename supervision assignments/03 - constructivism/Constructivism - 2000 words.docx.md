Introduction------------

This is a review of fundamental tenets of constructivism in itsapplication to a teaching and learning environment.

My studies are concerned with complex, intergenerational learningenvironments involving many tools.

These can be considered a constructivist learning environment

In the last 2 decades new frame works evironments have emerged inresponse to constructivist-inspired views of learning (Jonassen, 1991).

Fromhttp://www.csiss.org/SPACE/workshops/2007/UCSB/docs/ertmer\_newby1993.pdf

The philosophical assumptions underlying both the behavioral andcognitive theories are

primarily objectivistic; that is: the world is real, external to thelearner. The goal of

instruction is to map the structure of the world onto the learner(Jonassen, 1991b). A

number of contemporary cognitive theorists have begun to question thisbasic

objectivistic assumption and are starting to adopt a more constructivistapproach to

learning and understanding: knowledge \"is a function of how theindividual creates

meaning from his or her own experiences\" (p.10)

There is similar in Cooper's Cooper, P.A., 1993. Paradigm Shifts inDesigned Instruction: From Behaviorism to Cognitivism to Constructivism.Educational Technology 33, 12--19.

Outline of key concepts-----------------------

From Grabinger

Grabinger, R.S., Dunlap, J.C., 1995. Rich environments for activelearning: a definition. ALT-J 3, 5--34.[[https://doi.org/10.1080/0968776950030202]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.1080/0968776950030202)

**Three main characteristics**

The first characteristic of constructivism is the notion that knowledgeis not a product to be accumulated but an **active and evolvingprocess** in which the learner attempts to make sense out of the world

The second characteristic is the notion that people **conditionalizetheir knowledge in**

**personal ways** (Gurney, 1989). That is, they acquire knowledge informs that enable them

to use that knowledge later.

The third major characteristic of constructivism is the importance ofc**ollaboration and**

**social negotiation of meaning.** Learning happens within a socialcontext. Conceptual

growth comes from sharing our perspectives and testing our ideas withothers, modifying

our internal representations in response to that process of negotiation(Bednar et al,

1991). Common understandings and shared meanings are developed throughinteraction

among peers and teachers. This, is the cultural aspect of knowledge.

More in depth on key concepts-----------------------------

### Active and evolving process

Origingal quote from

From Brown, J.S., Collins, A., Duguid, P., 1989. Situated Cognition andthe Culture of Learning. Educational Researcher 18, 32.https://doi.org/10.2307/1176008

A concept, for example, will continually evolve with each new occasionof use, because new

situations, negotiations, and activities inevitably recast it in a new,more densely textured

form. So a concept, like the meaning of a word, is always underconstruction, (p. 33)

According to Piaget (1958), assimilation and accommodation require anactive learner, not a passive one, because problem-solving skills cannotbe taught, they must be discovered.

Problem of 'active' as a keyword - everything is active eveninstructions - again instructionism as straw man

Idea of Spiral Curriculum Bruner - and readiness

### Conditionalize their knowledge in personal ways

This is described as indexing

It is the contextualisation, real contexts,

Context is key to creating Puzzlement described by Duffy & Savery

### Collaboration and social negotiation of meaning

Cultural social and historical import of constructivism

Link to Activity theory, russian school

Also concepts of viability from Bruner

Procedures to apply key concepts to educational settings--------------------------------------------------------

There is more room here for criticality.

ID as field linked , which can be mined for competing view points.

From Lebow

Lebow, D., 1993. Constructivist values for instructional systems design:Five principles toward a new mindset. ETR&D 41, 4--16.https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02297354

"collaboration, personal autonomy, generativity, reflectivity, activeengagement, personal relevance, and pluralism."

This is quite in depth and could cover a lot of ground but some work onthis is probably needed,

Admit that this is a short tour and that more work has been done on it .

These are some key procedures that will be relevant to the production ofa constructivist learning environment

-   Scaffolding - bruner

-   ZOP - vygotsky

And some from [[Duffy andCunningham]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SCqGp6j6rNUCP8srbcH57Hyck0NYO-yVB1L4IFyhAAY/edit#)

-   Discovery learning

-   Zone of proximal development

-   Scaffolding

-   Cognitive apprenticeship

-   Coaching

-   Context

-   Learner control

-   Assessment

-   Collaborative Learning

There are also many heuristics from Instructional Design that may yieldinteresting concepts

Wilson, B. G. (1995). Metaphors for instruction: Why we talk aboutlearning\environments. Educational Technology, 35 (5), 25-30.

In general, Wilson characterises constructivist learning environments asopen systems.

Learner choice is emphasised.

But chaos is likely, so good design to hep support learning is needed.

Here are some from Ertmer, Peggy A., and Timothy J. Newby. "Behaviorism,Cognitivism, Constructivism: Comparing Critical Features From anInstructional Design Perspective." Performance Improvement Quarterly 26,no. 2 (January 1, 2013): 43--71. https://doi.org/10.1002/piq.21143.

1\. An emphasis on the identification of the context in which the skillswill be learned

and subsequently applied \[anchoring learning in meaningful contexts\].

2\. An emphasis on learner control and the capability of the learner tomanipulate

information \[actively using what is learned\].

3\. The need for information to be presented in a variety of differentways \[revisiting

content at different times, in rearranged contexts, for differentpurposes, and from

different conceptual perspectives\].

4\. Supporting the use of problem-solving skills that allow learners togo \"beyond the

information given.\" \[developing pattern-recognition skills, presentingalternative

ways of representing problems\].

5\. Assessment focused on transfer of knowledge and skills \[presentingnew

problems and situations that differ from the conditions of the initialinstruction\].
