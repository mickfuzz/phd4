Learning in Higher Education

This section introduces and examines t

heories of learning that support the use

of game-based learning in Higher E

ducation and that have influenced the

research presented in this thesis. T

he starting point is a discussion of the

constructivist perspective on learning and teaching, which is followed by a

discussion of collaborative learning,

experiential learning, problem-based

learning and adult learning.

2.1.1 Constructivism

The way in which learning is perceived

has changed significantly over the last

century. Until the late 1950s t

he behaviourist school of thought was

predominant, which saw the mind as a 'black box' that could be studied by

examining observable changes in behaviour,

where learning could be reinforced

and the consequences of our actions woul

d affect subsequent behaviour. In the

late 1950s, cognitivism became the domin

ant instructional paradigm, where the

focus is on thought processes behind behavio

ur, looking particularly at the main

areas of cognition, sensory receptors,

executive control, working memory and

long-term memory. More recently, the c

onstructivist paradigm has become the

prevailing way in which the theory of

learning is described (Cooper, 1993).

Bruner (1966), one of the first

theorists to be consider

ed by others to work

within the constructivist scope, proposed th

e idea that learning is active and that

learners construct their own knowl

edge about a subject through active

engagement in learning by building on

past knowledge and experiences. He

theorised that instruction

should engender a predispositi

on to learn, specify the

ways in which to structure knowledge so

that learning is most effective and

specify the most effective sequences in

which to present the materials to be

learned. In its totality, the constructivist

view consists of a number of theories

and perspectives; however, Savery and Duffy (1995) provide a summary of

three fundamental precepts:

•

Situated cognition -- individuals'

understandings are developed by

interactions with their environment; t

hey are formed by a combination of

content, context, activity and goal and ar

e individually constructed; they

cannot be shared, but compatibility

of understandings can be tested

through discussion with others.

•

Cognitive puzzlement -- cognitive conf

lict or puzzlement is the stimulus

for learning and determines the or

ganisation and nature of what is

learned; there is always a goal for l

earning something and this goal is a

primary factor in determining what

the learner attends to and what is

constructed.

•

Social collaboration

-- knowledge evolves through social negotiation and

through the evolution of the viabilit

y of individual understandings; the

social environment is critical to

the development of understanding, and

other individuals are a

primary mechanism for

testing understandings

and providing sources of alternativ

e views to challenge thinking.

The constructivist perspective hypothesis

es that people learn by constructing

their own perspectives about the worl

d, by problem-solving and personal

discovery. The design of student-cent

red online learning environments and

interactive, exploratory learning object

s has been very much influenced by the

constructivist perspective (e.g. Grabing

er et al, 1997; Land &

Hannafin, 2000).

Wilson (1996) defines a construc

tivist learning environment as:

a place where learners may work

together and support each other as

they use a variety of tools and in

formation resources in their guided

pursuit of learning goals and problem-s

olving activities. (Wilson, p 5.)

Honebein (1996) presents a number of

pedagogic goals of the design of

constructivist learning environments. He sa

ys that they shoul

d support students

to take responsibility for their learni

ng, including the topics they pursue,

methods of learning and strategies for

problem-solving; provide experience of

multiple perspectives and viewpoints;

encourage ownership and self-awareness

of the learning process; make l

earning realistic and relevant, based on

authentic, real-life activities; make lear

ning a social experience, supported by

collaboration and interaction;

use multiple modes of representation; and use

rich media.

forwards through a linear sequence, to

the use of hyperlinked environments and

virtual interactive worlds (Sims, 1997).

Gee (2003) argues that com

puter games reflect the

experiential learning cycle

in that students must ex

amine the virtual environmen

t, reflect on the situation

and form a hypothesis about what somethi

ng in the situation might mean, and

re-probe the virtual world to see what effect

it has. While it is true that this cycle

maps onto learning within the game worl

d, it does not necessarily provide

students with scope for the meta-cognitive pr

ocesses that are required for them

to truly engage with and take responsibility

for their own learning when applying

their learned knowledge and skills to the r

eal world. It is important to recognise

that game-based learning is necessarily par

t of a larger learning process and

should be considered in terms of the other

activities and reflection that surround

the game and not as a stand-alone activity.

2.1.4 Problem-based learning

Problem-based learning as a teaching

and learning method is considered here

because of the clear parallels betw

een a problem-based approach and the

activities that take place in certain ty

pes of computer game, such as puzzle or

adventure games.

Problem-based learning generally involves

small groups of

students working

with a facilitator to tackle

real-life, cross-disciplin

ary problems. Resources are

made available to the students but informa

tion on how to tackle the problem is

not provided, and work is carried out int

ensively on one problem at a time. This

provides activity-based learning, with

students taking more responsibility for

their own learning and learning in a r

eal-world context (Boud & Feletti, 1991).

The Internet can also be used to facili

tate problem-based learning. Jonassen

\(2002) describes a number of different ty

pes of problem that can be addressed

in this context, including logic problems,

application of algorithms or rules,

diagnostic or troubleshooting problems,

strategic problems,

design problems

and dilemmas.

Researchers have highlighted that comput

er games have the facility to create

real-life problem-solving experiences. K

iili (2005) argues that

"games provide a

N J Whitton

2 Review of literature on learning and games

25

meaningful framework for offe

ring problems to students. In

fact, a game itself is

a big problem that is composed of sma

ller causally linked problems." (Kiili,

p 17), and in a survey of 25 educational

'experts' using game-based learning,

de Freitas (2006) found that "

broadly the experts interviewed seemed to

advocate the use of simulations a

nd games for problem-based learning."

(de Freitas, 2006).

However, it is important to note that

problem-based learning is essentially a

collaborative method of learni

ng, and to exploit the full potential of this teaching

philosophy in a gaming situat

ion, collaborative or mult

i-player games would be

better suited to provide this than games played individually.

2.1.5 Adult learning

The research described in this thesis

is concerned with t

he implementation of

games in Higher Education, rather

than examining the use of games with

school-based learners. Therefore, an under

standing of how learners in Higher

Education may differ in their approaches to

learning is important in the design of

any learning experience, games included.

Although 18-year-old first year under

graduates may have more in common with

school-based learners, there

is a growing repr

esentation of mature and adult

learners in Higher Education. Adult lear

ners are typically defined as individuals

"who have returned to learning after so

me kind of separation from a formal

educational environment such as school, co

llege or university" (Hodson et al,

2001, p 327) and who may typically have more work and personal

responsibilities, caring commitments, gr

eater life experiences and a need for

greater study guidance.

Adult learning theory, or andragogy (Kno

wles, 1998), argues that the key

characteristics of adult learners, as re

lated to their motivations and learning

needs, are that:

1\. Adults need to know why they need

to know something before they are

willing to invest time and energy in learning it.

2\. Adults have a deep psychological need to be self-directing and to take

responsibility for their own learning.

N J Whitton

2 Review of literature on learning and games

3\. Adults have a wide variety of backg

rounds and experience and it can not

be assumed that all adult learners co

me from the same starting point.

4\. Adults become ready to learn somethi

ng when they need to know it to be

able to cope effectively with real-life situations.

5\. Adults are task-oriented in their l

earning. They learn things best in the

context of using them to do things they want to do.

It is important to note, however, that pr

essure of life and work commitments and

limited time to devote to study is bec

oming more true of younger students also.

Adult learning theory has much in comm

on with the constructivist approach in

that it advocates learners taking responsib

ility for their lear

ning, and learning

through experience in an authentic context, so

it can be argued it is actually of

relevance to all learners to varying degrees.

Rogers (1989) also describes a number of

practical factors that contribute to

effective learning in adults, again highl

ighting the importanc

e of the learning

being relevant to real life and also t

he need to enable adult learners to control

the pace of their work, breaking down

learning into manageable chunks, basing

learning on previous experience and maki

ng use of the wealth of previous

experiences, and creating an awareness of

the meta-cognitive processes

associated with learning.

Adult learning theory highlights the fact

that motivation to learn is paramount

and that learning activities must be pur

poseful. This brings into question the

acceptability of game-based learning wi

th adult learners, who may perceive

games as frivolous and a waste of time (e

mpirical evidence to support this is

discussed in Chapter 4).

In all, the theories discussed in this

section -- constructivism, collaborative

learning, experiential lear

ning, problem-based learning, and adult learning -- are

closely related in terms of pedagogic stanc

e; that is, empowering learners to

take control of developing their own lear

ning, questioning in r

eal-life situations

and learning from others. The next sect

ion considers the characteristics of

games that might form a definition

of game-based lear

ning, presents a

framework of genres of game

from which to consider

which are most applicable
