**Three main characteristics**

The first characteristic of constructivism is the notion that knowledge is not a product to be accumulated but an active and evolving process in which the learner attempts to make sense out of the world

The second characteristic is the notion that people conditionalize their knowledge in

personal ways (Gurney, 1989). That is, they acquire knowledge in forms that enable them

to use that knowledge later.

The third major characteristic of constructivism is the importance of collaboration and

social negotiation of meaning. Learning happens within a social context. Conceptual

growth comes from sharing our perspectives and testing our ideas with others, modifying

our internal representations in response to that process of negotiation (Bednar et al,

1991). Common understandings and shared meanings are developed through interaction

among peers and teachers. This, is the cultural aspect of knowledge.
