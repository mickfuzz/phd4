**Starting notes on Piaget**

From **Papert on Piaget** By Seymour Papert

\"Children have real understanding only of that which they invent themselves, and each time that we try to teach them something too quickly, we keep them from reinventing it themselves.\"

Piaget moves epistimology from a branch of philosopy to a science in own right, from different child stages of a ways on knowing, t feminist and afrocentric epistimologies

Word of day

Endogenous - having internal origin

Vico - constructivist in outlook as negates the cartesian generality of knowledge, and regrets the silo approach of universities, as the devil is in the detail.

More specifically, the value of the experiential.

**Exploring different types of Constructivism.**

A critique of many, but mainly radical constructivism. Vs empiricism.

It's kind of annoying, focusing too much on the material reality opposed to social constructs, or shared concepts. Often these critiques use radical constructivism as a strawman.

In chapter 7

There is a good overview of radical vs social constructivism and various varieties.

Genetic Epistemology

Piaget: the growth of knowledge is a progressive

construction of embedded structures of thinking.

Earlier, less powerful structures of thinking are included in later, more powerful ones

Schemata

Thinking involves use of organized structures (schemata) for representing information

Ex. Sensory-motor action schema: a way of obtaining certain types of goals in a range of situations

Ex. Class composition schema: a whole formed of two

groups is as large or larger than either group Drew upon ideas from group theory in mathematics and formal logic

Schemata are structures for actively engaging the world If they prove inadequate, they must change

Nativism vs. Empiricism

Nativism: (Certain form s of) knowledge cannot be

acquired through experience We must be born with it Although it may not be expressed until an appropriate maturational stage

Empiricism: knowledge is built up from experience using basic minimal inbuilt capacities

For example, the ability to be classically conditioned or to learn via the law of effect Same limited alternatives seem to affect biological

development: preformationism vs epigenesis

Piaget: Neither Nativist nor Empiricist

Empiricist

Children are active builders of their knowledge Like little scientists, they constantly construct and test their own theories of the world

"Intelligence does not by any means appear at once derived from mental development, like a higher mechanism, and radically distinct from those which have preceded it. Intelligence presents, on the contrary, a remarkable continuity with the acquired or even inborn processes on which it depends and at the same time makes use of." (Piaget, 1963, p. 21)

Constructivism

\"I am a constructivist. I think that knowledge is a matter of constant, new construction, by its interaction with reality, and that it is not pre-formed. There is a continuous creativity.\"

"The essential functions of the mind consist in understanding and in inventing, in other words, in building up structures by structuring reality." (Piaget, 1971, p.27)

"I think that all structures are constructed and that the fundamental feature is the course of this construction: Nothing is given at the start, except some limiting points on which all the rest is based. The structures are neither given in advance in the human mind nor in the external world, as we perceive or organize it." (Piaget, 1977b, p.63).

The Constructivist Fallacy

Learning is a matter of hypothesis testing and that requires the ability to formulate the hypothesis before testing it. But if the person can already formulate the

hypothesis, then it is not constructed, but innate

"It is never possible to learn a richer logi on the basis of a weaker logic, if what you mean by

learning is hypothesis formation and confirmation."

(Fodor, 1980).

Avoiding the Constructivist Fallacy

To avoid the "fallacy":

• Must account for the hypotheses (Piaget's schemata) which are to

be tested without assuming they were preformed in the mind

• Not sufficient to propose that they depend upon processes of maturation,

since that allows that the directions are all laid down in advance, which

is all the sophisticated nativist requires

• Only possibility is to allow that the hypotheses (schemata) are themselves
