Notes from above....

Gaming Fluencies as a way of bringing in flexible approaches to use ofmedia. They contrast this with media literacy, and computer codingskills,with the wider range of production possibilities beinghighlighted. Juggling technical and creative processes.

This builds on Gaming Literacies concept.

2D design is seen as an easier entry point, Block programming avoidssyntax errors.

This paper looks more at the design elements of particular case studiesand the advantage of the tool involved.

They promote the advantages of scratch as a media-rich, non-genrespecific tool, so not just for gaming, compared to some other tools theycall specialized toolsets, ie Game Star

They also have a wide range of projects analyised this archive, bygenre, by creative aspects (use of sound, animation, persperctives),technical aspects (complexity of structures, and sophistication ofinteraction).

They made comparisons of different years of the programme to demonstrateincreased sophistication of these elements and thus the deveopment of asustainable video game design community.

Thus the analysis of the work created and the deriviations of and impactof those case studies is used a way of studying peer interaction.

It does highlight video game making as a high status marker of theinvididuals that used the club house.

The case studies forefront the design process and particularly interfacedesign as a complex skill needed in modern digital life.

They bring up the "transparency" issue and going beyond the black box,linking this to the domain of USERs and Producers. There are issues ofmedia participation as well and understanidng digital technology throughdesign.

One example is the use of copyrightted material, and game design as wayof exploring media ownership issues.

BUT there is no follow up on this aspect in tihs papre bur refernece
