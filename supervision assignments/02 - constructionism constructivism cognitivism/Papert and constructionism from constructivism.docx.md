Legacy is in opposition to curriculum

Thus toolkit's with learning potential rather than a set of things to learn

To cross reference this with my experience of a social toolset which is so wide that it looses fosuc as people go there own way and don't know how to share it back.

This is relevant as although there is some social sharing by using a shared piskel account, it is limited

**Article for time on Piaget**

Created 3fields of science,

Cognitive theory, epistemology and developmental psychology

**Gears of childhood**

Key quote , understanding learning must be genetic in origin

Thus the genesis forming of it via existing models or structures invokes question about how those underlying structures are formed and evolve.

Importance of affect, not in piagetian theory but is in constructionism. He loved the gears, physicality and individual exploration is inherently part of this love and shapes future work.

**Chapter 6 mindstorms**

Turtle as anthropological either floor or screen.

Piagets focus on the detail of what is being learned and bicycle example, compared to more psychologists concerns decontextualised from content,

For papert this is constrast of psychological and epistemological approaches.

Piaget, more interested in internal process as a theoretician, papert more intervention based, what can be most effective?

Define piagets epistemology, one to do with knowledge creation or growth, compared with other epistemologies concerning validity.

In describing possible interaction of mind structures to explain material conservation principle, the anthropomorphic agents of a height width and history are invoked. Defended as anthropomorphism as Progresion to mathematical exploration,

Deploring balkanisation of culture, but encouraging modularisation and mobility

Indeed turtle as an example, putting an accessible handle onto Newtonian physics.

Arcade physics as that handle in retro games.

Computational metaphors as a meta cognitive tool for young people to advance something. But what?

**Logo magazine**

General reflections on papert as accessible educator with community focus

And constructionism as teacher involving process, not anti teacher as may be implied from mindstorms

More Ignored in tech software circles as not product orientated, logo is reusable

**Maths article**

Oppositional constructs

One the power principle, what comes first getting it or doing it

Another project before problem , similar to above

Media and content, shift in media beyond paper needs a revolution in content

Thingness concept, object oriented approach,

Scratch precursor of micro worlds logo as blocks

Makes links to reification and includes references,

**A word for learning papert**

**Th**e heuristic guidelines like divide and conquer outlined have direct parallel with computational thinking.

What distinguishes them is the approach, firstly having a concrete micro work and a interest driven problem as part of a project,

Secondly a playful and relaxed approach to solving problem.

**Construction is chapters children's machine**

**Papert** laments discussion over universality of stages as a distraction from his extensive work studying the construction of knowledge in the concrete stage,

He outlines some of the wider areas

Both levi s and Piaget study concrete ways of thinking and describe them , ls in primitive and Piaget in children

But both place a primacy on the movement to abstract.

Papert cites latour as debunking this through studies of scientists in the west and turkle also sees concrete programming strategies as successful.

The societal danger of promoting such thinking is that we miss out on bricoleurs in certain sections of society pushing for more top down planners.

Piagets description o& the adaptive bricololeur and their associated intellectual methods is romantic in nature perhaps.

However it is pitched at a can do folksy farm yard level here. That shifts to a space programme only in materials used.

The underlying mental process is the same, and like all skills becomes familiar, comfortable or convivial as illich would say.l0

He mentions the privileged position of the written text and wonders if this will be changing with richer digital forms.

This media and knowledge pole is xplored in the maths oriented paper above.

**Computerists chapter**

The pole of hard and soft computing, with tale of visiting a Turing computer, equates hard with hardware and soft with abstraction to make computing more intuitive.

Compare this though to the notion of transparency. Too much hiding of underlying tech can reduce affordences for tinkering

However at too close to the processor, computational notation is also opaque, take little man computer with its focus binary processing in cpu

Now there is very much a lot of soft computing styles in creation of material,

Complex maths in Image processin\* in Adobe is invible

As Video editing

Use of mobile electronics to capture and network high quality media is present in every Facebook updates from phones

This appears to have gone too far, where is the sweet spot?

And if certain processes that were harder in papert day are now trivial with drag and drop , what is the genuine incentive of using more obscure, if transparent ways..

**Computer criticism vs technocratic thinking**

Highly critical of techno first thinking, also of scientism, and the methodology of isolating factors like the introduction of LOGO to schools from other more environmental aspects.

Especially relevant as Papert's prime concern of the introduction of computers is that it allows for radical new ways of learning about subjects. Thus multiple factors a necessity in observing change.

Arguing strongly for ethnographic approach - which he compares to the derogotory 'anecdoctal' word as a way of removing a reductionist approach.
