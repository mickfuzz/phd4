This is a huge area, but here are some links to some of my previous writing and note taking :

Draft of an assignment on pedagogy and game making (playing) - v3. Before restarting with a grounded focus only on the studies. [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1waoATfk\_KNuzEigstarfAjRxN\_DLBQ4b]{.underline}](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1waoATfk_KNuzEigstarfAjRxN_DLBQ4b)

This has info on some of the following domain specific analysis of the area of game playing and making.

-   Instructionism, educational games as a new ground for old learning     > theories

-   Learning Around the Game in Participatory Cultures - Gee / Jenkins -     > learning around the game playing in communities (value     > participatory culture) (Situated / Social Learning)

-   Epistemic games and approaches - Shaffer / Squire - thinking and     > doing as a professional (epistemic)- Cop

-   Constructionism - thinking with objects, sharing back (Situated /     > Social Learning)

-   Design approaches - resnick, roberson. Design based learning

Many of the non-instructional techniques have overlaps in the underlying educational theories.

-   Discovery Learning- Bruner Piaget

-   Constructivist / Constructionist approaches - Papert /

-   Sociocultural approaches - Vygotsky and school

-   Situated Learning and Cop - Lave Wegner

-   Situated Cognition - JS Brown, A Collins, P Duguid

-   Distributed Cognition - see Cole & Engestrom's take

In the replacement writing pedagogical elements are examined which are more specific observable and measurable outcomes. These covered in Earp's grounded review of game making studies, Collaboration, problems solving, creativity etc.

But there are links with slightly broader concepts which extend beyond learning outcomes, for example. Some of these are packed up into the approaches listed above.

-   Learner agency & control

-   Reflective processes to move tacit learning to more explicit

-   Ownership of process when working with assets they have created

-   Projecting into identities in game playing
