**Levels of Abstraction - in UK pedagogy and beyond - and compare CT approach to AT approach to abstraction**

Waite et al - Abstraction in action: K-5 teachers\' uses of levels of abstraction,

particularly the design level, in teaching programming

**LOA for coding in schools **

Abstraction - You can do it early.

Here are tools to help.

PGK framework - applied by various studies - described in

Seems not focused on primary pedagogy at all.

Waite at all do the work to make this more relatable with PRIMM as a framework

Which brings in the Use Modify Create framework too.

But I think this misses a trick in thinking about abstraction in a different way

See notes

-   High - overall mission of creating a game, fun to play, game for     > change

-   Middle - the choice of missions based on design patterns and then     > reflection using a map (perhaps the problem domain)

-   Low - implementation of the pattern via code

A pedagogy which supports a project based approach to coding will help learners to and teachers to navigate between these levels of abstraction.

Since the term levels of abstraction is already in use, we can turn to Activity Theory to help find a suitable alternative.

-   Activity

-   Action

-   Operation

This mapping is not quite appropriate - as operation is taken to be something which is a semi-automatic process.

**Other interpretations of Abstraction in Computing literature - more general**

Levels of abstraction in students' understanding of the concept of

algorithm: the qualitative perspective.

More general view - wide is user and product requirements, narrow is implementation.

So this wider view - is much larger than the PRIMM/ LOA interpretation which is really all on a level of algorithms very close to the machine.

We can really compare this with more folk / craft / design pattern approaches to coding - AND SHOULD - as a more authentic and relatable - and easier to navigate within a project based approach rather than a more abstract - algorithmic problem approach -

Danger of inert knowledge in the other approaches -
