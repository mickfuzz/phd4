*This writing is a potential extract from my literature review, as such,some concepts that would have previously explored in literature aroundgame playing and Digital Game-Based Learning will have already beenexplored. I will make reference to those in this extract when there is across over between the pedagogy of game playing and game making. *

Game Making and learning outcomes (and Pedagogy)================================================

In this extract of writing I will give an overview of the pedagogyexplored by researchers in area of digital game making.

Summary of some of the design principles and pedagogical principles atplay

Due to the complex environments of game making and the many possiblelearning processes at play it is not obvious how to dissect andcategorise them neatly in this way.

Instead I will look at research categorised by underlying educationalmotivations for making games in a learning context, namely;

the deep learning of subject content, creative and design approaches(specifically to understand making games), the technical skill ofsoftware coding, facilitating collaboration and communication, andfinally game making as an accessible way to promote access totechnology, particularly for girls.

By including any one study in these categories I do not wish to implythat it applies to this area exclusively. Kafai and Burke note thelimits of the simplicity of a similar categorisation in a review byHayes and Games. They note there is a lot of crossover in any suchdivisionKafaiand Burke, 2014). While acknowledging this limit, I propose that thisapproach it is a practical way to examine the details of research.

Before doing so, a look at the context of many of these studies on gamemaking .

Contextual Background (in Brief)--------------------------------

Studies on game making for eduction began at the start of the use ofspecialised computer programming languages, such as the text basedlanguage LOGO, aimed at young people and other beginners.

As has been explored in the introductory chapter (to be written), thefollowing pedagogical approaches are prevalent in the thinking behid thecontext of these studies; constructivist and constructionist approaches,discovery learning, situated learning and social-cultural approaches.Constructionist approaches, use of materials, diving in (linked tosituated learning) (Kafai and Resnick, 1996).

Game making as rich motivational activity with many potentialapplications due to project based nature.

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale &integration into schools of COTS games. see (Francis, 2006)

Games as a way to learn subject material across the curriculum--------------------------------------------------------------

A study of game making in scratch showed more computational conceptsused than other media making activitiesAdamsand Webster, 2012).

As definitions of computational thinking or learning become moresophisticatedGroverand Pea, 2013; Werner et al., 2014), and start incorporate elements ofsystems thinking, then there is an overlap with game design,

-   Abstractions and pattern generalizations (including models and    simulations)-   Systematic processing of information-   Symbol systems and representations-   Algorithmic notions of flow of control-   Structured problem decomposition (modularizing)-   Iterative, recursive, and parallel thinking-   Conditional logic-   Efficiency and performance constraints-   Debugging and systematic error detection

For a more in depth of the assessment of computational thinking and thelink with systems thinking, seeWerneret al., 2014).

In this analysis we students advance in their stystems thinking throughtheir understanding beyond the structural elements of systems to includebehaviour and functionHmelo-Silverand Pfeffer, 2004). More advanced students use mental model as an aid tocreate complex, dynamic responses to ill-formed problems. Werner et allnote that in game making we can see a link to the pedagogic approach ofproblem-based learning.

And wider still design thinking in education and studio thinkingHetlandet al., 2013; Hokanson, 2013; Hokanson and Gibbons, 2014). This linkwith arts based practice is made inDenhamand Guyotte, 2018). How much this is a useful contribution isquestionable, as there are perhaps more direct links with the generalprocess of design that are more closely related to the generation ofdigital artefacts,

We can also for example Resnick's take on iterative spiral designprocess linked to a kindergarden processResnick,2007).

Compare this to Roberson's design processesRobertsonand Nicholson, 2007)

The complexity of activities carried out in games can be seen as acommunity ecosystem similar to that of a workplace.

Game making and accessibility-----------------------------

While this is a wide title, it encompasses studies addressing race andgender. This is a problematic area in terms of accessing data. In areview Kafai and Burke note only 50% of studies include such data .

-   Girls Coding GCG-- Denner -- Storytelling Alice-   Roberston 2012 -- Adventure author-   Rapunsel -- Flannagan -- via Hayes and Games-   Black students game making and testing -- Glitch project -- diSalvo

Wider issue of of access to computers from disadvantaged communities.

Possibility to shift attitudes using games, Kafai cites Repenning butdata seems missing to support motivational claims, mostly anecdotal ?Repenning,2013; Repenning et al., 2015).

Less so in other study, there is survey data here.Ryooet al., 2013). and evidence of increased of take up in programme, but nocontrol?

There seems more convincing data in the Reynolds/ Globaloria data.Reynoldsand Chiu, n.d.)

Provoking collaboration, reflection, communication and other new literacies---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is a bit of a catch all, for wider C21, skillsBerminghamet al., 2013)

In an analysis of wider frameworksVoogtand Roblin, 2012), twenty first century skills have been summarised ascollaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social/cultural skills &citizenship, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving andproductivity/development of quality products. We can see that many ofthese skills have already been covered in our tour of the research ongame making as an educational activity. What we have left can be said tooverlap with the concept of multiple literacies.

In terms of group communication and collaboration, while research hashighlighted the potential of game making to encourage collaboration,there are comparatively few emprical studies available to support thisclaimEarpet al., 2013). .

We can see a direct link to studies surrounding game playing in the areaof the value of linking activities to promote reflection.

Concepts of mulitliteracies wider definitions of digital literacies, andstudies supporting this., and more specifically attempts to designlearning environments which support this kind of approach.

This is often linked to additional activities around the game. Geerefers to this as metagaming, (where?)

Discourses in this New Literacy context can comprise a wide variety ofcommunication forms to include "the burgeoning variety of text formsassociated with information and multimedia technologies"TheNew London Group, 1996, p. 61). In the context of computer games this isparticularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements whichmay including online play or internet forums which containconversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis,live chat possibilities and so on.

Kafai and Burke also look to embrace possibilities of online platformsthrough 'connected learning'Kafaiand Burke, 2015). They use a social lens highlight studies from Denneron pair programming as an effective social intervention in middle schoolDennerand Werner, 2007), and reference an study on peer interactions in gamecreation in LogoChingand Kafai, 2008). The later study builds on previous analysis of thelimits of teacher support in project based approaches, advocates morepeer interaction as a tactical response, and develops a model to allow aricher description of helping activities.

Itō documents the value of the informal nature of digital explorationsand identify play, and researches the resulting learning outcomesItō,2010). Diy media production and other meaning making in game playingcommunities are included in what been termed participatory cultureJenkins,2009). Any studies?

Discussion -----------

Some if not all of this should be in an introductory chapter.

Returning to the challenge context

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale forintegration of playing complex games in schoolsFrancis,2006).

These difficulties of application are in part why this study focuses onthe potential of a family learning environment to act as a moresupportive and flexible space for such complex learning.

In focusing on the area of family learning it is not my intention todisregard the potential for game making in more formal environments. Ido however wish to avoid an overly idealistic or realistic perspectiveon such potential which ignores the level of resources available toprimary and secondary schools. I feel that such an approach a moreresponsible approach to that of some of the advocates of digitalstrategies which seems to be belittling to schools or professionals notintegrating interactive, creative digital environments into theirclassrooms.

I return in this section to some of the previous studies to examine theissue of scalability and suitability of classroom integration to drawout particular contextual challenges.

I also wish to highlight the potential for family learning environmentsto address some or all of these issues.
