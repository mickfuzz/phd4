Game Making and Pedagogy========================

Contents--------

Leave to one side the debates around playing games and serious games andjustify this by making the case that the constructivist underpinning ofthe making activity better suits other activities. Do this by sumarisingsome of the key points to the last piece of writing.

Ideas of persona from Gee, projection and how this links to pedagog -link this to ideas surrounding writing in role for drama pedagogy.

Also bring in learner lead issues of autonomy and student centredlearning, links to hyper text theory.

Link to the potential of making games, how

Integrate the potential of family learning as an antidote to the limitsof integrating playing of computer games in to the school environment

Introduction & Background ( was game playing as a new form of literacy )------------------------------------------------------------------------

This writing traces the foundations and various influences of currentlandscape games and learning and the pedagogy behind this. Anchor thewriting with a reminder that I am focusing on family learning.

This school of approach is inspired by pioneering work by Gee and theNew Literacies movement. Gee was inspired by the complex learning oflanguage and other discourses that young people were engaging in byplaying video games.

Summary of some of the design principles and pedagogical principles atplay;

It is important to note that this writing does not address DBGL. Whilethis is an important area of study, especially later attempts to try tointegrate the tactics used by COTS game makers into educational/seriousgames, it is beyond the word count of this section, and will beaddressed separately.

In the final section I will contend that in integrating some of thebenefits of this use of games, making games is more suitable tointegration in to a collaborative, semi-formal process than that ofplaying games.

Game Play and complex activities--------------------------------

Gee also identified certain types of COTS games (including MMORGS --Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplay Games) which are complex, requirea significant investment in player time and are rich in learningpotential. Stewart outlines research which shows the development ofstrategy, media creation and maths in "crafting practices" in MMORGS2011,p. 111). Stewart terms this learning "Stealth Learning" and describes itan unintended learning which is hard to quantify or predict.

Explain this concept of unintended learning, or unfocused learning --some of this is complex and detailed, something that you would notassociate with twitch games of reactions.

and explain some of the issues surrounding the integration of this intoformal environments.

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale &integration into schools. see (Francis, 2006)

Learning around the Game------------------------

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale & the needfor linking activities to provoke reflection and this is echoed bypioneering studies (Torbin Turkle) seeFrancis,2006)

Discourses in this New Literacy context can comprise a wide variety ofcommunication forms to include "the burgeoning variety of text formsassociated with information and multimedia technologies"TheNew London Group, 1996, p. 61). In the context of computer games this isparticularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements whichmay including online play or internet forums which containconversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis,live chat possibilities and so on.

Itō documents the value of the informal nature of digital explorationsand identify play, and researches the resulting learning outcomesItō,2010). Diy media production and other meaning making in game playingcommunities are included in what been termed participatory cultureJenkins,2009).

An increasing number of studies explore such participation in computergames in a context of wider digital media literacy skillsBuckinghamet al., 2005).\SO WHAT. *I suspect this potential is not easily met in a schoolsetting, can we find evidence as to why in that document. *

Potential of Game Making------------------------
