*This writing is a potential extract from my literature review, as such,some concepts that would have previously explored in literature aroundgame playing and Digital Game-Based Learning will have already beenexplored. I will make reference to those in this extract when there is across over between the pedagogy of game playing and game making. *

Game Making and Pedagogy========================

In this extract of writing I will give an overview of the pedagogyexplored by researchers in area of digital game making.

Summary of some of the design principles and pedagogical principles atplay

Due to the complex environments of game making and the many possiblelearning processes at play it is not obvious how to dissect andcategorise them neatly in this way.

Instead I will look at research categorised by underlying motivationsfor making games in a learning context, namely; the deep learning ofsubject content, creative and design approaches (specifically tounderstand making games), the technical skill of software coding,faciliating collaboration and communication, and finally game making asan accessible way to promote access to technology, particularly forgirls.

The following pedagogical approaches will examined in context of thesestudies; constructivist and constructionist approaches, discoverylearning, situated learning and social-cultural approaches.

-   Constructionist approaches, use of materials, diving in (linked to    situated learning)    Kafai    and Resnick, 1996).

Below are more study situated examples these need to be mapped with theabove

-   NEED specific study? Papert and microworlds, locating a genesis of    situated thinking, constructionism, in comparison with piagets focus    on decontextualised abstract knowledge, see Ackerman and other    female authors in hard vs soft approaches -- Move on to CoP, how    evolved was that thinking? Find other studies which highlight the    situated nature of learning\...-   Constructionism -- as design approach - Justify a focus on specifics    of materials and activities - of later part of the writing -- as per    part 2? or a Resnick approach - Kafai -- study of game making in    computer club house-   More in line with formal approaches in this area is the rise of    computational thinking linked to tech industry and increasing    influence of tech heads, question the validity of the model as an    outreach tool promoting cross curricular work using computational    approaches,

    Parallel rise in creative design thinking, tinkering, diverse    materials, connecting and making

-   David gauntlet and DIY making, making as a way to pause for thought    before answering or discussing, particularly of interest in terms of    methods here    Gauntlett,    2007).

-   Design thinking and process - important especially in game making,    Action adventurer 3d - Robertson-   Systems thinking - link in game star mechanic, making as non-linear    approach. link to design / systems thinking    Kynigos,    2015).- and the teaching of not programming but the language of game    design    Salen,    2007).

Contextual Background ----------------------

While as Prensky (?) notes, interacting with digital technologies hasbecome more commons for younger digital natives, there are other skillsbeyond interaction that are a wider definition of digital fluencyKristianKiili et al., 2012).

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale &integration into schools of COTS games. see (Francis, 2006)

CROSS OVER HERE -- difficulty of integration of game making is similar -

FIND -- literature on the challenges of integrating Game Making intoschools.

These difficulties are in part why this study focuses on the potentialof a family learning environment to act as a more supportive andflexible space for such complex learning.

Making within games-------------------

Gee also identified certain types of COTS games (including MMORGS --Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplay Games) which are complex, requirea significant investment in player time and are rich in learningpotential. Stewart outlines research which shows the development ofstrategy, media creation and maths in "crafting practices" in MMORGS2011,p. 111).

Stewart terms this learning "Stealth Learning" and describes it anunintended learning which is hard to quantify or predict. It isimportant to make a distinction here between this approach and that of adefinition of stealth learning as learning not intended by theparticipant, the chocolate covered brocilli arguments of digital gamebased learning, an argument popularised by Prensky.

***E****xplain this concept of unintended learning, or unfocusedlearning ***--

It may be more acurate to describe the complex and at times unintendedlearning as situated learning or student led.

Games as a Making Activity--------------------------

There is scope for much more of this learning in making activities thangame playing activities, simply due to the technical complexity ofcreating a game which allows multiple learner paths.

Before returning to the kinds of learning that happen in the process ofgame making it is beneficial to explore the pedagogic characteristics ofthe recent emergence of making as a new learning movement.

The complexity of activities carried out in games can be seen as acommunity ecosystem similar to that of a workplace.

The work of Lave and Wegner around communities of practice. Explainconcept of legitimate peripheral participation

Provoking reflection, communication and other learning around game making-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can see a direct link to studies surrounding game playing in the areaof the value of linking activities to promote reflection.

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale & the needfor

This is preceeded by pioneering studies (Torbin & Turkle) seeFrancis,2006)

Discourses in this New Literacy context can comprise a wide variety ofcommunication forms to include "the burgeoning variety of text formsassociated with information and multimedia technologies"TheNew London Group, 1996, p. 61). In the context of computer games this isparticularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements whichmay including online play or internet forums which containconversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis,live chat possibilities and so on.

Itō documents the value of the informal nature of digital explorationsand identify play, and researches the resulting learning outcomesItō,2010). Diy media production and other meaning making in game playingcommunities are included in what been termed participatory cultureJenkins,2009).

An increasing number of studies explore such participation in computergames in a context of wider digital media literacy skillsBuckinghamet al., 2005).\SO WHAT. *I suspect this potential is not easily met in a schoolsetting, can we find evidence as to why in that document but again thisis contextual. *

Returning to the challenge of context-------------------------------------

In focusing on the area of family learning it is not my intention todisregard the potential for game making in more formal environments. Ido however wish to avoid an overly idealistic or realistic perspectiveon such potential which ignores the level of resources available toprimary and secondary schools. I feel that such an approach a moreresponsible approach to that of some of the advocates of digitalstrategies which seems to be belittling to schools or professionals notintegrating interactive, creative digital environments into theirclassrooms.

I return in this section to some of the previous studies to examine theissue of scalability and suitability of classroom integration to drawout particular contextual challenges.

I also wish to highlight the potential for family learning environmentsto address some or all of these issues.
