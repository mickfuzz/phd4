Game Making and Pedagogy========================

Contents v1-----------

Leave to one side the debates around playing games and serious games andjustify this by making the case that the constructivist underpinning ofthe making activity better suits other activities.

Do this by sumarising some of the key points to the last piece ofwriting.

-   Ideas of persona from Gee, projection and how this links to    pedagogy - link this to ideas surrounding writing in role, for drama    pedagogy and issues of learner identity and reducing anxiety?-   Also bring in learner lead issues of autonomy and student centred    learning?-   Link to the potential of making games -- from wider literature --    outlined below-   Integrate the potential of family learning as an antidote to the    logistical limits of integrating playing of computer games in to the    school environment

More directly look at the approach of my own learning design and breakdown some of the most interesting learning elements -- see chapter here-http://write.flossmanuals.net/learn-javascript-with-phaser/how-we-learn-javascript-in-this-book/

-   low anxiety environments for language learning, non-digital    approaches, student identity as projected identity -- I Games-   fast feedback and low threshold coding environments-   tech issues of simplifying coding structures, object orientated but    not abstract, and making as concrete and readable as possible-   Keeping the plug in -- social and reflective approaches to help    retention of material and reinforce positive learning loops

Just focus on making -- any link to playing ? ie complex environments?

Group by outcome? Rather than underlying pedagogical approaches

-   Subject matter knowledge, maths papert,-   Computational thinking-   Collaboration & communication-   Design processes, tinkering

However if you did want to list approaches, this could be...

linked to the underlying principles of constructivism. More specificallythe following

-   discovery learning,-   constructionist approaches, use of materials, diving in (linked to    situated learning)    Kafai    and Resnick, 1996).-   social learning,-   Situated Learning - including cop

Part of this writing is getting a flow of it together.

One approach, define terms, give examples of studies, outline results,then question validity of a particular study.

Another, define concepts, focus on one area in particular, then explainhow studies support or are limited in describing this area, propose aframework which evolves thinking.

-   Papert and microworlds , locating a genesis of situated thinking,    constructionism, in comparison with piagets focus on    decontextualised abstract knowledge, see Ackerman and other female    authors in hard vs soft approaches-   question, how much have constructionist studies been skewed by the    enthusiasm of research designers, we can find studies where    replication is less effective.-   For a flow -- start with contructivism, influence of constructionism    in game making context -- esp Kafai & Resnick --   Put this first? More in line with formal approaches in this area is    the rise of computational thinking linked to tech industry and    increasing influence of tech heads, question the validity of the    model as an outreach tool promoting cross curricular work using    computational approaches,-   Parallel rise in creative design thinking, tinkering, diverse    materials, connecting and making David gauntlet and DIY making,    making as a pause for thought.-   Justify a focus on specifics of later part of the writing -- as per    part 2? or a resnick approach --   Design thinking and system also important especially in game making,    link in game star mechanic, making as non-linear approach. link to    design / systems thinking    Kynigos,    2015).- and the teaching of not programming but the language of game    design    Salen,    2007). (check out the reading list here)-   Key studies by Cole used complex designs , mixing tech and playful    elements of role play, and emergent design changes cocreated with    participants, the **methods** of Mutual Appropriation -- and the    difficulty of replication -- could be linked to the microworlds    issue of replication too?

Introduction & Background ( was game playing as a new form of literacy )------------------------------------------------------------------------

While as Prensky notes, interacting with digital technologies has becomemore commons for younger digital natives, there are other skills beyondinteraction that are a wider definition of digital fluencyOttet al., 2012).

Summary of some of the design principles and pedagogical principles atplay;

It is important to note that this writing does not address DBGL. Whilethis is an important area of study, especially later attempts to try tointegrate the tactics used by COTS game makers into educational/seriousgames, it is beyond the word count of this section, and will beaddressed separately.

Game Play and complex activities--------------------------------

Gee also identified certain types of COTS games (including MMORGS --Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplay Games) which are complex, requirea significant investment in player time and are rich in learningpotential. Stewart outlines research which shows the development ofstrategy, media creation and maths in "crafting practices" in MMORGS2011,p. 111). Stewart terms this learning "Stealth Learning" and describes itan unintended learning which is hard to quantify or predict. This can becontrasted from a definition of stealth learning as learning notintended by the participant, the chocolate covered brocilli arguments ofdigital game based learning, an argument popularised by Prensky.

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale &integration into schools of COTS games. see (Francis, 2006)

CROSS OVER HERE -- difficulty of integration

Explain this concept of unintended learning, or unfocused learning --some of this is complex and detailed, something that you would notassociate with twitch games of reactions.

The complexity of activities carried out in games can be seen as acommunity ecosystem similar to that of a workplace.

The work of Lave and Wegner around communities of practice

The integration of this legitimate peripheral participation into formallearning environments is problematic for several reasons

-   time-   money-   authenticity

Learning around the Game -- CROSS OVER HERE-------------------------------------------

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale & the needfor linking activities to provoke reflection and this is echoed bypioneering studies (Torbin Turkle) seeFrancis,2006)

Discourses in this New Literacy context can comprise a wide variety ofcommunication forms to include "the burgeoning variety of text formsassociated with information and multimedia technologies"TheNew London Group, 1996, p. 61). In the context of computer games this isparticularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements whichmay including online play or internet forums which containconversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis,live chat possibilities and so on.

Itō documents the value of the informal nature of digital explorationsand identify play, and researches the resulting learning outcomesItō,2010). Diy media production and other meaning making in game playingcommunities are included in what been termed participatory cultureJenkins,2009).

An increasing number of studies explore such participation in computergames in a context of wider digital media literacy skillsBuckinghamet al., 2005).\SO WHAT. *I suspect this potential is not easily met in a schoolsetting, can we find evidence as to why in that document. *

Potential of Game Making------------------------

Having summarise some of the key pedagogical elements of game playinghow do these related to possibilities offered by game making?

Elements of User Control

Collaboration -

-   ability to move tacit knowledge to more explicit knowledge.
