**On Gaming Literacies & 3 discourses - from Salen and I.Games **

Games - proposes three dialogs, grounded based on 2 years of observational research and analysis of discourse / talk,

-   Material design

-   Ideal player

-   Real player

Salen - a broader take on many gaming literacies.

Salen, K. (2007). Gaming Literacies: A Game Design Study in Action. Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia, 16(3), 301--322.

Quite rambling in many ways - other work approaches gaming literacies not just from the perspecitive of making but also tive\ Does talk about multiple literacies - from Gee

Then different kinds of interaction jump out.

Human - human

Human - game

Human to game Input

These are then followed by what seems to be the prototype for the learner based framework that Torres and future work outlines.

> Game design models player interaction on several levels: > human-to-human > > interaction, human-to-technology interaction, human-to-game > interaction. > > • The **Core mechanics** are the experiential building blocks of > player interactivity, which represent the essential moment-to-moment > activity of the player, something that is repeated over and over > throughout the game. During a game, the core mechanic creates patterns > of behavior, and is the mechanism through which players > > make meaningful choices. Mechanics include activities like trading, > shooting, running, collecting, talking, capturing territory, etc. Game > design relies on the design of compelling, interactive core mechanics. > > • **Interaction between the player and an input device** allows the > player to control elements within the game space. Design of the input > device is connected to the design of the game interface, which > organizes information and allows a player to play the game. A game > interface can be simple or complex, but should always provide a player > with access to the elements and activities of the game. > > • **Interaction between different game components** is defined by > rules that describe what happens when these components interact. Does > the ball (component) bounce (rule) off the wall (component) or smash > (rule) a hole (object) in it?

**Starts in on game design**

> While it is very challenging to describe the fundamental principles of > > game design, an abbreviated list can help establish the groundwork for > an > > understanding of this highly interdisciplinary practice. Fundamentals > include > > understanding design, systems, and interactivity, as well as player > > choice, action, and outcome. They include complexity and emergence, > game > > experience, procedural systems, and social game interaction. Finally, > they > > include the powerful connection between the rules of a game and the > play > > the rules create, the pleasures games invoke, the ideologies they > embody, > > and the stories they tell.
