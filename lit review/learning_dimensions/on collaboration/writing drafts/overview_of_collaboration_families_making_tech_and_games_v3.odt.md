Overview of Collaboration in a Techy Family Learning Setting and Game Making  =============================================================================

In this writing I will to get guidance on how best to research the above beyond looking at research on family digital game making -- which is limited

To do this I'll step back from just game making studies to family making of wider tech.

This is partly due to limits in the research identified by Kafai saying collaboration in game making studies have focused on peer feedback and ? Rather than wider definitions.

The focus of this study is particular to family learning environments and thus studies with this as a context are needed.

This draws on more active research in the wider fields of maker movement and creative computing.

Problematising Collaboration -- and definitions -----------------------------------------------

It is useful to a wider context based on a few relevant areas of interest - collaboration and computer enhanced learning, arts tradition of collaboration DIY making following interpretations of Gaunlett and finally the perspective of Project Based Learning and approaches.

We can compare and contrast some of the takes on collaboration. And move towards a more precise take for this study of Collaborative Product or Creative Collaboration that centres around making something together.

Find a weak catch all definition of collaboration... perhaps 21^st^ skills -- use this as a jumping off point for more precise exploration.

The computer enhanced learning comes from an importance desire that learning via computers was not individualised by the technology used thus cutting learners off from valuable group insights Stahl et al., n.d.).

Dillenbourg comparison of cooperation and collaboration , sees cooperation as a jigsaw activity where indivduals take on parts of a wide task and work on them individually, compared to collaboration where the tasks are taken on together and meaning is collectively created Dillenbourg, n.d.).

In cooperation, partners split the work, solve sub-tasks individually and then assemble the partial results into the final output. In collaboration, partners do the work 'together.' (p. 8)

Rochelle and Teasley are more concerned with getting to grips with the processes of collaboration where computers are involved and refute the criticism of an isolationist approach Roschelle and Teasley, 1995). The co-construction of knowledge here is presented in the form of language, and use of other artefacts to both a) enable problem solving and b) use negotiating strategies to maintain a Joint Problem Space. These two activities are held to be essential and co-dependant. The authors present a framework for analysing these interaction; turn taking, socially distributed production (especially the completion of if-then proposals), repairs, narrations (talking aloud intentions in activity), language and action.

Definitions of 21^st^ Century Skills vary widely Binkley et al., 2009). In an analysis of wider frameworks Voogt and Roblin, 2012), twenty first century skills have been summarised as collaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social/cultural skills & citizenship, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and productivity/development of quality products. As such, many definitions include areas of design and systems thinking that we have already covered in this review of game making studies. Such overlaps is inevitable in this grounded approach to giving an overview of the concerns of the literature. This final section will concentrate on studies which include findings on issues of collaboration, communication and critical thinking.

Earp and colleagues take as a working definition of collaboration in KSAVE framework, which is encompasses team work and project planning.

Even, in terms of this wide scope of group communication and collaboration, while research has highlighted the potential of game making to encourage collaboration, Earp and al, conclude that "analysis of collaboration is mainly restricted to peer review and providing feedback", Earp et al., 2013).

This is a view echoed by Kafai and Burke (2015).

Kafai and Burke look to embrace possibilities of online platforms through 'connected learning' 2015). They use a social lens highlight studies from Denner on pair programming as an effective social intervention in middle school Denner and Werner, 2007), and reference an study on peer interactions in game creation in Logo Ching and Kafai, 2008). The later study builds on previous analysis of the limits of teacher support in project based approaches, advocates more peer interaction as a tactical response, and develops a model to allow a richer description of helping activities.

We know from research on game play how important collaborations are to motivate and sustain player's efforts to move ahead in the game. With the exception of the research on pair programming in making games (Denner & Werner, 2007; Werner, Denner, Bliesner, & Rex, 2009), we saw very few other studies include collaborative learning in their designs.

The above point of the need for more research in the areas of how learner maintain Joint Problem Spaces, and sustain each others motivation.

This writing will now progress to investage the linked ares of DIY making, creative computing and family learning to explore models used in these areas, with an aim to investiage their potential to apply to game making.

Collaboration in a Creative Computing Context - defining terms --------------------------------------------------------------

Collaboration has many meanings, we can turn to a 21^st^ Century skills for a working definition.

What I'm most interested in is collaborative production. The production of artefacts and meaning together. In this context the production by families of a text based game and the related assets that are part of the design process or just the ad-hoc working processes of families taking part.

We can turn the field of creative computing for a similar focus on the created assets and outputs of learning environments involving young people and particularly families

The Scratch community is used as a fertile testing group by key studies Roque et al., 2016b). Their implicit definition of creative collaboration in this study are project that involve young people using a community to make connections with each other to "connect, coordinate, and collaborate on projects and activities" Roque et al., 2016b, p. 4).

The case studies show pro-active members of the community engaging in remixing and competitions. The authours show the range of sophisticated technical and social processes that new users need to juggle in order to be an active member of collaborative Scratch projects or competitions. The studies which have described the processes are being used to design the next generation of features to better support users in these processes.

This can be compared with a more guided family process which is less pro-active and more scaffolded. See Roques Family Creative Learning programme Roque et al., 2016a).

There is a change of focus here from technical design of tools to the techniques used by adults in informal intergenerational learning environments Roque et al., 2012). Many have studied the youth, less so the adults. This study by Roque and Jain identified existing areas of interest including the use of guidance rather than direction from adults, drawing out user interests to bring into project work, and the identification of different roles adults play in this process. The study then turns to look at the process of development of these roles in adults. There are interesting case studies of students who volunteered to be facilitators Roque and Jain, n.d.).

Maria noted the importance of modeling a tinkerers mindset to families, Sam the balance between over and under facilitation, Alex felt proud at making good judgement calls about being a positive and constructive additions to a particular families 'learning dynamic n.d., p. 6)' as supported by Crowley and Brahms, 2016) who note the connections with people that participants build as they engage with making.

The design of Roque's programme is presented in in a very accessible format in this document.

And there are additional observations here.

The nature of Collaboration as part of Participatory Designs in a Family Context --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The field of Design Thinking and Participatory Design has yielded interesting results particularly in the area of informal science exploration and the co-creation of children's technologies Yip et al., 2013). The process of designing for other people draws on the promise offered by design thinking movement to create new objects, services or digital products. This has many strands but common themes include the importance attached to the following stages, ideation techniques stages building on user inspirations, iterative approaches involving the use of physical or testable prototypes, using of user testing to inform improvements to build empathy with the user's perspectives and experiences. The importance of empathy as a factor to facilitate better learning outcomes is also highlighted by Nash in Lor, 2017)

While the more traditional participatory design methods are aimed at commercial products and may not be suitable immediately for educational use, a little translation makes them applicable for designing formal curriculum design and informal interventions.

\ For examples, the importance of empathy and other communicative competencies are particularly promising for application in the field of informal family education according to Uchidiuno and colleagues Uchidiuno et al., 2017). For these researchers, design approaches takes on particular challenges and opportunities when viewed in a family context, including: the tendency for more informed participants to take a lead on collaborative processes, the need for young people to be build skills in both subject knowledge and design competency concurrently, Yip et al., 2013).

The results found value on the ideation stages, focus on empathy, and the iterative process. For example ideation helped to build knowledge of family learning roles and increase the bi-directional nature of helping relationships.

The importance of DIY Making, Critical Making & Reflective Spaces, Critical Participatory Design ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

David gauntlet and DIY making, making as a way to pause for thought before answering or discussing, particularly of interest in terms of methods here Gauntlett, 2007). Areas for accessibility here too.

Working with complex issues via Critical Making

The final concept I want to dip into in this smörgåsbord of autonomous learning processes is that of Critical Making Ratto, 2011). In Ratto's description Critical Making he values critical thinking as a possible outcome of the process of the social making objects. Thus widening the potential of 'objects to think with' beyond science and maths to encompass more civic concerns.

The author highlights a gulf between technical work and social work that critical making can bridge. More specifically, in the exploration of societal issues effected by technology. He finds use in a distinction between *caring about* an issue and a more informed *caring for* an issue informed by experience and a sense of responsibility. This stems from the reframing of our reality as designed rather than discovered. Thus shifting matters of fact (which can't be changed) into matters of concern where the outcome is at play Latour, 2008).

Ratto maps three, non-linear phases of Critical Making, exploration of existing areas (texts or ideas), making prototypes to reductively map such ideas and finally reflection and exploration of ideas through the revision of prototypes. The author links the process to three key elements of constructionism the possibility for emotional dimension of learning, the importance of transitional objects (projecting your self into objects to think with) and the value of 'messing about' to avoid constrictive working processes Papert, 1988).

In the exploration of two case studies the author recommends acknowledging and exploring the reductive nature of process of translating complex social issues into physical and digital models as a way of mitigating risks of over simplification discussions Ratto, 2011, p. 8).   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Participatory Design

Participatory Culture and Making around the Game ------------------------------------------------

Studies on game playing explore the value of linked creative activities that promote creative reflection through the creation and sharing of artefacts. (link to mulitliteracies)

In the context of computer games this is particularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements which may including online play or internet forums which contain conversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis, live chat possibilities and so on.

There have been attempts to design learning environments which support the acquisition of these related skills through engagement with additional activities around the game (have there? where?). Gee refers to this as metagaming, (where?)

Pioneering studies on metagaming activities (Torbin & Turkle) see Francis, 2006). Torbin, son managing a game site,

Itō documents the value of the informal nature of digital explorations and identify play, and researches the resulting learning outcomes Itō, 2010). Diy media production and other meaning making in game playing communities are included in what been termed participatory culture Jenkins, 2009). Any studies?

The importance of that sharing has been highlighted in face of platforms that only allow creation as opposed to sharing and interaction around creation Grimes and Fields, 2015).
