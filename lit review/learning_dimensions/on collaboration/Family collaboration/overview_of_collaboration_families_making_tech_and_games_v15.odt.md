Overview of Collaboration in a Techy Family Learning Setting and Game Making =============================================================================

The focus of this study is particular to family learning environments, collaborative production of artefacts and meaning. I am using constructivist and sociocultural perspectives. This writing aims to problematise definitions of collaboration, to describe methods of studying such collaboration and discuss resulting outcomes. Due to the wide range of contexts and methods covered this writing is only able to touch on underlying difference in methodologies briefly in the conclusion.

The research around collaborative processes and digital game making for learning is limited Earp, 2015; Kafai and Burke, 2015). Earp and colleagues note "analysis of collaboration is mainly restricted to peer review and providing feedback" 2013, p. 2), with the focus on most studies being on learner attitudes, subject knowledge or skill acquisition Bermingham et al., 2013). As a practical response, this writing widens in focus to include the related fields pair programming, creative computing, physical making and tinkering and intergenerational participatory design.

A common theme associated with game making programmes is that they support the development of 21^st^ Century Skills . Definitions of 21^st^ Century Skills vary widely Binkley et al., 2009). In an analysis of wider frameworks Voogt and Roblin, 2012), twenty first century skills have been summarised as collaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social/cultural skills & citizenship, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and productivity/development of quality products. As these terms are complex and complementary Kickmeier-Rust and Albert, 2012), I will explore the term collaboration, to better situate particular aspects of collaboration most relevant to this study.

Collaboration can be conflated with group work. In a review of research on group work Cohen, 1994), collaboration is seen as a desirable, social outcome of such group work in line with sociocultural approaches. The author notes that effective learning designs are need to prevent work which could be done individually being assigned to a group, changing little but the seating arrangement. She suggest the use of "ill-structured tasks" 1994, p. 4), which have many possible, as a way to ensure effective team working.

A broad conception of collaboration is shared by Resnick in the context of creation of online coding projects 2007). He references the concept of Participatory Culture advanced by Jenkins where people share created or appropriated a wide variety of digital artefacts on using various forms of internet, but most commonly specific sharing and social media sites including YouTube, Flickr and Facebook where the work is viewed by other users, often forming the basis for comments and conversations. In the context of sharing programmable media and games, the result is a "collaborative community" 2007, p. 4), where users can borrow and build upon the work of others.

The field of computer enhanced learning has explored collaborative learning in depth, partly as a response to the danger that technology individualises learning, thus cutting learners off from valuable group insights Stahl et al., n.d.). Dillenbourg compares cooperation and collaboration, seeing cooperation as a jigsaw activity where individuals take on parts of a wide task and work on them individually, compared to collaboration where the tasks are taken on together, at the same time (synchronously) and meaning is collectively created Dillenbourg, 1999).

In cooperation, partners split the work, solve sub-tasks individually and then assemble the partial results into the final output. In collaboration, partners do the work 'together.' (p. 8)

Similarly, Rochelle and Teasley explore processes involved in face-to-face collaboration where learners are undertaking joint problem solving involving computers 1995). The co-construction of knowledge here is presented in the form of language, and use of other artefacts to both a) enable problem solving and b) use negotiating strategies to maintain a Joint Problem Space. These two activities are held to be essential and co-dependant. The authors present a framework for analysing these interaction; turn taking, socially distributed production (especially the completion of if-then proposals), repairs, narrations (talking aloud intentions in activity), language and action. The researchers noted the use of the computer by learners as a way of disambiguating language with reference to something more concrete on the screen.

These variances in the interpretations of the term collaboration provide a bases for analysis of studies of areas of practice. The following sections take a closer look at studies on participant collaboration in domains related to the target field of family game making. A discussion section follows outlining tensions and areas for fruitful future research.

Capturing Pair and Peer Programming ------------------------------------

While many similar studies looking at the kind of dyad learning involved in pair programming and statistical analysis of academic results compared to individual study McDowell et al., 2002; Mullins et al., 2011; Nagappan et al., 2003), fewer exist which capture the processes of collaboration. Denner, Werner and colleagues undertook two studies on pair programming as an effective social intervention in middle school to increase programming knowledge using the Flash multimedia and Storytelling Alice tool Denner and Werner, 2007; Werner et al., 2013, 2009). The earlier study using Flash used journals and audiotape transcriptions. In journals students were asked to reflect on how they solved problems. Audio tape transcripts were analysed to identify patterns of pair interactions. Emerging patterns include; problem identification and debugging which highlight the need to agree on a shared understanding of the nature of the problem, resource signposting and highlighting the difference between working code and non-working examples sometimes using 'playful interaction' as a strategy to mitigate frustrations Denner and Werner, 2007, p. 146). Results also found that the pair interactions were are times problematic leading to frustration in of themselves if partners did not interact well Denner, 2007).

The later study used statistical analysis of dyad interaction over time across multiple time points Werner et al., 2013, p. 4). The results find computer confidence to most significant factor in improvement in programming knowledge compared to difference in previous knowledge of the software environment used and friendship factors.

Ching and Kafai 2008) undertook a scale study on peer interactions in environmental simulation creation by elementary children using the programming language Logo. They developed a model to allow a richer description of helping activities, particularly those of collaborative socialisation and peer guidance. Their framework describing collaborative mentoring roles was created based on video and audio recording of iterations between teams of forth graders who were tasked with creating simulations and fifth graders tasked to support others students. It describes group organisation, initiation processes and outlines help strategies used.

Group organisation of the teams involved is characterised as being mainly either clustered around one computer with teams communicating intensively about the same problem, or as independent work on different aspects of the group task. Hence, following Dillenbourg 1999) clustered work would be characterised as collaboration and independent work cooperation. However Kafai and Ching note the on-going importance of communication between independent workers who were with in earshot and often shared computers at key moments. This complicates the previously explored distinction between cooperation and collaboration, as although working separately, team members are maintaining a line of synchronous communication to maintains some kind of joint understanding of the emerging problems at hand.

Figure.2 below shows a top tier of how teams configured themselves and a middle teir consisting of how interactions between four and fifth graders came about. Interactions are started by either namely periodic monitoring by fifth graders, responding to questions asked by four graders or immediate intervention by fifth graders when problems are identified. Finally in the bottom tier characterises the nature of the help strategies of the fifth graders consisting of suggesting new directions, dialogue to aid learner understanding, direction based on interaction and intervention to fixing code problems.

![](./Pictures/100000000000036B00000192BA71381E1E21595A.png){width="17cm" height="7.809cm"}The results of this study advocated a prescriptive approach to pair / peer interaction as a tactical response to the often intensive demands on teacher time when classes are engaged in coding tasks. While there is clearly value to the framework to address in more detail some of the complexities of the different configurations and patters of helping behaviour, some of the most interesting findings point to some of the unanswered questions brought up by the research. Specifically, what is the thinking of older students when choosing helping strategies, and how to best support and scaffold their learning in that process. The authors note that these issues may be informed to apprenticeship and sociocultural approaches Rogoff, 1993; Wenger, 1998). Whilst acknowledging the difficulty of bringing apprenticeship practices into schools, they feel that the intervention studies has a great potential to be replicated and advanced.

Creative Computing -------------------

In this context Creative Computing is a broad term for the exploration of tools and practices around making diverse artefacts with multimedia software allowing programming and easy to use electronics. The term is used by a school of researches and designers clustered around the MIT Media Lab and their work stemming from pioneering work on the LOGO programming language by Seymour Papert 1980). One of their most visible and researched tool is currently Scratch. Scratch is free desktop and web software used to support coding of games and other media projects. It uses coloured code blocks rather than a text based approach, allows incorporation of a wide variety of media and has an online community for sharing created works. It is productive to look at some of the research and researchers that make up the Scratch community as a way of exploring some of the different threads of research around collaboration using this tool.

As previously mentioned, Resnick explores Scratch as a tool allowing the the sharing of user created artefacts. A Scratch creation is open by default, allowing other users of the site to click on a *See Inside* button to view the code blocks used to construct it. Resnick highlights the collaborative potential offered by the Scratch toolset. Specifically, the abilities to remix programmable media, to form production teams, and give each other feedback 2007).

Many of Resnick's papers focus on design considerations or technical considerations to lower the barriers to engage in programming Resnick et al., 2009, 2005; Resnick and Silverman, 2005), Others focus on the user experience use individual anecdotes of actual use Brennan et al., 2010; Resnick, 2012).

Their is the danger that as an enthusiastic advocate of Scratch as a tool, Resnick is cherry picking user stories in an unrepresentative way. SO CAUTION ABOUT TAKING THESE CLAIMS AT FACE VALUE BUT OTHER STUDIES ARE OUT THERE. FIND AN OPPOSITIONAL ONE OR TWO.

More extensive and complimentary studies focusing on user collaboration in the online Scratch community have been carried out by Resnick's colleagues Fields et al., 2014, 2013; Hill and Monroy-Hernandez, 2013; Roque et al., 2012).

A study by Roque and colleagues shows pro-active members of the community engaging in remixing and competitions 2012). The authors describe the range of sophisticated technical and social processes that new users need to juggle in order to be an active member of collaborative Scratch projects or competitions. However, examination of log files on the platform server show that only a small minority of users are involved in such collaborative processes Fields et al., 2014). To counter this disparity of use Roque and colleagues have explored strategies around the creation of learning designs and structures around coding events and competitions to support the development of the social behaviours which help collaboration within the online community 2016b),

Beyond this focus on online support, and with a mind to the problems of inequality of access to such a participatory culture, Roque later shifted focus to develop facilitated creative processes in out of school, family learning settings 2016). The programme in question, Family Creative Learning, drew on the technical capability of Scratch to allow users to incorporate diverse media materials to make the project personal, and thus increase motivation and identification with project. In two iterations of a four session programme, Parents and children used of physical computing tools, namely the easy to use sensor kit Makey Makey, as well as non-digital materials and activities to lower barriers to participation and build collaborative capacities of learners before non familiar digital task. Data collection comprised video data of interactions, facilitator field notes and interviews with participant and facilitators. This study is significant as the level of detail that parents, children and facilitators were able to share in interviews and the triangulation possible with video recording and field notes allow for a richer interpretation of learning experience offered by case studies focused around artefacts offered in other Scratch studies Resnick, 2012).

The experience of young people, parents and facilitators was analysed using Barron's framework of parental roles to support learning with technology 2009). Significal behaviours identified in parents included, collaborating with children, learning from children, brokering other learning opportunities, providing non-technical support and access to technical resources. Roque identifies the adoption of parental roles as temporary, with participants shifting between them and moving into new roles over the course of programme 2016a). The use of non-digital activities, crafting activities had potential for parents to connect to previous competencies and identities in a way that reduced anxiety surrounding working with new technologies. In addition such activities helped make coding processes concrete for participants facilitating the construction of shared language and understandings.

Interviews with volunteer facilitators proved useful to identify helping behaviours to support the development of parent interactions Roque and Jain, 2018). Maria noted the importance of modelling a tinkerers mindset to families (a concept explore later). Sam noted his development of a sense of the balance between over and under facilitation. Alex felt proud at making good judgement calls about being a positive and constructive additions to a particular families 'learning dynamic' resulting from the building of a relationship which allowed him to learn about participants interests and drivers 2018, p. 6).

The shifting roles observed in FCL may indicate a level of sophistication that is hard to replicate. While this study, used facilitators to identify, praise and therefore encourage various roles, these observations also brings to the fore one of the dilemmas facing learning designs which encourage collaborative work. While it may be tempting to structure, formalise and instruct participants on their roles in collaboration, a process favoured by processes such as reciprocal teaching, as Dillenboug points out such restrictions remove the valuable aspect of negotiating roles from the collaborative process 1999).

A self-reported limitation of the study are that the parents involved all had at least one parent who had a positive predisposition to the use of technologies for creative purposes. In addition to this, the high level of support from a large team of facilitators in the process and low participant numbers would make this a difficult programme to scale up and roll out.

Tinkering & Making in Makerspaces ---------------------------------

I want to acknowledge the complexities involved in terms making and tinkering associated with the Maker Movement Vossoughi and Bevan, 2015). However for the purposes of this writing give a broad definition as activities as the making and sharing physical objects as a non-professional activity.

In a series of three case studies on adult focused Makerspaces, Sheridan describes them as communities of practice 2014), where legitimate peripheral activity of new comers allows them to survey, and gradually actively participate in the activities of the space. The important consideration here in terms of participation and collaborations between community member is that it is unregulated and open, especially in contrast more prescriptive, instruction based approaches.

Making and tinkering is also popular in the context of informal and youth oriented exploration of STEM content material and contexts such as science museums. Crowley and Brahms describe museum making spaces as distinct from traditional interactive exhibits in their material use of real tools, loose parts and presence of skilled facilitators 2016).

The authors acknowledge established frameworks of design principles that attract, hold and communicate to families in museums Borun and Dritsas, 1997) but contend that they should be expanded to encompass the complex processes occurring between families and facilitators over time. The authors underline the need to expanding the unit of time in analysis of the kind of learning happening. The research methods they use reflect this focus, specifically in-depth case studies involving extensive documentation and semi-structured interviews with young visitors and their family members they focus on a trajectory of learners over many visits.

In making spaces tinkering often begins immediately using prototypes with no formal needs analysis of the product. In their review of tinkering and making, Vossoughi and Bevan explore tensions surrounding use of materials which is lowers barriers to entry for participants yes not be too limiting technically, which provides immediate feedback but can involve a wide range of materials or genres 2015). Bevan and colleagues at the Exploratorium museum in San Fransciso have developed a framework which explores the social aspects of tinkering Bevan et al., 2015). The framework is a product of in-depth analysis of video recordings and conversations between participants as the interact with tinkering museum exhibits. Of the four categories identified in their learning dimensions framework, while one one, social scaffolding, explicitly explored collaboration as a outcome of the process, the others, engagement, initiative and dimensions of understanding, are all measured in the context of communication happening in the context of collaborative activities. As such, the indicators used to locate the learning dimensions are social rather than cognitive in focus, drawing on Vygotskian concepts of expansive conceptions of learning which the authors describe as moving "beyond tradition school-like conceptions (knowing), beyond traditional constructivist conceptions (doing), to include conceptions of the socially and situated developing self (being and becoming)" 2013).

Advocates of Making as an educational activity have concerns that attempts to ingrate the success of the Maker Movement practices into a more formal setting may result in a degradation of value.

We can contrast the more experimental side of the maker movement with the more instructional kit assembly approaches. Repetitive making based on preset instructions or temptation towards 'trivial fabrication' fails to exploit potential problem solving and design challenges latent in the materials Blikstein, 2013).

While there is compelling evidence for the appeal of tools for tinkering, we can argue that the selection of the materials, while still providing creative opportunities, guides participants towards certain outcomes. This argument is particularly strong in the case of "Making Kits" which have become a output of the broader maker movement. These kits can be bought as off the shelf products which have an aesthetic of backyard inventor, but which are predilected in terms of the possible outcomes, essentially providing a return to following instructions to create a predetermined product.

The issue of the assumed goals surrounding making and tinkering is identified in a review of literature on tinkering by Bevan and Vossoughi 2015, p. 40). While concepts of "innovation" and "global competiveness" which drive some STEM programmes can be seen as uncontroversial aids to economic development, different motives for STEM programmes are identified, some driven by an empowerment agenda, others semi-militarised Vossoughi and Vakil, 2018).

One of the dangers of not exploring the hidden values in these often STEM focused programmes are the implications for broad participations.

The white men issue of making needs to be addressed Grenzfurthner and Schneider, 2009; Halverson and Sheridan, 2014).

Participatory Design & Collaborative Inquiry --------------------------------------------

Resnick explicitly characterises the immediacy of tinkering compared to 'planning' 2013), and Brahms explores the attractive nature of Maker materials and processes within the context of a museum's need to draw their audience into immediate interaction with their exhibition spaces. In this section I compare this approach to the more context sensitive approach of more traditional design methods. The design process has many strands but common themes include the importance attached to the following stages, ideation techniques stages building on user requirements, iterative approaches involving the use of physical or testable prototypes and integrating user testing to inform improvements Flanagan et al., 2005; Scaife and Rogers, n.d.).

Participatory Design (PD) involves users extensively in ideation and planning stages and involves techniques to make values present in the design process and product explicit Schuler and Namioka, 1993). While the majority of PD methods are aimed at commercial products or public services, the exploration of values, empathy, and user experience facilitate better learning designs is also suited to improving educational designs and technologies Bonsignore et al., 2013).

Collaborative Inquiry (CI) is an adapted thread of PD focused the specific context of the co-creation of children's technologies Druin, 1999; Guha et al., 2013; Yip et al., 2013). It comprises three key aspects of a close research partnership with children, use of naturalistic methods to gather contextual data in-situ and the user of PD low-tech, craft based prototyping techniques to intergeneration participants communicate new ideas on a level playing field Druin, 1999). A common PD concerns is that participants often struggle to articulate their needs in the process of design Beyer and Holtzblatt, 1997), and thus CI identified the desirability for at least some of the young people involved in the process to have built competencies in the design processes involved previously 2013).

Uchidiuno and colleagues used CI to develop technology to help STEM learning informal family settings via the creation of the Science Everywhere application Uchidiuno et al., 2017). In prototyping sessions they used extensive video recordings, participant observation via note taking and post session semi-structured interview with participants. The results highlight the role of empathising to open productive explorations of the context of the family learning environment and the value of offering guidance, particularly to parents, in terms of adopting collaborative roles to ensure equal participaton. They also found the iteration process of the design surfaced patters which helped to build knowledge of family learning roles and increase the bi-directional nature of helping relationships.

Discussion ----------

The purpose of this discussion section is to identify synergies and divergent approaches in the studies described above which may be productive to explore in the context of my future research on collaboration in family game making.

Empphasis of tools over Processes

This shift in focus is notable in the research described surrounding Scratch, creative computing and creative making activities. The initial research and associated literature often focuses on design aspects and the affordances of construction toolsets. The tone is positivistic in that the tools are often presented as a gateway to STEM knowledge. Such an approach may be explained by the influence of funders as such programmes are often initially researched by the team that is funded to design them, as is the case with Scratch which was funded INFORMATION ON SCRATCH FUNDING . The underlying message is that it is easy and fun to learn science with these kits. We can see a parallel here to the funding for making programmes detailed above and the danger of the hidden values of the approach being transmitted.

It is not my intention to say that communities of researcher / designer teams like that of Scratch are unaware of such issues. Indeed, the broad consensus of the studies above, often from members of the design team, is that a "built it and they will come" strategy, i.e. one which focuses only on physical toolset and software tools is not optimal. This holds even when the potential of tools is expressly creative and social (as in the online Scratch community). The challenge of progression and deeper participation in online making communities are explored by many of the researchers above. Kafai noted surprise at the little interset shown by their participants making Scratch games in the creations of others in the online community 2016). Similarly Martin sees as 'fatally flawed' 2015, p. 37) tendencies in the Maker Movement to foreground tools rather than the holistic processes and identity development highlighted in the studies explored above. Martin notes that this concern is most apparent when making tools are simplistically incorporated school curriculums. Noting that this pattern reflects Cuban's 2003) critique of the simplistic introduction of other technology into schools.

**Complexity of Roles & Scaling -**

Roque makes a convincing case for the unpicking of the supportive and collaborative roles of parents and facilitators to build this capacity and awareness of family learning roles. However, while the design of the FCL programme was effective to build parental confidence and increase overall accessibility, it left questions about the effectiveness of the process to enable learning at home.

We can compare the difficulties of scaling of this hybrid setting (FCL) with more structured, and more naturalistic learning environments. It can be tempting to see the process of hanging out line in the frame of Ito's online and social participation in informal communities as infinitely replicable. Such online communities are out there. It is up to learner to navigate and extract learning and skills as they see fit.

In these more naturalistic settings, Ito and colleagues note that generative activities are the exception rather than norm even in expressly creative communities 2010). Productive partnerships in communities like Scratch are extremely rare compared to false starts. Studies of the New Grounds site which has a similar aim of creating media collaborations, via collabs, showed a 80 percent failure rate of collaborative projects Luther et al., 2010).

On the other end of the spectrum is the desire to bring open-ended practices into the school setting. We see that a similar pattern in different communities -- ABOVE IN MAKING - SCRATCH IN SCHOOLS While the focus of my study will be on family learning, due to the need for strategies to bring game making into schools settings, which I will address this issue. Kafai's study detailing an emergent peer pedagogy, accepts some of the limits of the school setting but identifies peer practices that show great promise.

Overall challenge of promise of Participatory Culture - In one regard the kind of collaboration seen in PC could be seen a much more individualised process than the collective or cooperative work described by Dillenbourg, more of community participation than actually collaboration. However such an interpretation would neglect the possibilities of online tools and processes to facilitate the kind of Joint Problem Space described earlier. Examples of tools and communities that successfully manage this type of asynchronous but detailed collaboration on specific task are wiki communities for collaborative writing Forte and Bruckman, 2007), using a wiki to develop language skills Kessler and Bikowski, 2010), and use of distributed code authoring tools to build open source software Dabbish et al., 2012). The educational value offered by the collaborative possibilities online tools provide are still in the process of being evaluated and integrated into more formal learning settings Zagalsky et al., 2015). Their distributed and asynchronous nature provide both opportunities and challenges, .\

The tension between autonomous participation in a naturalistic on structured facilitated support is one that is also explored in the extensive literature exploring project based approaches. Here advocates of this approach promote the value of open-ended, authentic projects while critics highlight that without support that collaboration is difficult between learners and thus needs to be scaffolded with structured activities and taught input, Kirschner et al., 2006; Kollar et al., 2006). I mention this as the literature surrounding the mature field of Project Based Learning may be a good source of inspiration for tactics to address issues of scaling and replicability of game making education projects.

SUMMARY **Methods of interest for my study / Summary for future directions**

It is worth observing briefly that the general direction of travel on all of the areas above is from a focus on more personal conceptions of knowledge towards more socio-cultural understandings. However, the focus on the motivational factors of the sharing created artefacts in communities can still said to be key to personal view of learning Fosnot, 1993), is still present at times in the over-focusing on tools, or the capabilities for sharing tools. This reflects a key tension in Constructivist theory is between Fosnot's focus on the value of sharing artefacts as active representation and personal cognitive development and the more socio-cultural focus on the ongoing transmission and negotiation of meaning and values through social context over time O'loughlin, 1992). More detail on this is beyond the remit of this piece but worth exploring in other writing.

In their exploration of studies game making to enhance creativity Eow et al., 2010, 2010; Kangas, 2010; Robertson and Nicholson, 2007), Earp and team find that the few studies carried out show the potential for creative thinking when student are given access to co-production processes and other tools to support creative thinking. The authors conclude that research methods to assess creativity and collaboration in the field of game making are lacking despite the very nature of roles involved of programming, artists and designer making game making inherently cooperative 2013).

I am keen to involved, playful use of games and accessible construction materials to aid the creative process, lowering barriers to participation and help build confidence develop the identities of participant as makers and creators. The interaction between physical and digital aspects of the making processes is of great interest to me.

The exploration of the value of online communities is striking in the literature explore above. While the technologies used could facilitate an interesting study of asynchronous contributions to a text-code game over time, there are some issues. Firstly, they are likely to be working on their project mostly while in the same physical space. Secondly, online intra-family collaboration outside of the taught sessions would require a high level of learner autonomy Kessler and Bikowski, 2010), which is not predicted or required for participation in the proposed programme.

Of much greater interest to build on studies where the the value of face-to-face facilitation of family interactions is explored from multiple perspectives using a variety of methods as in the work of Roque and Bevan and colleagues described above Bevan et al., 2015; 2016). What is notable about both of these studies is the value placed on the reflections of professional and volunteer facilitators of the family learning process. Since reading these studies I would be keen to consider bringing this perspective into my research.

Some of the studies either explicitly mention activity theory, or clear lay reference the surrounding social concerns of the importance of community, division of labour and rules of participation. I'm most interested in how these learning systems can be set up quickly from zero with diverse families involved. What are points of friction, of harmonising of collaborative processes , points of divergence and convergence of goals and identities?

The positioning of these interactions as a system is potentially fruitful for a number of reasons. In previous writing, I explored research on the value of game making to engender systems thinking Tekinbaş et al., 2010; Torres, 2009). When examined through the participatory lens of CI, I wonder what impact can this emerging knowledge regarding game as systems have on the formation of an emerging system of a community of family game makers? Specifically, is there are positive value in comparing the systems of the games
