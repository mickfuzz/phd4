Overview of Collaboration in a Techy Family Learning Setting and Game Making =============================================================================

The focus of this study is particular to family learning environments, collaborative production of artefacts and meaning. I'll be using constructivist / sociocultural perspectives. This writing aims to problematise definitions of collaboration, to describe methods of studying such collaboration and discuss resulting outcomes

The literature around collaboration and digital game making is limited Kafai and Burke 2015) In a review Earp and colleagues note "analysis of collaboration is mainly restricted to peer review and providing feedback" 2013, p. 2). As a practical response, this writing widens in focus to include in the wider fields of research including; pair programming, creative computing, the maker movement, participatory design, and more specific look at values-informed making cultures.

A common theme of advocate of game making programmes is that they support the development of 21^st^ Century Skills Earp etc . Definitions of 21^st^ Century Skills vary widely Binkley et al., 2009). In an analysis of wider frameworks Voogt and Roblin, 2012), twenty first century skills have been summarised as collaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social/cultural skills & citizenship, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and productivity/development of quality products. This section will explore the term collaboration, which is rather imprecise term to better situate particular aspects of collaboration most relevant to this study.

Collaboration can be conflated with group work. In a review of research on group work, Cohen, 1994) collaboration is seen as a desirable, social outcome of such group work in line with sociocultural approaches. The author notes that effective learning designs are need to prevent work which could be done individually being assigned to a group, changing little but the seating arrangement. They suggest the use of ill structured tasks, which have many possible , as a way to ensure effective team working.

A similar issue has been explored in the field of computer enhanced learning to address the potential that learning may be individualised by the technology, thus cutting learners off from valuable group insights Stahl et al., n.d.). In this seeting, Dillenbourg compares cooperation and collaboration, seeing cooperation as a jigsaw activity where individuals take on parts of a wide task and work on them individually, compared to collaboration where the tasks are taken on together and meaning is collectively created Dillenbourg, n.d.).

In cooperation, partners split the work, solve sub-tasks individually and then assemble the partial results into the final output. In collaboration, partners do the work 'together.' (p. 8)

Rochelle and Teasley are more concerned with getting to grips with the details of processes of collaboration where computers are involved Roschelle and Teasley, 1995). The co-construction of knowledge here is presented in the form of language, and use of other artefacts to both a) enable problem solving and b) use negotiating strategies to maintain a Joint Problem Space. These two activities are held to be essential and co-dependant. The authors present a framework for analysing these interaction; turn taking, socially distributed production (especially the completion of if-then proposals), repairs, narrations (talking aloud intentions in activity), language and action. The researchers noted the use of the computer by learners as a way of disambiguating language with reference to something more concrete on the screen.

A broader conception of collaboration is shared by Resnick in the context of creation of online coding projects 2007). He references the concept of Participatory Culture advanced by Jenkins where people share created or appropriated a wide variety of digital artefacts on using various forms of internet, but most commonly specific sharing and social media sites including YouTube, Flickr and Facebook where the work is viewed by other users, often forming the basis for comments and conversations. In the context of sharing programmable media and games, the result is a "collaborative community" 2007, p. 4), where users can borrow and build upon the work of others. In one regard this kind of collaboration could be seen a much more individualised process than the collective or cooperative work described by Dillenbourg, more of community participation than actually collaboration. However such an interpretation would neglect the possibilities of online tools and processes to facilitate the kind of Joint Problem Space described earlier. Examples of tools and communities that successfully manage this type of asynchronous but detailed collaboration on specific task are wiki communities for collaborative writing Forte and Bruckman, 2007), using a wiki to develop language skills Kessler and Bikowski, 2010), and use of distributed code authoring tools to build open source software Dabbish et al., 2012). The educational value offered by the collaborative possibilities online tools provide are still in the process of being evaluated and integrated into more formal learning settings Zagalsky et al., 2015). Their distributed and asynchronous nature provide both opportunities and challenges, .

These variances in the interpretations of the term collaboration provide a bases for analysis of studies of areas of practice. The following sections take a closer look at studies on participant collaboration in domains related to the target field of family game making. A discussion section follows outlining tensions and areas for fruitful future research.

Capturing Pair Programming and Collaborative Coding ---------------------------------------------------

Denner, Werner and colleagues undertook two studies on pair programming as an effective social intervention in middle school to increase programming knowledge using the Flash multimedia and Storytelling Alice tool Denner and Werner, 2007; Werner et al., 2013, 2009). The earlier study using Flash used journals and audiotape transcriptions. In journals students were asked to reflect on how they solved problems. Audio tape transcripts were analysed to identify patterns of pair interactions. Emerging patterns include; problem identification and debugging which highlight the need to agree on a shared understanding of the nature of the problem, resource signposting and highlighting the difference between working code and non-working examples sometimes using 'playful interaction' as a strategy to mitigate frustrations Denner and Werner, 2007, p. 146). Results also found that the pair interactions were are times problematic leading to frustration in of themselves if partners did not interact well Denner, 2007).

The later study used statistical analysis of dyad interaction over time across multiple time points Werner et al., 2013, p. 4). The results find computer confidence to most significant factor in improvement in programming knowledge compared to difference in previous knowledge of the software environment used and friendship factors.

While many similar studies looking at the kind of dyad learning involved in pair programming and statistical analysis of academic results compared to individual study McDowell et al., 2002; Mullins et al., 2011; Nagappan et al., 2003), fewer exist which capturing the processes of collaboration. One exception is a study by Ching and Kafai 2008) on peer interactions in environmental simulation creation by elementary children using the programming language Logo. They develop a model to allow a richer description of helping activities, particularly those of collaborative socialisation and peer guidance. Their framework describing collaborative peer roles was created based on video and audio recording of iterations between forth graders who were tasked with creating simulations and fifth graders tasked to support others students. It describes group organisation, initiation processes and outlines help strategies used, namely periodic monitoring, responding to questions and immediate intervention. The intervention described in this study advocated a prescriptive approach to pair / peer interaction as a tactical response to the often intensive demands on teacher time when classes are engaged in coding tasks.

Creative Computing -------------------

In this context Creative Computing is a broad term for the exploration of tools and practices around making diverse artefacts with multimedia software allowing programming and easy to use electronics. The term is used by a school of researches and designers clustered around the MIT Media Lab and their work stemming from pioneering work on the LOGO programming language by Seymour Papert 1980). One of their most visible and researched tool is currently Scratch. Scratch is free desktop and web software used to support coding of games and other media projects. It uses coloured code blocks rather than a text based approach, allows incorporation of a wide variety of media and has an online community for sharing created works. It is productive to look at some of the research and researchers that make up the Scratch community as a way of exploring some of the different threads of research around collaboration using this tool.

As previously mentioned, Resnick explores Scratch as a tool allowing the the sharing of user created artefacts . A Scratch creation is open by default and allows other users to click on a See Inside button to view the code blocks used to construct it. While other researchers have conducted studies on the collaborative processes of the online Scratch community, which we will return to later, Resnick is more focused on the collaborative potential offered by the Scratch toolset. Specifically, in terms of collaboration, he highlights the ability to remix programmable media to form production teams, and give each other feedback 2007).

Many of Resnick's papers focus on design considerations or technical considerations to lower the barriers to engage in programming Resnick et al., 2005, 2009; Resnick and Silverman, 2005a), while others when focusing on the user experience use individual anecdotes of actual use Brennan et al., 2010; Resnick, 2012).

More extensive and complimentary studies focusing on user collaboration in the online Scratch community have been carried out by Resnick's colleagues Fields et al., 2014, 2013; Hill and Monroy-Hernandez, 2013; Roque et al., 2012).

A study by Roque and colleagues shows pro-active members of the community engaging in remixing and competitions 2012). The authors describe the range of sophisticated technical and social processes that new users need to juggle in order to be an active member of collaborative Scratch projects or competitions. However, examination of log files on the platform server show that only a small minority of users are involved in such collaborative processes Fields et al., 2014).

While some of the work of Roque and colleagues explores strategies and designs to to support the development of the complex behaviours of proficient Scratch collaboration within the online community 2016b), others bring in more facilitated processes in family or after school settings .

I want to look in detail at one specific intervention which is particularly relevant to my areas of study, the Family Creative Learning programme Roque et al., 2016a).

There is a change of focus here from technical design of tools to the techniques used by adults in informal intergenerational learning environments. Roque explores how the use of physical computing tools, and non digital activities support the development of collaborative coding processes. Including the tactics of

• Make the project personal, to increase motivation and identification with project

• Build language to support collaboration in coding process, ie making coding processes concrete

• Build collaborative capacities of learners before non familiar digital task

Drawing on the work of Barron 2009) which identified diverse roles parents played in relation to creative computing activity in informal settings. Roque examines the experience of young people, parents and facilitators. Specifically this are, in relation to their children, collaborating with children, learning from children, brokering other learning opportunities, providing non-technical support and access to technical resources. In FCL Roque identifies parental roles as temporary, with participants moving from one to another over the course of sessions.

Future study by Roque and Jain identified areas of interest including the use of guidance rather than direction from adults, drawing out user interests to bring into project work, and the identification of different roles adults play in this process. The study then turns to look at the process of development of these roles in adults. There are interesting case studies of students who volunteered to be facilitators Roque and Jain, n.d.).

Maria noted the importance of modeling a tinkerers mindset to families, Sam the balance between over and under facilitation, Alex felt proud at making good judgement calls about being a positive and constructive additions to a particular families 'learning dynamic n.d., p. 6)'

The observations above are supported by Crowley and Brahms, 2016) from the who note the connections with people that participants build as they engage with making. This aspect is explored in the next section on making.

The Maker Movement Tinkering Methods ------------------------------------

In terms of what tinkering adds to inquiry-based, project approaches, a review posits that in particular access to materials with certain affordances but an open scope, lowers barriers to entry for participants Vossoughi and Bevan, 2015).

We can see that limiting choices have been made in the design of the toolset, be it physical kit or a software product. Resnick and colleagues have explored the principles of successful tinkering and construction kits 2013; Resnick and Silverman, 2005b). They explore many tensions surrounding use of equipment and software which is easy to get started but which allows the designer to see the process and not be too limiting technically, which provides immediate feedback but can involve a wide range of materials or genres.

DO A quick outline of STEM tinkering, terms, and context of museams, and potential in schools. The nature of the process lends itself to informal environments and by have a focus on my target audience of family learning.

While, some proponents of tinkering focus on the possibilities offered by the toolsets Resnick et al., 2005; Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013; Resnick and Silverman, 2005b; Rusk et al., 2008) , there is also a rich seam of research which has analysed and provided frameworks to help social aspects of STEM tinkering Bevan et al., 2015).

The framework was developed through extensive analysis of OVERVIEW of methods?\ and it was described in other writing / OVERVIEW??

The context of the study is significant here, the nature of museums as spaces with rapid turn over necessitates a choice of toolsets which is quick to pick up and requires immediate feedback. Here design begins with immediate prototypes before any considered of analysis of the product needs. A design process which requires a more in-depth planning stage before engaging with hands on making would not lend itself to the definition of tinkering imagined here.

**T**he potential for empowerment via "Digital Making" is explored in a report by Sefton-Green for nominet (2013). Sefton-Green explores tensions between informal sites and cultures of digital making and attempts to bring this potential into formal sites. This exposes another tension in terms of the suitability of online spaces to share and create work. FIND AND EXPLORE

In the next section, we can compare this "jump right in" approach with a more thoughtful collaborative process to decide the remit of the product being designed as seen in participatory design.

Critical Making in Reflective Spaces, Critical Participatory Design -------------------------------------------------------------------

The field of Design Thinking and Participatory Design has yielded interesting results particularly in the area of informal science exploration and the co-creation of children's technologies Yip et al., 2013).

The process of designing for other people draws on the promise offered by design thinking movement to create new objects, services or digital products.

The design process has many strands but common themes include the importance attached to the following stages, ideation techniques stages building on user inspirations, iterative approaches involving the use of physical or testable prototypes, using of user testing to inform improvements to build empathy with the user's perspectives and experiences.

While many participatory design methods are aimed at commercial products or public services and may not be suitable immediately for educational use, others highlight the value of empathy as a factor to facilitate better learning outcomes is also highlighted by Nash in Lor, 2017) - MORE DETAIL

For examples, the importance of empathy and other communicative competencies are particularly promising for application in the field of informal family education according to Uchidiuno and colleagues Uchidiuno et al., 2017). For these researchers, design approaches takes on particular challenges and opportunities when viewed in a family context, including: the tendency for more informed participants to take a lead on collaborative processes, the need for young people to be build skills in both subject knowledge and design competency concurrently, Yip et al., 2013).

MORE DETAIL ON PROCESS NEEDED\ The results found value on the ideation stages, focus on empathy, and the iterative process. For example iteration helped to build knowledge of family learning roles and increase the bi-directional nature of helping relationships.

The next section is a deeper analysis of the potential of making to embrace political and ethical explorations.

In Ratto's description Critical Making he values critical thinking as a possible outcome of the process of the social making objects. Thus widening the potential of 'objects to think with' beyond science and maths to encompass more civic concerns.

Ratto, 2011) highlights a gulf between technical work and social work that critical making can bridge. More specifically, in the exploration of societal issues effected by technology.

In Ratto's description Critical Making he values critical thinking as a possible outcome of the process of the social making objects. Thus widening the potential of 'objects to think with' beyond science and maths to encompass more civic concerns. He finds use in a distinction between *caring about* an issue and a more informed *caring for* an issue informed by experience and a sense of responsibility. This stems from the reframing of our reality as designed rather than discovered. Thus shifting matters of fact (which can't be changed) into matters of concern where the outcome is at play Latour, 2008).

In the exploration of two case studies the author recommends acknowledging and exploring the reductive nature of process of translating complex social issues into physical and digital models as a way of mitigating risks of over simplification discussions Ratto, 2011, p. 8).   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why specifically PD not design and iteration -- as per Resnick's creative spiral Resnick, 2007)? The work of Resnick can be compared as lacking a focus on context of design. We can compare this to a more context sensitive approach of PD which has a stage on gathering user needs, output requirements or an exploration of project goals and values Flanagan et al., 2005; Scaife and Rogers, n.d.).

Discussion ----------

GENDER EQUALITY MORE THAN JUST PARTICIPATION

There is a push for gender equality in access to computer science, part of this is driven by social factors, this is explore by Fields and colleagues in the Scratch community, They find results that suggest that even where there is equality of participation, it may not lead to more advanced computer science use, so there may need to be engender deeper participation Fields et al., 2014).

CRITIQUE of TECH FOCUS of MAKING

FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL, IMMEDIATE CREATIVITY HERE COMPARED TO A MORE GROUP APPROACH? HOW DOES ROQUES WORK FIT INTO THIS? SEE LATER CRITIQUE OF CUBAN ON COMPUTERS,

While there is compelling evidence for the appeal of tools for tinkering, we can argue that the selection of the materials, while still providing creative opportunities, guides participants towards certain outcomes. This argument is particularly strong in the case of "Making Kits" which have become a output of the broader maker movement. These kits can be bought as off the shelf products which have an aesthetic of backyard inventor, but which are predilected in terms of the possible outcomes, essentially providing a return to following instructions to create a predetermined product.

The decontextualised focus on personal creativity and exploration of some programmes is more closely aligned with hobby based participatory culture.

Critique of Maker Movement as a product driven, out of a box approach as 'fatally flawed" over emphais on tools rather than processes, drawing on Cuban's 2003) critique of introduction of other technology into schools Martin, 2015, p. 37).\ NOTE: there is exploration of this in the conclusion.

A similar decontextualisation of the underlying goals surrounding making and tinkering is identified in a review of literature on tinkering by Bevan and Vossoughi as misleading 2015, p. 40). While concepts of "innovation" and "global competiveness" which drive some STEM programmes can be seen as uncontroversial aids to economic development, different motives for STEM programmes are identified, some driven by an empowerment agenda, others semi-militarised Vossoughi and Vakil, 2018).

EXPLORE METHODS OF STUDIES -- TOWARDS ACTIVITY THEORY

**From Teasley and Kafai, **The lack of specific research around the detail of collaboration processes in game making identified in the introduction to this writing points to the need for more research in the areas of how learner maintain Joint Problem Spaces, and sustain each others motivation specifically in this field.

The work of Resnick focuses on the stories of participants and the diversity of the artefacts that they can and do make. The focus on accessible toolkits and a creative spiral process suggests frictionless and immediate creativity.

Ratto by contrast explores the critical process and the importance of building shared understanding of context, the ease of making and the focus on created artefacts is deprioritised. In fact the benef

Ratto maps three, non-linear phases of Critical Making, exploration of existing areas (texts or ideas), making prototypes to reductively map such ideas and finally reflection and exploration of ideas through the revision of prototypes. The author links the process to three key elements of constructionism the possibility for emotional dimension of learning, the importance of transitional objects

We can make a parallel between the conversations stages of critical making to the forms of discourse needed computer mediated learning Teasley, using the computer as a way of disambiguating language with reference to something more concrete on the screen.

Indeed there are wide parallels here between the different approaches covered in terms of the use of mediating language and tools to explore and construct meaning. Exploring the difference or the specifics of methodologies to explore underlying perspectives at this point can be helpful to inform the particular focus of my study.

What differences can be seen in the **methodologies used.** The methodologies vary from an analysis of the works created, productive output of online individuals collaborations, to case studies from workshop notes, to self reporting, detailed debriefs. (Include examples here.)

The granularity and immediacy of the methodologies used is of interest for this study. I worry also about the validity of the group debriefs in terms of the incentive for the participants to say things that are pleasing to the researchers. The value expressed by the adult participants in Roque's thesis study, saying that they came back because they felt that the facilitators values their presence is a testament to this.

By it's nature, the process of flow in creation and collaboration is something very of the moment. Very few of these studies give details about how collaboration in the moment is captured.

Video analysis and play back to participants therefore holds a lot of interest for me, to capture key moments of collaborative problems solving, inspiration, generative ideation and then to play them back to participants to gather more detail of what led them to that point could be yield very promising results.

What could best be investigated by this in the moment observation? Perhaps the trigger points for break through or new ideas. The use of language that had been built in previous activities is rich material.

The recording of the screen, and vocal interaction in relation to what is happening on the screen while coding games or making digital assets allows for a triangulation of physical actions, resultant screen and conversational reactions which may be illuminating in a way that simple transcripts or video camera capture would not.

What are the effects of collaboration on a text code document from more than one screen using the collaboration possibilities of concurrent document editing? Do these mitigate pair programming issues?

**Methods of interest for my study**

Evaluation of the different kinds of collaboration in the context of family learning. From the point of view of the practicality of methods to assess. The co-operation in projects, and the asynchronous work on collaboratively produced are less immediately useful in feeding back to the families than the immediate, in the moment creativity of maintaining a Joint Problems Space. There also appears to be less research into this area.

While the technologies used could facilitate an interesting study of asynchronous contributions to a text-code game over time, the target audience of families does not suit this kind of analysis. They are likely to be working in the same physical space. Also while online intra-family collaboration outside of the taught sessions would also be of interest, such approaches would require a high level of learner autonomy, which is not predicted or required for participation in the proposed programme.

ON COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION -- AND MESSY JOINS

PBL values authenticity of tasks and a framework to facilitate cooperative work, allocation by role often predisposes group work to a cooperative model rather than cocreation following Teasley.

How to square the potential of online collaborative communities with Teasleys' analysis of Cooperation vs collaboration which prioritises the value of real time collaboration. While the distinction between cooperation and collaboration is potentially useful in complexifying concepts, it should be noted that the process of working separately still requires collaboration at the point of integration, and is particularly valuable and trickly to manage compared to real-life, real-time collaboration.

ISSUE OF SCALE AND REPLICABILITY -- TOOL / SYSTEM DESIGN VS INTERVENTION

Resnick has more of a focus on designing the toolset so that it facilitates the creative process and encourages a frictionless journey around a design thinking inspired iterative spiral. Taps into a STEM pipeline funding?

Gee in the "affinity space" term also focuses on the affordances of a process which he separates from notions of communities, particularly communities of practice.

Roque makes a case for the unpicking of the supportive and collaborative roles that parents can play and for facilitators to bring these out in debriefs as an aid to build this capacity and awareness of family learning roles.

To return to the FCL design, while it was effective in terms of accessibility through the use of materials and non-digital activities to build confidence especially of parents more used to that process, we can see that it left researchers with questions about the effectiveness of the process to enable learning at home. Then non-replicability of the process can be compared the infinitely replicable informal process of hanging out line in the frame of Ito's online and social participation in informal communities.

This tension of focus and scaffolding vs the freedom and fuzzy nature of participatory culture is a hard one to square in family learning interventions.

In looking at the family context of tinkering in museams and comparing it to the more indepth approach of PD or critical making, is there something about the family context which lends itself to a more superficial approach, either in terms of time commitment, or a wish to avoid more sticky conversations about needs, values, prioritisation etc.

There is a tension between the advantages of open ended projects, and the crtiques of this approach which highlight that without support that collaboration is diffcult between learners and needs to be scaffolded with more structured activities, see for example, Kirschner et al., 2006; Kollar et al., 2006)

COMPLEXITY OF PARENT -- CHILD ROLES IN EXPLORING TECH

A common rhetoric is of the internet and games as an online digital playground open to all to dive in and create. Prensky positions the parent as ignorant or even an obstacle to this process as indicated in the tite of one popular book "Don't bother me Mom, I'm learning". Such a simplistic view of a Digital Divide between parents and children is complexified by studies addressing the collaborative relationships in more detail.

While Correa 2015), explores the role of children as brokers of technology in family environments especially in low socio-economic families where parents access to technology is limited, other learning from Roque and Barron show a diversity and complexity of parent-child roles in a creative learning environment where tools which are new to both parties.

OVERCOMING THE BARRIERS TO COLLABORATION IN DIGITAL PROJECTS

As generative activity is exposed the exception rather than norm, and even in generative communities, actually productive partnerships in communities like Scratch are extremely rare compared to false starts. Studies of the New Grounds site which has a similar aim of creating media collaborations, via collabs, showed a 80 percent failure rate of collaborative projects Luther et al., 2010).

As such while the potential to explore an online element of sharing of work created is worth investigating, there is to some degree an element of faith in the power of such a community to galvanise social learning.

The extent to which the model of the self taught computer geek which is celebrated in studies on linux Sefton-Green, 2013, p. 41).

Removed sections ================

The creation of digital artefacts, in this case games, in collaborative family units can be seen as an example of project based learning. Many forms of PBL, both problem and project approaches, rely on the fostering of a collaborative environment. This involves shifts in behaviour and roles students take on more generative, reflective and evaluative tasks and teachers take on a more facilitative role Ertmer and Glazewski, 2015). Both parties can find these new roles challenging and as such many PBL programmes advocate forms of scaffolding to support the process of group collaboration and student centred approaches Brush and Saye, 2002). While many of these approaches are non specifically designed to support collaboration others designed to aid content integration did have this effect. Kolodner and colleagues noted the value of using importance of using spaces and processes to make student learning visible Kolodner et al., 2004, 2003). While some of these examples use digital spaces, others are more low-tech involving white boards, sticky notes and collaboratively created mind-map/ relational diagrams.

On Digital Making: -------------------

The potential for empowerment via "Digital Making" is explored in a report by Sefton-Green for nominet 2013). While the value of digital literacy is promoted by various non profits linked to digital freedoms,

There is a sense that for Mozilla this was an area that was a funded stream but which they had limited success as being the home of Webmaking as services like Thimble and Popcorn which were heavily promoted via the Webmaker programme were withdrawn. Presumably as lack of significant uptake meant they did not get ongoing funding.

Sefton-Green explores tensions between informal sites and cultures of digital making and attempts to bring this potential into formal sites. This exposes another tension in terms of the suitability of online spaces to share and create work.

We can look at the migration of work from Thimble to Glitch.com as one example of a move to a more industry focused Code Playground, compared to a education specific site. We can also compare this to the use by Code Club, (via Raspberry Pi Foundation) of Trinket. All of these tools can be described as Code Playgrounds, a website where users create, share and remix each others creations which are constructed using common web technologies of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

While there is a danger of focusing too much on the toolset and neglecting the process involved, the tools and the community surrounding them do have potential to be part of the learning experience.

Participatory Culture and Making around the Game ------------------------------------------------

David gauntlet and DIY making, making as a way to pause for thought before answering or discussing, particularly of interest in terms of methods here Gauntlett, 2007). Areas for accessibility here too.

Gauntlett celebrates a rich history of making as an empowering activity, drawing on the ethos of William Morris and broadening the scope of to include as "everyday creativity" that encompasses self made internet creations which are shared on internet sites such as YouTube, Flickr and other sharing platforms often refered to as Web 2.0 platforms.

Studies on game playing explore the value of linked creative activities that promote creative reflection through the creation and sharing of artefacts. (link to mulitliteracies)

In the context of computer games this is particularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements which may including online play or internet forums which contain conversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis, live chat possibilities and so on.

There have been attempts to design learning environments which support the acquisition of these related skills through engagement with addiscratchtional activities around the game (have there? where?). Gee refers to this as metagaming, (where?)

Pioneering studies on metagaming activities (Torbin & Turkle) see Francis, 2006). Torbin, son managing a game site,

Diy media production and other meaning making in game playing communities are included in what been termed participatory culture Jenkins, 2009).

It may be worth exploring the difference between the terms Jenkins, 2018). As Gee makes a distinction between the value of connections and participation in of themselves in PC, and a more designed, structured "space" that has its own affordences of affinity spaces. This is relevant in a background of more right wing participatory culture which differs from earlier left wing prevalence of early PC years.

We can draw on Jenkin's exploration of the subject to explain why although these world of participatory culture is often driven by the interests of young people, a lassez faire approach is not viable for three reasons, the participation gap, transparency issues due to lack of reflective skills and issues surrounding ethical fluency and literacies 2009, p. 15).

Itō and colleagues used ethography methods to study informal digital explorations and identify play, and researches the resulting learning outcomes Itō, 2009; Itō et al., 2010). Their studies expose a differentiation between, hanging out, messing around and geeking out. Young people are primarily spending time online socially, whereas the remixing or other immediate forms of generative work are less common, and geeking out representing a more specialised production activity helped by a particular community of practice.

A key finding here is inequality of access. But What is Ito's conclusions?

The importance of that sharing has been highlighted in face of platforms that only allow creation as opposed to sharing and interaction around creation Grimes and Fields, 2015).

REWORDED SECTOINS

(Ching and Kafai, 2008). undertook a study on peer interactions in environmental simulation creation in Logo. The authors identify limits of studies on collaboration and teacher support in project based approaches,

Limits that they identify are, short projects and a more perscriptive approach than is normal in more open ended process.

They advocates facilitation of a wider approach to peer interaction as a tactical response. They develop a model to allow a richer description of helping activities, particularly those of collaborative socialisation and peer guidance.

MORE DETAIL ON METHODS AND FRAMEWORK?

Methods but the following framework was created based on video and audio recording of iterations between forth graders tasked with creating simulations and fifth graders tasked to support others students.

The framework, has three levels and describes how groups are organised, initiation processes and the kinds of help strategy used which include periodic monitoring, responding to questions and immediate intervention. (projecting your self into objects to think with) and the value of 'messing about' to avoid constrictive working processes Papert, 1988).

NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THESE MEANS

RESEARCH METHODS ON ASSESSING 21ST C SKILLS ARE LACKING

In their exploration of studies game making to enhance creativity Kangas, 2010; Robertson and Nicholson, 2007; Yee Leng et al., 2010, 2010), Earp and team find that the few studies carried out show potential for creative thinking when student are given access to co-production processes and other tools to support creative thinking. The authors conclude that research methods to assess 21^st^ Century skills are lacking despite the very nature of roles involved of programming, artists and designer making game making inherently collaborative.

PARTICIPATORY DESIGN BEYOND EMPATHY WITH END USERS

There is a school of PD intervention designers who see a process as a way to go beyond using empathy with the end user design of a better product. Instead their focus is to use this shift in perspective and focus on context and dynamics to build the critical thinking capacities of participants. Ratto, the ethical elements and process to uncover this.
