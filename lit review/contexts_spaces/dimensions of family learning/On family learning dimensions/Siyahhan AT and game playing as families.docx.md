Intro pro games as family learning op

Then looking a developing a game space that allows home culture to be explored and critical facilities of adults looked at.

The few studies completed on parent-child interaction around video games reported video games promoting positive interactions between parents and children (Aarsand, 2007; Mitchell, 1985), and in particular, between fathers and sons (Ito et al., 2010).

The questions here seem similar to mine

What is the nature of intergenerational play, the collaborative work that occurs whenparent and child are immersed within a shared game space?\ 2. What are the challenges and opportunities of bringing parents and children together around an educational video game like QA?

In my study the first question could be identical.

The second, what are the challenges of providing learner choice in a t txt based game making design?

The Rticle has good pacing in the way it describes activity theory and presents the project using the terminology in the AT frame work .

I should do the same for the making of games. As a blog post .

Do it based on my observations from this round of testing.

These guys redesigned computer mission to encourage more intergenerational play. I could do the same for the side missions.

Expanding Vygotsky's (1978) sociocultural theory of learning, Newman et al. (1989) discussed the construction zone, referring to the shared psychological space where two minds meet---for example, that of a parent and a child---during problem-solving activities

Using AT

The authors talk of community norms freely in their analysis of the parent child days interaction

For example expressing as a norm parent expert, child novice relationships and highlighting divergent behaviour

And comparing a majority of parents following a programme community norm of success as collaboration, and a divergent norm of success against another dyad.

I\'m not sure how valid this is for my experiments without looking more deeply into the relationships and the norms of my home educator groups.

That very context may take quite a bit of unteasing, and one probably beyond the remit of this study.

So how community norms for informal groups are established or measured is a key issue here

In truth that expectation of a norm is a starting ground for detailed deiscussion on this very point, the dyad of brayden and patent as two years Xpert gamers , and the conflict of sharing an avatar that results is notable and could form the basis for a comparison with my process.

So it may be worth getting some community norms off the shelf from Barron or similar to describe dyad interactions. Then also getting participants to complete a short likerat scale questionnaire to get more background info on that, and potentially attitudes to games. And the battle test too.

**Programme cultural norms vs rules vs object**

In the article the cultural norms and rules and even obj ct seem to overlap. So a clarification via description and diagram would seem to be in order.

**Object**, progress in coding practice and sound art design to be able to own a game by transforming it to the greatest extent possible from the starting point.

**Tools**. Keyboard and mouse, screen, location based vocabulary, ui for piskel, ui for glitch, support resources printed, online resources, specific helping tactics, physical map for progression, physical avatar,

**Rules**. Must start from shared base, must share code with others, can work separately but must check in with family members periodically, mustn\'t skip out on games unless there\'s a reason. Try to help anyone who needs it and ask everyone for help if you need it. Try to get help from either the help resources or the people around you as well as the facilitator.

Must try at least one challenge card every session.

**Community**. Norms of facilitator, expert , novice, in learning relationship

Gaming knowledge and norms adopted from that culture,

**Division of labour**.

Who has keyboard and mouse,

Different If working together or separately.
