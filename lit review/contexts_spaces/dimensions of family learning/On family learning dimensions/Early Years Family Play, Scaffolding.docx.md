**Early Years Family Play, Scaffolding - Needham, Rogoff, etc**

From Needham and Jackson - Chapter 7 engaging with parents in earlyyears settings.

The key terminology here is "dual focus" groups, which makes adistinction between home family settings and classroom settings, sosimilar to the third space metaphor.

Worth looking into to be more clear about this.

**Key areas of study**

**Scaffolding, co-construction and sustained Shared thinking,** areidentified as generally accepted pedagogies to benefit independence.

Chapter is broken down as such.

**Children take control**

Building automony in problem solving

**Promoting Child Led Interaction**

More nuanced definitions of scaffolding, for some, support ot get intothe learning zone,

Jordan says scaffolding is active adult support.

And it's different from co-construction, as co construction is more openin terms of the end goal, scaffolding more directly led by a presetadult goal.

**Shared thinking**

From rogoff (1998) - develops early, can be non verbal, and exploresintersubjectivity

**Developing Sustained Shared Thinking**

From Siraj-Blatchford - 2 or more workign together to solve problems,invoving clarifying and evaluating and during the process extenddefinitions or narratives.
