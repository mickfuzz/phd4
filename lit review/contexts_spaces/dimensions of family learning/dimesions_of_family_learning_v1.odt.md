Overview of Family Learning ============================

########## Background and Introduction 

The focus of this study is on collaborative production in familylearning environments. I plan to approach it from constructivist,sociocultural perspectives. I am keen to involved, playful use of gamesand accessible construction materials to aid the creative process,lowering barriers to participation and help build confidence develop theidentities of participant as makers and creators. The interactionbetween physical and digital aspects of the making processes is of greatinterest to me.

Quick starting Notes from past writing--------------------------------------

Sefton-Green's concern about exceptionalist case studies in digitalmaking, and thus scalability of making processes, is underscored byin-depth studies on informal, digital communitiesItōet al., 2010). Ito and colleagues note that generative activities(compared to more social interactions) are the exception rather thannorm even in expressly creative communities.

Introductory Thoughts---------------------

This is a brief look at three key dimensions for family learningrelevant to my study. It intentionally skirts wider areas of familylearning, including life skills and parenting programmes, that whilerelevant, are less directly linked to the focus of what I'm looking at.

In short I'll look at; the study of the role of games, play and inparticular video games in a family context, broad approaches to familyliteracy, families and STEM learning, in particular the area of familiesundertaking STEM projects together.

To move beyond an exploration of context and case studies, I willunderpin this exploration in the light of a socio-cultural approach.Thus the mechanisms for social exchange and shared construction ofemergent understandings will be highlighted. This is particularlyrelelvant to the area of family learning, as explained by Rogoff

Reviews of Family Learning Context----------------------------------

Overview of dimensions of import and definitions.

1\) programmes concentrating on Family Literacy, Language and Numeracy(FLLN); and 2) those utilising a wider curriculum and focusing on WiderFamily Learning(WFL)."Family\_learning\_research\_review\_final-8\_June\_2012.pdf,"n.d.)

Identified from streams of funding available in the UK

Potential outcomes and dimensions of family learning covered by LambLamb,2009) ,

and include progression, self-confidence and self-esteem motivation andself-efficacy aspirations and ambitions parenting practices, skills,also referred to as human capital, social capital,cultural capital

A review of family learning by future lab also explored the followingissuesGrant,2009);

-   childrens lives increasingly scholarised, parents can regulate this.

Family Literacies Learning in Third Space-----------------------------------------

Family literacy background and definitionsBrookset al., n.d.). Starts quite narrow in focus to build child literacy,later widened in focus to include creative activities, music, anddigital literacies.

Including the ORIM framework, opportunities, recognition, interaction,modeling.

Developmental work which follows the study of this space widens thescope considerably. Pahl et al in case studiesPahland Kelly, 2005).

-   the concept of home culture as funds to leverage in literacy work    Moll    et al., 1992).-   The wider role of diverse texts as a vehicle for family expression    and literacies is explored in Pahl and Kelly's case study.-   The transition between home and school via cultural life is of value-   need to evolve beyond situated literacy, to more creative /    discursive learning happening in these new third space    Moje    et al., 2004). Define third space here

    Such a third space which is a fusion of the literacies is held to be    one which is better suited to explore evolving definitions of more    equitable to minority group learners    Gutiérrez    et al., 2011). The exploration and hybrid approach to literacies    here is in line with the sociohistorical importance of culture and    an expansive view of learning    Engeström,    2001, 1999).

Rogoff and Socio-cultural approaches - ( In this writing use as ajumping off point -- or as a review at end)

Needham Fleer and colleagues explore Cultural Historical approaches andRogoff -- context of play

Wider statements about learning through participation? From rogoff

Play and Games in a Family Context----------------------------------

2 sentences on a very general definitions, play as voluntary, as playfulin nature, game more structured. This will be explore elsewhere in mywriting.

Overall on importance of play in a sociocultural context,

-   consequence free rehearsal for participation in society-   role based approach similar to CoP-   make point of shift in more abstract / commercial nature of play    compared to a more directly visible and community oriented nauture    of play in previous societies and why this is important (needham)    p35 from    Rogoff,    2003))

Most commonly researched in early years setting. Explored in needham ina dual focus environment and international focus by Fleer and PS

Some of the key issues include;

-   disparity in approaches / expectations of families and practitioners    (from Needham),    Needham,    n.d.)-   international variations in how involved in play parents should be    Pramling    Samuelsson and Fleer, 2009)

Digital Play and Making in a Family Context-------------------------------------------

Bring into strands perhaps, use of media, playing games, making gamesand media-\Also perhaps in family environments and in third spaces.

The wider concepts and context of digital and media and learning (DML)bear investigation, as it's diverse but grouped in part by work ofMacArthur Foundation. Contextual factors for third space traininginclude;

-   background in community / radical politics training    Blum-Ross    and Livingstone, 2016) - however the authors note a move to more    individual storytelling, then creativity, then tech focus of DML,    then subsumed by a computing curriculum focus more in line with hard    skills focus of the government (mi-   Wider work on the role of parents in digital environments for kids    are in depth and instructive. There are class distinctions about who    makes digital content    Livingstone    et al., 2018)-   This and other studies show parental roles mainly as regulating    screen time and other access issues rather than creative co-use    Hollingworth    et al., 2009).-   Hollingworth' s study also shows parental anxiety as a barrier and    explores the role of children as the technology experts in some    households

"Media and mediation between generations", children acting as the brokerof technology in households, upsetting cultural norms of parent asexpert.Itō,2009, p. 39). Ito and parental involvement in video game play seen aspositive for communication bringing families closer togetherItōet al., 2010).

These positive aspects are presented in contrast to narratives ofconflicts between generations around new media use.

Ito advances the concept of messing around, and geeking out as aprogression of technical proficiency and creative production.

While not exclusive to a family setting, Ito sees family environment asone of the more suitable spaces for this kinds of more exploratorymessing around to happen, along with friendships groups, interest drivengroups or youth oriented informal programmes, the requiredcharacteristics being the lack of a concrete end goal required by moreformal learning programmesItō,2009, p. 44).

Picking up from previous section, we can see as desireable thepossibility of a READ / Write approach to games and gaming culture toallow for cultural exploration. Gee explores this in affinities ofculture and Jenkins in Participatory Culture. Ito also

It is worth exploring the difference between solo, or freeformexploration of these spaces, and a more scaffolded approach.

In facilitated spaces

The value of face-to-face facilitation of family interactions hasexplored from multiple perspectives using a variety of methods, forexample in the work of Roque and Bevan and colleaguesBevanet al., 2015; Roque, 2016).

Intergenerational Game Making

Some work has been done in this areaOuelletet al., 2017).

Exploration of Family Themes----------------------------

Not really a family theme, but explore the link between theindividualisation of the context of community media, and out of schoolsettings provided by extra funding (explored in Livingstone piece wherecommunity media based around social action) and the overallde-contextualisation of learning in schools which is often decried.

Or set this up at the start as a problem, say family learning offers andalternative and return to it at the end and say it's not so simple,families are often the driver towards job / skills based approaches toinformal learning. But it doesnt have to be that way.
