Overview of Family Learning ============================

########## Background and Introduction 

The focus of this study is on collaborative production in familylearning environments. I plan to approach it from constructivist,sociocultural perspectives.

Introductory Thoughts---------------------

The term Family Learning is complex in that it can encompass alllearning happening in a home learning environment or on visits outsidethe home with family members or may refer to more formal provision. Thisattempts to explore various contexts all on a spectrum of more formalprovision in state provided spaces and more informal dimensions oflearning happening in the family home. To do this I will examine studiesdealing with family involvement in early years play-based provision,family literacy programmes and finally more informal learning happeningin the digital technologies in the home.

In future writing, to move beyond an exploration of context and casestudies, I will underpin this exploration in the light of asocio-cultural approach. In this way the mechanisms for social exchangeand shared construction of emergent understandings will be highlighted.

Context of Family Learning Provision------------------------------------

In UK Family Learning (FL) and and the home learning environment (HLE)have received more attention since research indication the preschool HLEto be one of the most significant factors on later educationalattainment and developmental progressMelhuishet al., 2008; Siraj‐Blatchford et al., 2008).

This section covers funded Family Learning programmes in the UK. Familyin this context is normally taken to mean one or more family members ofwhich one is a child and other fulfilling a parental role, which couldbe a parent, grandparent, relative or siblingLamb,2009). Recent reviews adopt a similarly broad definition of FL toencompass streams of activities streams of activity are identified asFamily Literacy, Language and Numeracy (FLLN) and Wider Family Learning(WFL), the former focusing on the relevant key skills and the latterfollowing a broader curriculum including creative activities, music, anddigital literaciesBrookset al., 2008; Carpentieri, 2012; Grant, 2009; Lamb, 2009; *Review offamily learning*, 2016). Lamb2009)notes that this categorisation may be seen as more administrative thanpedagogical in nature, citing two relevant funding streams available inthe UK from the Learning Skills Council. Potential outcomes anddimensions of family learning include "progression, self-confidence andself-esteem motivation and self-efficacy aspirations and ambitionsparenting practices, human capital, social and cultural capital"Lamb,2009).

While the value of a positive home environment is well establishedSiraj‐Blatchfordet al., 2008), research on the impact of FL programmes is limitedBrookset al., 2008; Lamb, 2009; Swain et al., 2014. While evaluation is mostlyfocused on the literacy outcomes of children related to FLLN programmes,broader benefits have been identified. These include parents reportingmore confidence in how to support their children's learning, increasedtime spent in home activities with children, improved literacy andconfidence surrounding literacy for parents, and greater contact withschoolsSwainet al., 2014).

Play in a Family Learning Context---------------------------------

A key line of research concerning the importance of the home learningenvironment (HLE) is the longitudinal study EPPE (Effective Provision ofPre-school Education). This study gathered data of pre-schoolenvironment of young people and found that the a stimulating HLE to bethe most significant factor in determining progression in cognitive,social and behavioural skillsEvangelouet al., 2005; Feinstein et al., 2004). In this section family play isconsidered in the context of how state provision aims to support it andas a vehicle for the exploration of interrelated the helping strategiesof scaffolding and sustained shared thinking.

Needham identifies parent toddler groups, or "stay and play sessions" inthe UK as an under-researched areaNeedham,2011, p. 91). He charts a short history of disparate playing togethersessions with little governmental support before 1997 and a growth ofsupported sessions under New-Labour which develop into increasinglysophisticated pedagogical interventions which encouraged parents toengage and support with their child's play processesAnninget al., 2005).

An exploration of the terminology of play and games will be exploredelsewhere in my writing but for the purposes of this section it isimportant to note a key distinction between two key categories of play,namely between epistemic play and ludic playHutt,1979; Marsh et al., 2016). Epistemic play comprises personalexplorations to gain knowledge of surrounding objects and environmentswhereas ludic play draws on fantasy and symbolic play with a greaterfocus on interaction between individuals.

This distinction is important as it reflects a broader shift in theapproach of early years literature away from personal cognitivedevelopment towards a sociocultural approach to education. Needhamcontends has this shift yet to be fully realised in the context ofpolicy and practice in early years provisionNeedham,2011). While the EYFS framework explicitly acknowledges the importanceof key social learning practicesSylvaet al., 2004), there are still a greater focus on individual explorationand learning designs within the EYFS literature. This focus can beattributed to the legacy of the influence on previous educationalpolicies of a piagetian focus on cognitive progress through individualexploratory playSiraj-Blatchford,2004). The implication for support of young people in practice is thatadults should take an active role in the facilitation of more social,ludic play forms rather than focusing only on facilitating access tolearning environments and materials that privilege on more individualexploratory play.

To better help parents and professionals support and Needham and Jackson2014)draw our attention to the desirability for detailed definitions ofrelevant strategies. Jordan2004)highlights that the term scaffolding is sometimes employed to describeadult design of learning activities which provide support for a child'sindividual exploration, proposing that a more authentic interpretationis one where there is more active support and direction by adultsWoodet al., 1976). Jordan advances a term co-creation to describe activitieswhich are characterised by high level of interaction between adult andchild where activity goals have strong input from children rather thanbeing prescribed by adults.

The term "sustained shared thinking" (SST), which becomes prominentthrough the work of the previously mentioned EPPE project, has beenadopted in policy is used with the guidance documents within the EYFS.SST is broad in scope and is described as

An episode in which two or more individuals 'work together' in anintellectual way to solve a problem, clarify a concept, evaluateactivities, extend a narrative etc. Both parties must contribute to thethinking and it must develop and extend theunderstanding.IramSiraj-Blatchford et al., 2002)

Purdon confirms the widespread use of the term SST but notes lack ofclarity of understanding of practitioners2016).Her exploration of the term notes a strong link to Jordan's conceptionof co-creation in that the effective SST is seen to be guided by thechild's interests which the adult explores and extends areas of sharedunderstanding.

The concepts explored above imply the need for practitioners toappreciate the value of development of intersubjectivity through theconstruction of shared understandings in the zone of proximaldevelopment. Understandings of these concepts and how professionals putthem into practice also impact on family learning in that theexpectations of professionals of how adults can support children'slearning may influence those of parents they come into contact with andmay even cause tensions in settings where parents and professional areboth presentNeedham,2011). As an example practitioners who have a more traditionalunderstanding of scaffolding as a designed support may disapprove ofparents who take on a more directive approach to interactions in playsettingsWhalley,2007). To facilitate SST in play adults are guided to draw on theinterests, culture and understandings of children and then extend themby sharing their own experiences and observationEvangelouet al., 2008; Pramling-Samuelsson and Fleer, 2009; Purdon, 2016). Thisis explored in more detail in the next section.

Family Literacy---------------

Broadening conceptions of literacy and the value of context

As previously described a large part of funded family learning in the UKis in the area of numeracy and literacy. There has been a relativerecent broadening of the research on literacy to include non-schoolenvironments and wider conceptions of literacy to includenon-traditional texts, which may be graffiti, internet chat or computergamesGee,2004a; Hull and Schultz, 2001). One relevant line of research exploresthe possibilities for educators to draw on the literacy practices andresources constructed in non-school settings in more traditionalsettingsMollet al., 1992). Here home culture and competencies related to householdfunctioning or wellbeing are described as 'funds of knowledge'Mollet al., 1992, p. 133). The authors describe how such funds can beleveraged in literacy work in school and after school settings.

Developmental work by Pahl and Kelly2005)explore multimodal texts as a vehicle for family expression in casestudies of joint work in family literacy classrooms. While the authorsacknowledge the value of studies of literacy situated in discrete out ofschools locations and practices, they are guided by the work of Leanderand Sheehy, to evolve beyond situated literacy to explore movementsbetween these sitesLeanderand Sheehy, 2004).

In addition the movement of texts between existing home and schoolsettings, Pahl and Kelly's study investigated the potential foremergent, discursive learning happening. To do this they draw on thework of Moje et al.2004)using third space theory. The integration of funds of knowledge from thefirst space of home environment and more academic discourses of thesecond space of school create a new third space. Moje and colleaguesconvincingly describe the value of third space interventions to buildthe skills of young people to navigate diverse texts and discourses frommultiple funds as preparation for academic and professional life.

Third spaces allow more complex explorations learner identities and arethus seen to be more equitable to minority group learnersGutiérrezet al., 2011). The exploration and hybrid approach to literacies here isin line with the sociohistorical importance of culture and an expansiveview of learningEngeström,2001, 1999).

EMERGING SECTION PLEASE IGNORE------------------------------

 Digital Play and Making in a Family Context-------------------------------------------

This section explores studies which look at learning happening in familyenvironments through more naturalistic studies. I will explore contextand then some of the findings of the research which may be of mostrelevance to my study, namely the area of digital and media andlearning.

Family Interactions in the Home

Many studies show parental roles of regulating screen time and otheractivities to negotiate access to digital media are more prevalent thancreative co-useHollingworthet al., 2009). Other studies identify parental anxiety about lack of asa barrier to participation in joint digital activity and conversely therole of children as the technology experts in some householdsCorreaet al., 2015; Roque et al., 2016). Ito explores this as a upsettingcultural norms of 'parent as expert'Itō,2009, p. 39). Intergenerational digital activities are not alwayspresented as problematic, for example parental involvement in video gameplay seen as positive for communication bringing families closertogetherItōet al., 2010).

Ito advances the concept of messing around, and geeking out as aprogression of technical proficiency and creative production. While notexclusive to a family setting, Ito sees family environment as one of themore suitable spaces for this kinds of more exploratory messing aroundto happen, along with friendships groups, interest driven groups oryouth oriented informal programmes, the required characteristics beingthe lack of a concrete end goal required by more formal learningprogrammesItō,2009, p. 44).

Other studies explore material with a focus on intergenerationallearning and playing video games as a broadly participatory andcommunicative practiceCucinelliet al., 2018; Kangas, 2010; Ouellet et al., 2017; Siyahhan and Gee,2018),

The theme of digital media allowing a the emergence of possibility of awhat Lessig terms Read / Write culture2009),is explored in a youth context extensivelyClintonet al., 2006; Gee, 2004b; Gee and Hayes, 2012; Jenkins, 2008, 2006;Peppler and Kafai, 2007). others are even narrower and look at making asin intergenerational activityBrahms,n.d.; Crowley and Brahms, 2016; Ouellet et al., 2017; Romero andOuellet, 2016; Roque et al., 2016; Roque, 2016; Sefton-Green, 2013).

Ito and colleagues note that generative activities (compared to moresocial interactions) are the exception rather than norm even inexpressly creative communities.Itōet al., 2010). Sefton-Green shares this concern about exceptionalistcase studies in digital making, and thus scalability of makingprocesses, is underscored by in-depth studies on informal, digitalcommunities. This provides a challenge for educators seeking to harnessthe potenial of 'funds' present in home interactions in a morestructured way.

Family Interactions in facilitated spaces

These areas are still distinct from the formal spaces of training. Theyare informal, third spaces as explored earlier.

Facilitation

The value of face-to-face facilitation of family interactions hasexplored from multiple perspectives using a variety of methods, forexample in the work of Roque and Bevan and colleaguesBevanet al., 2015; Roque, 2016).\

When Ouellet at al.2017)studied inter-generational game making they found that some of theirassumptions were erroneous as such

Plowman and colleagues2008)also were puzzled at the ways parents referred to the process of youngerfamily members 'just picking up' digital skills. They looked to guidedparticipation as a framework to explain the learning processes occuringRogoffet al., 1993). They note that while explicit teaching is not present,family members are constantly modelling behaviour.

Culture and context-------------------

Parental facilitation roles are also explored as one of the influences of cultural expectations are explored by Siyahhan and colleagues in a study which used Activity Theory as a framework for to analyse family learning in digital game playing Siyahhan et al., 2010). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blum-Ross and Livingstong locate a history for informal digital trainingin community-based and political training2016).The authors note a move to more individual storytelling, thencreativity, then tech focus of DML, then subsumed by a computingcurriculum focus more in line with hard skills focus of the government.

Livingstone explores the individualisation of the context of communitymedia, and out of school settings provided by extra fundingBlum-Rossand Livingstone, 2016) (explored in Livingstone piece where communitymedia based around social action). She points out that this direction isin keeping with a wider de-contextualisation of learning in schools andthat this trajectory is at odds with the momentum behind contemporaryresearch which emphasises the importance of context in the learningprocess.

The challenge to facilitators to integrate home culture and practices isexplored by Brahms2014)in her study of family learning in the context of a science museums .

The problem of parental involvement from the perspective of schools.

Wider work on the role of parents in digital environments for kids arein depth and instructive. There are class distinctions about who makesdigital contentLivingstoneet al., 2018)

Next Steps

The following tensions or oppositions in the area of family making areof interest to me for future exploration; the difference between soloand group making, less guided exploration compared to more structuredapproaches, approaches to family media making that allow for culturalexploration of material already relevant to the family and widersocietal issues.
