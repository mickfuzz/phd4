Digital making and PBL

The creation of digital artefacts, in this case games, in collaborativefamily units can be seen as an example of project based learning. Manyforms of PBL, both problem and project approaches, rely on the fosteringof a collaborative environment. This involves shifts in behaviour androles students take on more generative, reflective and evaluative tasksand teachers take on a more facilitative roleErtmerand Glazewski, 2015). Both parties can find these new roles challengingand as such many PBL programmes advocate forms of scaffolding to supportthe process of group collaboration and student centred approachesBrushand Saye, 2002). While many of these approaches are non specificallydesigned to support collaboration others designed to aid contentintegration did have this effect. Kolodner and colleagues noted thevalue of using importance of using spaces and processes to make studentlearning visibleKolodneret al., 2004, 2003). While some of these examples use digital spaces,others are more low-tech involving white boards, sticky notes andcollaboratively created mind-map/ relational diagrams.

Making as Empowerment---------------------

Maker Movement overview....

David gauntlet and DIY making, making as a way to pause for thoughtbefore answering or discussing, particularly of interest in terms ofmethods hereGauntlett,2007). Areas for accessibility here too.

Gauntlett celebrates a rich history of making as an empowering activity,drawing on the ethos of William Morris and broadening the scope of toinclude as "everyday creativity" that encompasses self made internetcreations which are shared on internet sites such as YouTube, Flickr andother sharing platforms often refered to as Web 2.0 platforms.

**On Digital Making: T**he potential for empowerment via "DigitalMaking" is explored in a report by Sefton-Green for nominet2013).While the value of digital literacy is promoted by various non profitslinked to digital freedoms,

There is a sense that for Mozilla this was an area that was a fundedstream but which they had limited success as being the home of Webmakingas services like Thimble and Popcorn which were heavily promoted via theWebmaker programme were withdrawn. Presumably as lack of significantuptake meant they did not get ongoing funding.

Sefton-Green explores tensions between informal sites and cultures ofdigital making and attempts to bring this potential into formal sites.This exposes another tension in terms of the suitability of onlinespaces to share and create work.

We can look at the migration of work from Thimble to Glitch.com as oneexample of a move to a more industry focused Code Playground, comparedto a education specific site. We can also compare this to the use byCode Club, (via Raspberry Pi Foundation) of Trinket. All of these toolscan be described as Code Playgrounds, a website where users create,share and remix each others creations which are constructed using commonweb technologies of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

While there is a danger of focusing too much on the toolset andneglecting the process involved, the tools and the community surroundingthem do have potential to be part of the learning experience. This isespecially true if\
