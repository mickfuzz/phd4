This article examines playful virtual worlds, often linked to real life toy objects through a simple sociocultural lens. It specifically looks at scaffolding (via technology design), guided participation (via family members expertise) and mediation (via physical and online artefacts)

The article also references the media mixes of participatory culture and makes explicit mention of the interacting worlds of online and offline characters through the use of commercial toys. This commercialisation of virtual worlds decreases the potential for useful civic engagement made possible by more open Internet participation (Carrington and Hodgetts, 2010).

Which prompts in me the question. How can you provide alternatives which are more civically minded, diy in approach and more likely to lead to richer and more localised exploration of context.

Ideas include mapping what is popular in commercial products and seeing what replacements exist in making cultures. This aspect was deemed particularly important to Mediation in these families.

Ideas include:

-   Hama bead characters as pixel art

-   Making covers for arcade game consoles

-   Remixing art of familiar characters and printing on T shirts or     > incorporating in games

The form of the study involved coded interviews 30-60 of multiple participants, bringing out different aspects listed above. Guided participation as seen in the younger family members picking up how to use tools through observation of peers.
