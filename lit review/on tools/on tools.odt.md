Choice of Tools

From the conclusion of Earp and all that better pedagogic models and construction tools are needed, I would add that more authentic approaches, which allow greater extension of skills are needed in tools

We can contrast tools using the low floors high ceilings and wide walls and new windows here - Javascript in code playgrounds is favourable for many of these, and each can be covered in turn with examples from a pilot study.

**Additional toolsets: **Sonic Pi, Drawing Boards, Beads, Foley recording audio station.

The pedagogical approaches behind the choice of toolset can be linked to the following areas of interest

-   distributed intelligence (especially from an arts / chat background     and the use of boundary objects to externalise tacit knowledge     Cole     et al., n.d.; Fischer et al., 2005). -   experiential learning / design cycle Kolb -- an experimental design     cycle as part of a constructionist tradition kindergarden process     (Resnick, 2007). -
