Should I focus on systems thinking?

There is so much to learn when coding and creating assets that a focus on st would limit observation to later stages. When a working game is up and running. But the process of starting from scratch messes this up.

The broken games approaches are a way to fast track this.

But then you lose a sense of control about what is in the code.

I wonder how fast can you fast track the process of building the code to get to chapter 6. Without losing a sense of what we are doing.

What would the experience of doing that copying and pasting look and feel like.

So what else is being taught? And therefore can be studied and to what aim?

Resnick and Brennan take on ct is so wide but appealing,

And more suited to tinkering than wings

Collaboration, is my current focus but I don't really know what it means. Which needs to be investigated.

Pros is

-   micro collaboration on problem solving of ct when generating new     > features is good to capture via screens.

-   Any sharing between groups is gold

-   Affect of physical artefact creation and iteration very interesting

-   Problem solving for half baked games like puzzles , could be     > iterative and measurable in terms of questioning curiously on     > mentors

-   Deciding on the game theme and using identification with their     > created assets to pull groups together when they break down , is     > interesting but with no control and only enthusiasm of     > facilitators to make it happen , tricky to assess impact beyond     > anecdotal

And is hard to capture in a short time, especially use of on line resources and remixing and sharing of projects.

Creativity is better understood, takes time, but has different levels,

Iinkx to materials and design cycles.

Design thinking, and a focus on language could be very practical. Easier to capture in post interviews, and artefacts ,
