My review of game making studies.  ==================================

### **Games as a way to learn subject material**

***From connected learning - kafai***

**research on learning mathematics**,

see Kafai 1995; - minds in play - mixed methods logs of learning logs

Project Headlight - a class of sixteen fourth-grade students from an inner-city public elementary school as they were programming games in Logo to teach fractions to third graders.

Ke 2014; scratch for maths learning (but also design), for six weeks with two 1-h sessions each week

Schanzer et al. 2015; Bootstrap [[http://www.bootstrapworld.org/]{.underline}](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/) - 3 classes, algebra, pre-post, but not really a game.

Vattel and Riconscente 2012. - doesn't seem accessible -

**For other disciplinary content,**

see Baytak and Land 2010; only 3 children using Game Maker, subject matter also nutrition,

Well cited, but for me

main conclusions are around social learning, and value of student choice rather than anything to do with subject matter

Clark and Sheridan 2010; 139 high school students, game maker, maya 3d, alice, comp savy black kids mainly, survey on attitudes.

DiSalvo et al. 2014; convincing on black kid identity as game testers, but not really subject content

Javidi and Sheybani 2010; - 78 students, variety of tools, quite simplistic results.

Lakanen, Isomöttönen, and Lappalainen 2014; 500 odd, text coding in ms visual studio, 2dgames, focus on **student attitudes\ **students into groups that we named Enthusiasts, Newbies, Uncertains, Ex- perimenters and Unsatisfieds..

Mouza et al. 2014; 25 odd students - Undergraduates & teachers teaching grades 4-6, scratch, for teacher training, - quite simplistic, attitidues to CS, CT concepts, design process.

Robertson 2013; 225 - adventure author, attitudes

Webb, Repenning, and Koh 2012.

**Other Studies - From Roberson 2013**

Meerbaum-salant & Ben-ari, 2013 Learning computer science concepts with Scratch -

18 students, tests and interviews, looking mostly at internalisation of CT concepts.

Denner, Werner & Oritz 2011 - 60 girls over 14 months - stagecast creator - looking at progreamming, organising code, and desiging for usability - I would say that the approach and coding is quite random.

**Other Studies - From Kafai and Burke review**

Survey work mostly with students self reporting.

Links engagement as a vital to CoP - Wegner

Explores Deci & Ryan - self determination theory , positing that certain students respond better to this than others.

Also notes productive failure - Kapur and Kinzer 2009

There is also a sister study on Globaloria - which addresses digital divide positively.
