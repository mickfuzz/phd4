Introduction ------------

This writing traces the foundations, key concepts and influence of the term constructionism when used in a computer education context. Constructionism as a learning theory along with constructivist games and gaming can be traced back to the influential work of Seymour Papert (dates?). Papert, a former student of Piaget, built a legacy around his work at MIT applying the constructivist theories of Papert to the emergent realm of computer education, particularly in the area of geometry.

Papert's interest in the educational value of the production of digital and physical artefacts drove the creation of the LOGO coding language and some associated physical tools, notably drawing Turtles and computational Lego. LOGO was often used to control robotic 'Turtles' which were able to draw patterns on physical paper with attached pens or to create similar digital representations on a computer screen.

Papert's book Mindstorms (date), which explores the possibilities of LOGO and Turtles in the context of ongoing computer clubs, had a significant influence on teaching coding and highlighting possibilities of wider educational possibilities with computers.

This writing explores the foundations of constructionism in the constructivism of Piaget. I then turn to Papert's (date) definitions of constructionism and elaborations of the concepts involved. F*inally extensions of constructionism by his peers are examined and comparisons are made to methodologies with a social/cultural focus (draft only). *

Constructivism  ---------------

To help unfurl the influence of Piaget's constructivism on Papert, I will summarise its foundations. Constructivism in this context refers to a view of the learning process as an active process where the learner constructs knowledge using evolving cognitive structures. There are many variants of constructivist approaches in which the learner has an active role. However, an exploration of these is outside of the scope of this writing, See Duffy and Cunningham(1996) for a review.

Piaget has been credited with evolution of epistemology from a branch of philosophy to a science in its own right (Gruber and Voneche, 1995). Given that so much of his work was to do with the active reconstruction of reality in the minds of the learner, what can we make of Piaget's statement "Je m'en fou de la realite", politely translated as 'I don't give a fig about reality' (Gruber & Voneche, 1995, p. xxiv) Gruber and Vonecher take this to be indicative of the work Piaget has done in translating difficult ontological questions into epistemological concerns that are more easily addressed by educators, for example.... Certainly we can see Piaget's take on epistemology as one whose primary focus is to do with knowledge creation and growth compared with other more philosophical epistemologies concerning 'validity', hence the term genetic epistemology, genetic here concerning genesis of knowledge (Papert, 1980, p. 163).

In terms of methodology, we can see Piaget work as intertwined with the a reaction against the limits of Behaviourism seen by many as a cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). The behaviourist approach to psychology had a focus on empirical observation of measurable behaviour rather than mental processes and thus took place in strictly controlled environments. In this context the overall tag of cognitive is a signifier for mental activity rejected by Behaviourists.

The research methods used by Piaget were extensive naturalistic observation and in depth clinical interview. For him much existing quantitative behavioural testing did not offer useful insight into the psychological processes that most concerned him (LourenÃ§o, 2012).

The interaction between subject and environment underlying Piaget's theory is extremely active and involved. A more straightforward empirical interaction with environment resulting in frictionless learning is something Piaget would reject. Rather he posits constant re-construction of knowledge as a process involving assimilation and accommodation of information by evolving psychological structures.

> In their initial directions, assimilation and accommodation are > obviously opposed to one another, since assimilation is conservative > and tends to subordinate the environment to the organism as it is, > whereas accommodation is the source of changes and bends the organism > to the successive constraints of the environment. (Piaget, 2013)

In this interplay between assimilation of experience into existing structures and the accommodation of forcing interpretative modification learners are normally in a state of equilibrium until they make rapid shifts caused by accommodating new information which does not fit existing structures.

Piaget saw the young learner as the ultimate creator of the progressive of underlying structures and stages rather than inheriting a set of a priori mental stages which unfurl as the child ages. This difference between Piaget's constructivism from a more nativist approach is subtle especially due to Piaget's claim that such a progression of stages is universal (Gruber and Voneche, 1995, p. xxxix).

Papert's Constructionism : Celebrating the Concrete ---------------------------------------------------

The underlying extension that constructionism provides to the base of constructivist view of learning is expressed simply.

> Constructionism\--the N word as opposed to the V word---shares > constructivism\'s connotation of learning as \"building knowledge > structures\" irrespective of the circumstances of the learning. It > then adds the idea that this happens especially felicitously in a > context where the learner is consciously engaged in constructing a > public entity, whether it\'s a sand castle on the beach or a theory of > the universe (Harel and Papert, 1991).

Ackermann's (2001) exploration of the similarities between constructivism and constructionism views the latter's focus as the way learners identify and accommodate new information thus creating new internal representations of the world. Papert's modified conception of the underlying structures concerned with knowledge creation as a dynamic process than Piagets one of stages of relative equilibrium.

Papert lamented external focus on Piaget's stages as he thought it deflected attention from his extensive and detailed studies of the more dynamic processes involved in concrete discovery (Papert, 1980).

We now describe areas of particular interest to Papert in the construction of learning through concrete experience. A selection of principles which are most re-occurrent in his writing and relevant to the construction of digital artefacts are presented.

### An Object Oriented Approach to Learning

For Papert the process of externally working on physical and digital artefacts enabled learners to project their ideas about the world onto tangible objects. In doing so, the process of learning takes on a conversational character, each iteration and experiment deepening experience and observations, hence the user of the term *objects to think with* (Ackermann, 2004).

Objects also provide the possibility of 'syntonic' connection between the learner and the object they are working as contrasted to a more distanced, academic approach (Papert, 1980, p. 63). To clarify, a drawing Turtle controlled can be seen as body-syntonic as the learner can imagine their bodies in place of that of the Turtle. Papert's contention is that this increases learner motivation and connection with the learning experience.

Papert also evokes the power of emotional connections with objects involved in the learning process (Turkle, 2007). This is communicated via Papert's description of his childhood love of the gears (Papert, 1993). This physicality and individual exploration of the object is inherently part of this love.

### Hard and Soft Approaches

The distinction between hard and soft approaches to learning is explored particularly in studies refuting conceptions that there is a right way to do computer coding. (Papert and Turkle, 1990).

In this context, the hard approach infers a top-down perspective, highlighting advance planning and logical deconstruction of large problems. Papert and Turkle (1990) identify the privileging of abstract thinking over concrete approaches in classroom teaching, a tendency which is mirrored by recent conceptions and advancement of computational thinking as teaching ideology (Wing, 2008). They identify? different, softer but equally effective coding strategies. Soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner directed connection with the materials or digital artefacts involved. The learner is presented as adapting a familiar set of concepts and processes to new situations and challenges as they arise as a 'tinker' might use well-worn tools to skilfully bodge a repair job (Papert, 1993, p. 143).

### The Power Principle and Microworlds

Papert's concept of Microworld is of particular interest for designer of educational environments. Microworlds are designed spaces which act as incubators for certain kinds of learning. His criteria for Microworlds are that they should give examples of the chosen subject learning, bring all needed concepts inside the Microworld and that there should be footholds for the end user to put this kind of learning to use in their interaction with the world (Papert, 1980, p. 126).

Microworlds embody the principle that for a concept to progress beyond your existing knowledge, you must use it, play with it to find out more and assimilate or accommodate your findings into your world view (Ackermann, 2001). The - use it before you understand it -- concept is articulated by Papert as the 'power principle' (Papert, 1996).

### Project before Problem 

Papert strongly advocated a project-based approach and hid commitment to it is deeply embedded in his ethnographic studies. Project approaches and particularly the social aspects of constructionism are explored in more detail in the following section.

*My impression is that while Papert's commitment to project based approach is present throughout his writing he didn't cover it in a holistic sense. I would need to do more reading about this and expose it as a potential weakness in comparison to CoP and CHAT* *approaches.. *

Exploring Social Aspects of Constructionism -------------------------------------------

There are aspects of Papert's observations of the social and situated aspects of learning communities which show strong affinity with socio-cultural schools of learning *(Cole and EngestrÃ¶m, 2007; Vygotsky, 1978).* Specifically, these affinities are clearly present in this descriptions of a Samba School where he describes the learning opportunities available through theme based, communal projects undertaken by a community of learners and teachers (Zagal and Bruckman, 2005).

While we can see that Papert's focus on the concrete, non-abstract knowledge is sympathetic to the idea of situated learning, he should not be seen as in agreement with an entirely externally situated view of cognition as he would "allow the situating of knowledge in internalized, mental environments to act in much the same way as situated in external, physical environments" (Harel and Papert, 1990, p. 24).

Indeed, despite his highlighting of the potential for social learning sharing learning around constructing objects together, Papert's ethnographic studies show a higher value attached to the learning journey of individuals as they overcome obstacles and find ways to accommodate new understandings (Ackermann, 2010).

*This section is weak and incomplete. It requires a lot more reading and time rewriting than I have time for now. I wanted to include it as it links to the conclusion I want to make which is that there are other promising theories out there that have great potential for more detailed studies of game making communities. . *

*Draft/ Incomplete -- Extending Constructionism * -------------------------------------------------

*Constructionism has been adopted and extended particularly by community of practitioners based at MIT whose primary focus is computational technologies in education. Kafai and Resnick have been particularly influential in promoting an adapted version of Constructionism applied to the design and study of computational environments (Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996). *

*Resnick has also to develop the sophistication and accessibility of the design heuristics advanced by Papert (Resnick et al., 2005, 2000; Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013). *

*The direction of travel of Kafai's work has been to draw in the wider frameworks of computational thinking, communities of practice and participatory culture, reworked as "computational participation". It is not clear to me how much this approach genuinely adds to the original proposition of constructionist concepts. *

*Draft/ Incomplete - Conclusion * ---------------------------------

*Both Papert's constructionism and Piaget's constructivism draw heavily on the use of observation and interviews. Papert defends the observational nature of his research for subject learning is deeply entangled with the complex learning environment. He is critical of the methodologies seeking to isolate factors in the introduction of LOGO to schools from other more environmental aspects. Given the emergent medium, Papert's contestation that the introduction of computers allows for radical new ways of learning about subjects and that thus multiple factors a necessity in observing change appears valid (Papert, 1987). Accordingly, Papert argues strongly for an ethnographic methods as a way of avoiding a reductionist, decontexualising approach (Papert, 1990). *

*However, there is also validity in criticism that wider methods would be beneficial in the exploration of the effects of microworlds like LOGO on learners (Walker, 1987). Certainly an approach using mixed methods would be welcome beyond pure ethnographic interpretation which is common to much of his dissemination of research. *

*Rather than the approach taken by Kafai to cherry pick amongst promising contemporary theories and rebrand them in an updated meta-framework, I would be more interested in looking at Activity Theories and Network Theories to provide richer possibilities for mixed method approaches. *

*In conclusion, we should take Papert at his word and approach constructionism more as a set of concrete learning and design approaches than as an overarching research framework or methodology. *
