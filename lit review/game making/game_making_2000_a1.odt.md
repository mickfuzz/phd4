An overview of literature on Game Design

My proposed study is on the role of collaboration in digital game makingintergenerational learning contexts. It will therefore require anextensive exploration of the literature concerning game making in alearning. What follows is a review of literature with a focus on theimportance of systems approach to learning environments concerning gamemaking.

Digital or Non- Digital

Before jumping in, a quick word to say that while my choice to usedigital games, specifically 2d video games as a learning medium ( achoice justified elsewhere in the study), does effect the focus of thefollowing exploration of concepts, many of them are transferrable tonon-digital mediums.

Technological determinism -- how does this effect the learning andmotivation -- issues around the attention medium of choice vs. this isnot really important to the learning of systems.

While there are issues of cost and complexity of digital approacheswhich can be barriers to game design processWhitton,2012), the reduced cost of 2^nd^ hand computers and open source gamedesign frameworks are helping to alleviate this.

Distinction of Making vs Playing

Following constructivist princiiples we may imagine a higher potentialof making. However, while there are many studies on game playing andjustifications of learning that is happening -- Jenkins, Gee, Romero,etc, - but less on game making. Why is this, when the potential ispotentially larger

Earpet al., n.d.)?

Salen who explores game making are keen not to devalue playing elementswith an assumption that "to be a full participant, one must alsoproduce."Salen,2007, p. 308). Production is value as just one form of participationthat can build wider skills explored in the next section. One feels thatin part this is needed to prevent the "just playing games" criticismthat can be levelled at this area.

While, it may be true that the analysis and commentary of games builds arich ecology of learner participation, for the purposes of this studythere are learning which I do believe are better suited to directproduction, and better suited to a non-formal but still guided approach.

Purpose of Game Making

Setting the path for the following

How to set a pathway for the following ideas and frameworks?

What about the "rules, play and culture framework"Salenand Zimmerman, 2003, p. 4).

In this writing, we'll concentrate mostly on rules and play. They notethat the framework can be applied to wider contexts than game design.

Other frameworks of gaming literacies exist which have a wider focus oncritical approaches and multiple literacies as well as culturesA.Peppler and B. Kafai, 2009; Buckingham and Burn, 2007). These works aimto build on media literacy and production frameworks in this emergingarea.

Systems design and Games Design in a nutshell

Summary of design, systems, learning and games

Design and learning -- kafai minds in play, Chapter one .

Kafai notes a convergence of design and learning theoriesKafai,1995).

Games as a design. - summary of what is a game, and what are the designelements,

use of this in the playing of games -- but especially in the making

Salen covers high level work on games, rules, prototypesSalen,2007).

Salen outlines the reflection in action of Shoen, and the link ofprocess driven and reflective design approach.

Systems approach non-digital and digital -- what's the difference here?

The work of Roberston on Adventure Author required understanding of thecreative process stages to support each oneRobertsonand Nicholson, 2007). These are detailed as; exploration, ideageneration, game design, game implementation, game testing andevaluation.

The stages are drawn from a mix of design fields including generalcreative process support, commercial game design and software design.

The author recognise the tension between the utility if discreet stagesand the iterative nature of the process . The value of iteration is akey feature of the work of Schoen which appears throughout theliterature on learning and designSchon,1984).

Iteration is also at the heard of Resnick's model for creative designwhich was created in parallel with the Scratch tool.Resnick,2008, 2007)

While this model applies not just to game making as wanted to extent toother tinkering media projects, it grew out of that domain.

Linking to wider model of computational thinking and applying to theareas of moldelling, game design and robotics, this white paper advancesa model of Use, Modify and CreateAllanet al., n.d.) .

The three-dialog model of game design literacy

Material, Real player and Ideal playerGames,2008).

The real and ideal players reference the "virtual, real and projective"identities put forward by GeeGee,2003, p. 54).

Ideal player -- is a useful construct to aid design and helping thedesigner imagine the virtual player that the real player will projectthemselves into.

Materials components of games come with their own affordences that areoften complex,

This dialogue is important for the game or learning environment

A framework for applying systems analysis and creation to youthworkshops

The very complex break down of systems involved in the creation of gamesblends an acacdemic approach with a more pragmatic designers rules ofthumb (heuristics) -- then more basic frameworks are needed to transmitideas to families.

Thus if we are going to to communicate the core concepts a reducedframework is required. Torres advances such a framework in his work onGameStar Mechanic incorporating : "space, rules, core mechanics,components and goals"Torres,n.d., p. 111).

He advocates the use of these specialist terms in game creation workshopas supported by the work of Hmelo, et al., 2000
