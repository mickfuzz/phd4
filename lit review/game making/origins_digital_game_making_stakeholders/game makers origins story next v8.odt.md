Threads of Digital Game Use in Education========================================

Introduction------------

This writing traces the foundations and various influences of currentlandscape of digital games and education. Inspired by the approach ofthe Platform Studies series of books on the impact of various video gameplatforms, I have found it useful to use lenses of culture, technologyand economics in reviewing literature of this areaBogostand Montfort, 2009). While the following analysis has a primary focus onthe cultural motivations for the use of games in education, the examplesof specific groups using or making games for learning illustrate howtechnological and economic factors are intertwined with culturaldrivers.

For brevity, I will use the term digital games based learning (DGBL) asan umbrella term. Eck divides DGBL approaches into three areas; studentsbuilding games from scratch, bespoke learning games designed byprofessionals and commercial-off-the-shelf games (COTS) integrated intoclassroomsEck,2006).

COTS games in this context are commercial-off-the-shelf games designedfor entertainment that educators integrate into learning experiences. DeFreitas2007)defines the distinction between COTS and serious games being that theprimary purpose of a serious game is to support formal learningoutcomes.

While a review of of digital games for learning or a serious gamesConnollyet al., 2012), includes a separate categories for serious games andsimulation (addressed later), a later review reinforced noted thesynonymous use of the terms and subsequently disregarded as distinctionBoyleet al., 2016).

Connolly's initial review notes the diversity of approaches and desiredoutcomes and represents them a model adapted from the work of Garris ancolleagues2002).The model consists of three main of targeted learning and behaviouraloutcomes for educational games, namely; technical or motor skills,cognitive abilities (declarative, procedural, strategic), and affective/motivational outcomes. The author also highlights the limitations ofthis categorisation and a more general lack of an existing unifiedapproach to measurement of the outcomes of game based learning andrecommends more research in this area.

Mayer2012))notes the complex use of terminology in the area of digital games andsuggests a framing, rather than definition, of terms to allow for anon-exclusive methods of giving context to meaning dependant on thesub-communities that use them. Here I use framing of loosely associatedschools of thought to bring to the foreground their preoccupations andassociated tensions in their use of digital games. These schools are thestudy of digital games in a literacy context, games as commerciallearning products and games as a focus for educational researchers andpractitioners.

Game playing as a new form of literacy ---------------------------------------

This school of approach is inspired by early work by Gee and Jenkins andthe work surrounding New Literacies schools.

The more specific area of media literacy embraces the study of computergames in a context of emerging digital literacy skillsBuckinghamet al., 2005).

This is wides in scope extending beyond explicitly educational games toembrace wider ecologies and practices of game playing and modding(explored later).

Jenkins sees a faultline between motivations of game designers on theexperience of play with the educators concern for 'representing content'Freitasand Maharg, 2011, p. xxiv). Whilst not coming at this from a simplistic,dualistic viewpoint he notes the difficulty of translating the openended aims of good commercial games to a school environment whereeducational games start with prescribed aims and objectives. The dangerbeing that the play is crushed out of the games.

Many have pushed for the value of letting the play be play and seeingwhat learning comes of itIt≈ç,2010). This value of the associated meaning making in game playingcommunity activities often involving diy media production associatedwith it has been termed participatory culture and is explored more in alater section game makingJenkins,2009).

There is an attraction of large complex learning environments fornaturalistic researchersTaylor,2009). This approach is quite fluffy and certainly doesn't suitmeasurable outcomes rather than a study of learner experience.

Learning in COTS games is advocated especially in the context of complexgames that require a significant investment in player time. One exampleis outlined by Stewart of the use of strategy, media creation and mathsin 'crafting' practices in MMORGSFreitasand Maharg, 2011, p. 111). Stewart terms this learning Stealth Learningand describes it an unintended learning which is hard to quantify orpredict.

Digital games as bespoke instructional products-----------------------------------------------

This sections explores games as a vehicle for more direct instruction oflearners. Where to best first contrast this?

We can also compare this use of the term stealth learning to the morequestionable use of it in in other contexts as a games as a sugar pillto trick learners into ingesting prescribed educational contentPrensky,2005). The authour describes a *Holy Grail* of making dull learningincluding the process of data retention more exciting. Critics of thisapproach highlight the simplistic and ineffective pedagogical approachof the majority of DGBL which favour information recall activitiesbolted on to entertainment gamesEck,2006).

Conversely, Eck and other authours highlight the potential for seriousgames and simulations to surpass drill and practice approaches and tofacilitate higher learning levelsEck,2006; Gee, 2003; Whitton, 2009).

Gee is highlights that as long as game elements are well preserved. Heuses a war simulations as an example of good practice in creating aneffective instructional gameGee,2005).

Simulations

From its industry training origins Serious Games have a tendency towardssimulations including health care, military, national policy budgetingDjaoutiet al., 2011; Michael and Chen, 2005; Sawyer and Smith, 2008).

The former of which has a higher propensity to be simulation based. DeFreitas in her introduction notes the longer history of simulations andasks are simulations games. De Freitas contends that while they havedifferent histories, roles and feedback mechanisms they are starting toconverveFreitasand Maharg, 2011, p. 3).

The goal is to represent reality.

They are often less immersive that COTS .

**The economy of serious games **

It is easy to be sceptical of commercial market based drive. But thereare many contextual factors that can't be ignored that presentopportunities beyond commercial exploitation including the appropriationof hardware or market mechanics for other purposesSawyerand Smith, 2008).

There is a tendency to over evangelise the effectiveness of thisapproach. In a report by the Serious Games Initiative they marvel thatat the same time as the emergence of many wicked or messy problems thesolution comes in "paradoxically in a package that could hardly havelooked neater"Tucker,2012, p. 2). Tucker here champions games as interactive systems whichmirror the systems of policy decision making. SGI game Budget Hero is anexample of this. The goal here is normally to leverage governmentfunding on key issues to create games based on medium of attention formillenials argument.

Measurement and Capitalist ideology in education and social change

One particular area of the Serious Games Movement which has particularissues with concerning measurement of effect is that of Games forChange. Designers like Mc Gonnigal sees great potential for socialchange in gamesMcGonigal,2011). The laudable ambition to create games which can create a*measurable difference in the present state of reality*McGonigal,2007).

This study looks at the methodologies for measuring effectiveness andnotes a huge diversity in approachMayer,2012). As per Conolly review as well. Pre and post test are common butmeasuring individual learning from games is problematic, and measuringsocial change even more so.

As a counterpart to the more general move towards performance indicatorsin education driven by market ideologyApple,2001), we can see impact evaluation in funded social change projects asa discourse directed by funding organisationsGertleret al., 2016). The focus on measurement which is part of the seriousgames and games for change as a need for justification of fundingallocation.

We can question wether this goes beyond the normal desire for rigour ofresearch to become too simplistic and skewed to lower order learning(see Gee and Whitton's comparison for higher order), in order to gainquicker results.

As a conclusion, research needs to go deeper. Link to next section

Game playing as focused educational experience----------------------------------------------

If we can see one of the primary drives of the Serious Games Movement asproduction of software products which produce measurable learning, wecan contrast this with a school of educational researchers andpractitioners who focus more on the social and cultural aspects oflearner experience using gamesFreitasand Maharg, 2011).

Here the teacher can be seen as orchestrating learning experience. Thisfocus thus widens to include the learning ecology around the game ratherthan the game as a self contained product.

This broader focus and the hybrid possibilities it brings adds newelements into the discourse surrounding the use of games for learning.

To return to the issue of stealth learning as defined by Steward asunintentional learning, there exists the difficulty of translating thisapproach to formal schooling. In such environments with where aprescribed content is required by a curriculum driven approach, skilfulmatching of the game and outcome is essentialWhitton,2009). de Freitas2007,p. 8) cautions against inefficient use of games, advocating 'operatingfrom learning outcomes and objectives and not just being used as a breakin the learning'.

Educational games face practical problems of the cost and developmenttime of the computer games that they compete againstWhittonand Hollins, 2008). This results in limitations of the end product interms of productions values and negative perceptions of learnersJenkins,2002).

Modding is an alternative to be exploreddeFreitas, 2007). Especially in chapter 4 by Francis featuring Neverwinternights and history modsFreitasand Maharg, 2011, p. 87)

Shaffer and epistemic games, moving the theory of Gee into a morestructured and supported environment. While an overlap with simulationexists here, the game making element is still strongShaffer,2006).

Motivational Claims Examined in Educational Context

One of the key ways this school is different from DBGL evangelists istheir more moderated approach to the issue of games as a motivationalfactor.

PrenskyPrensky,2005, 2001) - made the DGBL term popular as an enthusiast and advocate.While this enthusiasm was welcome in a hostile environment to videogames in particular certain of key ideas around digital natives concepthave been later evaluated by educational researchers and found wanting.Claims around types of learning needed by younger generations that haveyet to be supported by evidenceBennettet al., 2008; Helsper and Eynon, 2010).

The unqualified advocacy of the use of games as a motivational factorand vehicle for stealth learning is also challenged by researchersWhitton,2008, 2007). The study in question posits that while many learners see apotential value in games as part of a learning process, this is trueprimarily when they see the games in question as being the mosteffective way of learning specific material or skills.
