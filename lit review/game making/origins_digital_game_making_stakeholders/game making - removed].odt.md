Adult preparation for making computer games

There is a distinction between AAA games and more indy game makingcourses. The first would have a more vocational, industry focusedapproach learning a particular tool chain or industry definedspecialism, while the second approach can take a step back and explorewider concepts of game making that transcend particular mediums.

-   Engineering and design processes-   Understanding of game systems and mechanics-   Programming skills & computational thinking practices
