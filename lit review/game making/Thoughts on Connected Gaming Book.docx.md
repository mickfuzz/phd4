Thoughts on Connected Gaming Book =================================

On page 11 on intro - an extension of Wing's def of computational thinking to a more **collective vision of production. **

**Creating Collective Game creation environments**

What studies have there been for Game Jams for young people?

What is the sweet spot here about being in control, and close to the metal, and creating something that you are proud to show in a normal context?

**Choice of Tools**

**Making computing and game making more physical - **

Tactics include

-   The making of the arcade controls

-   Creating patches of code that have to be sewn together

-   Games using frisbees, bean bags / sock balls/ to recreate the game     > mechanics of arcade games

**Teaching Physics through Arcade Physics**

Where are there comparisons to the real world and where do they fail?

**Gender Bias & 2D representations**

Modding Games to change sprites and similar subversions
