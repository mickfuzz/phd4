*This writing is a potential extract from my literature review, as such, some concepts that would have previously explored in literature around game playing and Digital Game-Based Learning will have already been explored. I will make reference to those in this extract when there is a cross over between the pedagogy of game playing and game making. *

Overview of Game Making Studies by Learning Outcomes  =====================================================

In this writing I will look at research categorised by underlying educational motivations for making games in a learning context, namely; the deep learning of subject content, creative and design approaches (specifically to understand making games), learning computer coding, facilitating collaboration and communication, and finally game making as an accessible way to promote access to technology, particularly for girls.

By including any one study in these categories I do not wish to imply that it applies to this area exclusively. Kafai and Burke eschew the simplicity of a similar categorisation in a review by Hayes and Games, noting that there is a lot of crossover in any such division Y. B. Kafai and Burke, 2014). While acknowledging this limit, I propose that this approach has practical merits to examine the details of research.

Games as a way to learn subject material across the curriculum --------------------------------------------------------------

In a seminal study which extended one of the original goals of LOGO, to create worlds where students could interact with math content in a tangible way Papert, 1980), Kafai used the process of constructing a game in the LOGO language to encourage students at teach and fractions and scientific concepts 1994). Through detailed analysis of student learning logs and pre post test Kafai found students were better able to communicate the concepts behind the mathematical concepts about which they had made educational games 1998). One notable findings and concern of this study was that often the content was integrated in games extrinsically rather than being integral to game play Kafai et al., 1998). Students get so wrapped up in the concrete challenge of making a game that deeping and researching the content is neglected. We can excuse our novice games designers this, indeed, this critique has often been levelled at professional educational games producers.

The use of game design activites to support learning of non-computing curriculum subjects also has precedent in the areas of maths , english language skills Burke, 2012; Owston et al., 2009; Robertson and Good, 2005), nutrition Baytak and Land, 2010), science Kangas, 2010) and history Squire et al., 2005), .

Squire conducted 'longitudinal, 2-year design-based research study investigating the potential of learning communities constructed around Civ3 to help disadvantaged students develop new identities as producers as well a consumers of historical simulation games.' Durga and Squire, 2011)

The study of of the use of the game modification process made possible in the game Civilisation Squire, 2005) includes findings that indicate a more complex understanding of multiple factors at play in historical situations as an outcome of playing and most importantly re-designing the computer simulation.

Squire and colleagues also outlines the process of moving from player to designer and describing the resultant shifts in persective Squire et al., 2005). This work is followed by later studies on emergent learning communities discussion the modding Civilisation Owens, 2011; Squire and Giovanetto, 2008), we can however question the time commitment needed to apply this to wider educational use.

A review by Moreno-Leon and Robles of studies looking beyond the study programming in itself using the Scratch visual programming language Moreno-Le√≥n and Robles, 2016). Here the authors, see promise in studies that integrate programming activities into wider curriculum to support subject learning and which show evidence of the wider practices including problems solving and creativity. For subject material these include maths (), english language arts(),

However the authors are also clear that most studies in the area do not conform with certain aspirations in social science research as outlined by Cohen and colleagues Cohen et al., 2011) specifically the group sizes are relatively small, studies often lack control groups and there are few pre and post tests .

The limits of other key studies used to support the case for the promise of game making to support subject knowledge, particularly those in Kafai and Burke's review 2015) should also be examined. While Kafai own game making studies are rich in data and participants, many others of those cited often have extremely limited user base. This is most notable in the case of a widely cited study by Baytak and Land which focused on only three participants 2010). Other studies are only partial in the extent of testing subject knowledge acquisition or deepening of knowledge. In particular, while Kafai and Burke, as advocates for game making, include studies to supply weight of argument of the use of games making to promote subject knowledge, many of the original authours are often cautious about this and often highlight other other skill acquisition as a more primary learning activity Baytak and Land, 2010; DiSalvo et al., 2014; Ke, 2014; Schanzer et al., n.d.). It is also striking that a study by Oswton which did quantify subject based skills in English language arts had mixed results in this area while more promising results in the wider area of digital fluency Owston et al., 2009).

Games as a way to learn programming -----------------------------------

A rich tradition of using games to learn programming has its origins in the creation of the LOGO language and subsequent studies incorporating game making and digital art creation Papert, 1980). Papert's concept of using LOGO language to control Microworlds, digital realms with digital objects with physical characteristics to make more concrete the process of learning object oriented approaches to computer coding still influences game making tool designs including the Game Maker and the Scratch tools Overmars, 2005; Resnick et al., 2009).

Observations on the acquisition of computing concepts through game making are found in a numerous studies Al-Bow et al., 2009; Boechler et al., 2014; Howland and Good, 2015; Reynolds and Caperton, 2011; Stolee and Fristoe, 2011). The have also been a great number of software tools and adaptations of existing tools specifically promote the learning to of programming concepts. Beyond the previously mentioned, Game Maker and Scratch, these include: Agent Sheets and Cubes A. Repenning, 2013; Repenning et al., 2015), Alice Kelleher et al., 2007), Stagecast Creator Smith et al., 2000), Toon Talk Adamson et al., 2002; Kahn et al., 2004), Kodu Touretzky et al., 2013), RPG Maker Weitze, 2016),

What follows is a deeper look at particular studies which have taken a systematic and in-depth look at game making used as a vehicle primarily to build skills in CT and programming.

Definitions of computational thinking or learning become more sophisticated but are starting to stabilise Grover and Pea, 2013; Werner et al., 2014). These can be summarised as creating abstracted structures, systematic approaches, use of symbol systems, sequencing, problem decomposition (modularising), iterative and parallel thinking, conditional logic and debugging.

While there the pedagogical benefits of grounded, endocentric activity to facilitate the acquisition of CT skills have long been advanced, most activities designed to teach CT are still closed, abstracted exercises Grizioti and Kynigos, 2018). The authours note the suitability of game making as a grounded activity.

The promise of game making here in particular compared to other media construction is key. A study of game making in Scratch showed more computational concepts used than other media making activities Adams and Webster, 2012).

The 'Use-Modify-Create' approach proposed by Lee and colleagues 2011) is particularly promising to counter issue of user anxiety surrounding the difficulty of coding games. It comes from the desire to be able to integrate game making and robotics to support computational thinking and draws upon grounded game making studies Denner et al., 2014, 2012; Werner et al., 2014, 2013).

The model advocates the remixing of existing games to act as a scaffold to build the competence of the beginner coder. Learners are guided to progress in the complexity of their modifications, thus becoming increasing proficient in the recognition and use of computational concepts and structures Lee et al., 2011). The concept of 'half-baked' games, which are incomplete or somehow deficient in a way which motivates learners to delve into the code and improve them offers a possible enchancement to the 'Use-Modify-Create' model Kynigos, 2007; Kynigos and Yiannoutsou, 2018). The focus of half-baked games is to design them in a way which encourages malleability of the code in directions that the learner may find interesting. Thus the original game designer makes complex decisions which highlight certain affordances of the game in a way which encourages the exploration of key concepts, in this case computational thinking. Kynigos and Yiannoutsou identify a progression in the type of CT skills being used as the processing of modifying the game progresses as part of the Use-Modify-Create model moving from elements like pattern recognition associated with reading of code to ones like a creating abstracted structures and sequencing their own algorithms. Kynigos also highlights the possibilities of half-baked artefacts to build learner dialogue around the problems at hand as as 'a communicational tool to shape a common language within the community' 2007, p. 336). Elements of learning designs to support dialogue are explored in a later section of this writing.

The prescriptive and categorisable nature of CT would seem to suit rigorous assessment. y Werner and Denner built an ambitious assessment elements into a two year programme using Alice to make games. They built a software tool to quantify the levels of computational thinking, using a structure of thinking algorithmically, the use of design patterns and then combination of those patterns into large game mechanics Werner et al., 2014, 2012). This mirrors work done to automatically analyse Scratch project to assess levels of Computational Thinking Hoover et al., 2016). Here by contrast, analysis is undertaken using framework of use of computer language syntax and data types rather than game mechanic concepts and other code pattern usage.

While ambitious and grounded in approach, it is hard to imagine how this process could be automated, certainly, but also effectively done manually, as it prescribes a particular approach which may not suit all coders. Variations in coding approaches touch on a tensions in conceptions of computational thinking and practice. Using examples from the Scratch tool, Brennan and Resnick 2012) propose a model of CT which identifies concepts, practices and perspectives. While this is in essence similar to formal model of CT, in keeping with a constructionist approach, the language and approach is much more concrete and accessible suiting a 'soft', flexible, ground up approach to coding Papert and Turkle, 1990, p. 166). Indeed, the propensity for Scratch to allow users to jump in and start coding has been criticised as a danger leading to badly structured code which shows fragmentation and 'excessive decomposition' Meerbaum-Salant et al., 2011, p. 171).

Brennan and Resnick 2012), also note the limitations of scraping, automated analysis of CT as it can evaluate only on the product and not the practice or perspectives of users. They also note that the reuse of code common in the game remixing practice can skew assessment. Designers may include working code that they do not truly understand.

Systems thinking and design thinking as gaming literacies ---------------------------------------------------------

Games are complex systems made up on interrelated variables Akcaoglu, 2014). Systems thinking is a key part of game design and the professional habits of game design Salen, 2007). Broadly speaking we can define systems thinking as having the following key concern, that a systems is made up of interdependent parts, thus each variable has importance impact on the other parts. In the scope of game design this is manifested in the aspects of interplay of game elements and mechanics Zimmerman, 2008).

We can see an overlap between systems thinking and computational thinking in that the area of pattern recognition and developing code modularity. Indeed Werner and colleagues work, as describe above, take the development of systemic game mechanics as a proxy for advanced CT 2014).

Beyond the development of coding proficiency and systems thinking, certain researchers have expressed the importance of design thinking as an important skill which can be engendered by the process of game making Games and Squire, 2008; Razzouk and Shute, 2012; Zimmerman, 2008). Zimmerman brings the process of learning to think like a designer together with systems analysis and play into a concept of gaming literacies 2008).

Design methodology and practice is a wide area spanning many disciplines but the foundational concepts many areas have in common can be described as an iterative process, focus on practical goals and projects and a studio approach which values the hands-on mastery of tools as part of a community of practice Hetland et al., 2013; Hokanson, 2013; Hokanson and Gibbons, 2014). Denham and Guyotte 2018) explicitly link game design with wider with arts based practice and points to the value of reflection in an iterative design-based approach.

We can see the preoccupation with design, iteration and reflective practices through-out game making studies and the methodologies of the game making tools that support them. The developer of Scratch, Resnick outlines an iterative spiral design process linked to his conception of a kindergarden learning process 2007). Roberson and Nicholson innovate a similar, progressive design method Robertson and Nicholson, 2007). Recall also the Use-Modify-Create approach Lee et al., 2011) which Kynigos argues is key to an effective scaffolding enabling participants to effectively learn programming Kynigos, 2015).

A particularly useful tool to study in relation to gaming literacies is Gamestar Mechanic (GSM). GSM is an online software specifically designed to communicate and build systems thinking and design thinking through the process of making video games. Several studies on systems thinking draw on the development and implementation of GSM Games, 2009; Games and Squire, 2008; Gee et al., 2008; Shute and Torres, 2012; Torres, 2009). Two key lines of approach here are the product of the doctoral theses of Games and Torres who worked on the GSM project as part of a implementation of a game making programme called Quest to Learn. Quest to Learn is a specialist secondary school in New York whose curriculum has been designed to foster new digital literacies through the embrace of systems thinking. Quest to Learn has learning through game making and analysis as a key part of its curriculum Tekinba≈ü et al., 2010).

The focus of the research of Games 2009; 2008) is on discourse analysis of the processes by which novices learn to be come and think like professional game makers, specifically the process of learning design thinking. For him the development of a profession language of game making is key and is explored through participants functional use of terms when describing how games work such as, core mechanics, rules, space, goals, componentsGee et al., 2008).

Meanwhile, Torres 2009) focuses more explicitly on the development of systems thinking using analysis of game making and associated activities embedded in the GSM. His research identifies four key concepts of systems thinking including; the concepts that many interrelated elements make up aÔªø game system, the importance of different kinds of positive and negative feedback loops, analysis of the quality of links between within a system element and the concept that similar dynamics can exist in unrelated systems.

FINDINGS? This work is supported by a preliminary and a later more in-depth evaluation of the Quest to Learn programme Shute et al., 2012; Shute and Torres, 2012).

In their assessment of systems thinking in middle school students making games using the Alice tool, Werner and colleagues Werner et al., 2014) see students progress beyond listing structural elements of systems to include understanding of their behavioural and functional interactions. Following Hmelo-Silver and Pfeffer 2004) they contend that more advanced students use mental models as an aid to create complex, dynamic responses to ill-formed problems and thus propose a problem-based learning approach.

This link between a deeper understanding of systems thinking and the value of a project based approach brings us back to the issue of the tensions between the value of adopting a professional approach to learning and the difficulties of adopting such an approach in mainstream education. The process of thinking like a game designer encompasses a complexity of interrelated activities. Participation in these activities makes up a community ecosystem, be it in a workplace or learning programme, which can be described as a community of practice Wenger, 1998). The work of Lave and Wenger 1991) around legitimate peripheral participation and situated practice as a way of increasing access to a community is relevant to our next section and is explored later in this writing.

Game making and accessibility -----------------------------

This section encompasses studies addressing race, gender and other issues of accessibility. The process of reviewing studies based on accessibility is complicated by issues of reporting. In their review of game making studies Kafai and Burke 2015) note only half studies include data on gender and race of participants. As such, rather than attempting large scale analysis, I will draw out key issues from notable studies in game making and also related studies on the process of attracting under-represented populations to computer science programmes.

The use of of the tool Adventure Authour to explore and develop narrative and literacy skills of was also used as a case study to look at gender issues in game making Robertson, 2012).

-   Girls Coding GCG-- Denner -- Storytelling Alice

-   Rapunsel -- Flannagan -- via Hayes and Games -   Black students game making and testing -- Glitch project -- diSalvo

Wider issue of of access to computers from disadvantaged communities, digital divide, access to resources. Whitton looks as ways to avoid high cost solutions in the use of games in education and notes the use of free game making tools compared to higher cost solutions 2012). Certainly replicability due to cost issues may well be a factor if we looking at the use of some game making programmes. For example, Quest to Learn incorporates game consoles and commercial software like Little Big Planet in their Sports for the Mind programme Khan, 2014).

One factor common to many of the studies listed above is the importance of engendering student engagement and sustaining motivation. While a common theme in writing about game making and game based learning in general that computer games as a medium of attention for young people promote greater engagement in learning, studies which convincingly support this broad statement are rare or mostly anecdotal Alexander Repenning, 2013; Repenning et al., 2015). This is may often be due to practical reasons of lack of scale and control groups.

There is convincing data from studies on the process of attracting under-represented populations to computer science programmes or STEM in general. A programme making games linked with campaigns using Scratch evidenced increased interest in computer science at college level among black and hispanic particpants Ryoo et al., 2013).

Reynolds and Chiu 2016) assess the effectiveness of the Globaloria game making programme to reduce digital divide effects through a study involving 38 middles schools in the US. Results showed a closing of gaps in attainment for race and gender factors after taking part in the programme. Noting Hargittai's 2010) observations of lower computer skills of Black and Hispanics, women and those from lower socio-economic groups, the authors see this a notable evidence of the programmes success.

Provoking collaboration, reflection, communication and other new literacies ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THERE IS A BRIDGE THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THE LAVE AND WEGNER -- COP ABOVE IN GAME DESIGN AND SHAFFER'S EPISTEMIC GAMES AND GEE'S PROFESSIONAL DISCOURCES -- OR MOVE SOME OF THE BELOW ABOVE AND RECAP IN INTRO HERE, AND MOVE QUICKLY ON TO SPECIFICS OF C21 SKILLS

ALSO DESIGN THINKING COVERS A LOT OF THE C21 SKILLS SO THIS NEEDS TO BE JUSTIFIED.

This section is a bit of a catch all, for wider C21, skills Bermingham et al., 2013)

In an analysis of wider frameworks Voogt and Roblin, 2012), twenty first century skills have been summarised as collaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social/cultural skills & citizenship, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving and productivity/development of quality products. We can see that many of these skills have already been covered in our tour of the research on game making as an educational activity. What we have left can be said to overlap with the concept of multiple literacies.

In terms of group communication and collaboration, while research has highlighted the potential of game making to encourage collaboration, there are comparatively few emprical studies available to support this claim Earp et al., 2013). .

We can see a direct link to studies surrounding game playing in the area of the value of linking activities to promote reflection.

Concepts of mulitliteracies wider definitions of digital literacies, and studies supporting this., and more specifically attempts to design learning environments which support this kind of approach.

The acquisition of these multiliteracies are often said to happen through engagement with additional activities around the game. Gee refers to this as metagaming, (where?)

This is a b

Discourses in this New Literacy context can comprise a wide variety of communication forms to include "the burgeoning variety of text forms associated with information and multimedia technologies" The New London Group, 1996, p. 61). In the context of computer games this is particularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements which may including online play or internet forums which contain conversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis, live chat possibilities and so on.

Kafai and Burke also look to embrace possibilities of online platforms through 'connected learning' 2015). They use a social lens highlight studies from Denner on pair programming as an effective social intervention in middle school Denner and Werner, 2007), and reference an study on peer interactions in game creation in Logo Ching and Kafai, 2008). The later study builds on previous analysis of the limits of teacher support in project based approaches, advocates more peer interaction as a tactical response, and develops a model to allow a richer description of helping activities.

It≈ç documents the value of the informal nature of digital explorations and identify play, and researches the resulting learning outcomes It≈ç, 2010). Diy media production and other meaning making in game playing communities are included in what been termed participatory culture Jenkins, 2009). Any studies?

A discussion of creative thinking skills developed through game making can be found in Robertson and Nicholson 2007).

Discussion  -----------

Some if not all of this topic suit introduction and some development in the introductory chapter.

Computational Thinking Widened as Power Grab

Widening definitions of computation thinking.

Resnick's work extends concepts, and then practices and perspectives.

Kafai, widens scope to include personal, social, cultural and tangible practices in a model which in cludes computational participation as a key skill, claiming that 'The framing of learning as personal, social, cultural and tangible is key in realizing that computational thinking needs to move beyond mere problem solving.' Y. Kafai and Burke, 2014, p. 3)

Could give overview of Resnick and Kafai on take on CT which is (based the tenents of constructionism) - Brennan and Resnick, 2012). espc

The reframing of various design and problems solving skills within a certain subject area, can be seen to be a political decision, however, there is evidence that this has not been successful in UK despite extensive rebranding and retraining focusing on the wider value of computational thinking.

Software, Affordances and Pedagogical Implications

This is present in the framing and explicit aims of some of the software tools which are brought into this domain. As an example we can look at an analysis of Games and Squire Games and Squire, 2008). ) They describe early efforts like the Boxer language and LOGO as situated as as a tangible environment to allow more concrete approach to programming but one which retains a need to teach fundamentals of programming before students can progress to adapting the tool to their own designs or games.

Scratch has an aim to lower barriers to entry much further via a visual approach to language construction and to extend possible project aims to maximise user engagement and accessibility .

In contrast other Games and Squire position a software tool like Gamestar Mechanic as more directly leveraging the pre=existing knowledge and motivation to create games which are presumed to be already part of the discourse of young people.

In many ways this returns to the debate of bricoleur vs abstract designer which was identified early in observations of the way learners learn to code Papert and Turkle, 1990).

Papert and microworlds, locating a genesis of situated thinking, constructionism, in comparison with piagets focus on decontextualised abstract knowledge, see Ackerman and other female authors in hard vs soft approaches

PERHAPS end of this return to the source and wrap things up here.

Lack of Studies that conform to certain standards

There is a clear lack of studies that conform to a rigour educational research approach as outlined by Cohen et al .

I would agree that more rigourous studies would be useful. At the same time, this lack could explained by several factors including; the rapidly moving characteristics of the toolsets which suits pilot studies, and the high level of expertise. enthusiasm and experience needed to balance the multiple competencies of programming concepts and game design patterns.

Part of this may be due to the challenge of context outlined in the next section and reluctance to devote the time needed to progress with a project based approach to curriculum knowledge acquisition which deepens understanding of context but at the expense of time covering other material.

Returning to the challenge context

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale for integration of playing complex games in schools Francis, 2006). Game making is time consuming. To convince educational managers of a broad potential , a common tactic of many studies to propose game making at a way to deepen subject knowledge. However, based on current research results this is problematic.

Kafai and Burke highlight that the conception of a mutually supportive, dual foci of coding abilities and content study was central to early conceptions of constructionist gaming Papert, 1980). However, while advocating such an approach, they do concede that it can be problematic in practice. Studies outline a key issue hindering content communication through game making activities is a tendency for the mechanics and processes of game creation to take a precedence over content exploration. Kafai et al., 1998; Ke, 2014) .

These difficulties of application are in part why this study focuses on the potential of a family learning environment to act as a more supportive and flexible space for such complex learning.

In focusing on the area of family learning it is not my intention to disregard the potential for game making in more formal environments. I do however wish to avoid an overly idealistic or realistic perspective on such potential which ignores the level of resources available to primary and secondary schools. I feel that such an approach a more responsible approach to that of some of the advocates of digital strategies which seems to be belittling to schools or professionals not integrating interactive, creative digital environments into their classrooms.

I will now examine key studies to bring out issues of scalability and suitability of classroom integration and to draw out particular contextual challenges. I also wish to highlight the potential for family learning environments to address some or all of these issues.
