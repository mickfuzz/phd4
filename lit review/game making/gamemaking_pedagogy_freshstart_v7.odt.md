This writing is a potential extract from my literature review, as such,some concepts that would have previously explored in literature aroundgame playing and Digital Game-Based Learning will have already beenexplored. I will make reference to those in this extract when there is across over between the pedagogy of game playing and game making. 

Game Making and Learning Outcomes ~~(rather than Pedagogy)~~============================================================

In this extract of writing I was supposed to give an overview of thegame making pedagogy grounded in the results of studies on game makingprogrammes.

ADD Summary of some of the design principles and pedagogical principlesat play

However, due to the complex environments of game making and the manypossible learning processes at play, it not a trivial matter categorisethem neatly via pedagogic approaches.\in this way.

Instead I will look at research categorised by underlying educationalmotivations for making games in a learning context, namely; the deeplearning of subject content, creative and design approaches(specifically to understand making games), learning computer coding,facilitating collaboration and communication, and finally game making asan accessible way to promote access to technology, particularly forgirls.

By including any one study in these categories I do not wish to implythat it applies to this area exclusively. Kafai and Burke eschew thesimplicity of a similar categorisation in a review by Hayes and Games,noting that there is a lot of crossover in any such divisionY.B. Kafai and Burke, 2014). While acknowledging this limit, I proposethat this approach has practical merits to examine the details ofresearch.

Games as a way to learn subject material across the curriculum--------------------------------------------------------------

In a seminal study which extended one of the original goals of LOGO, tocreate worlds where students could interact with math content in atangible wayPapert,1980a), Kafai used the process of constructing a game in the LOGOlanguage to encourage students at teach and fractionsKafai,1994),

Through detailed analysis of student learning logs, Kafai identies manywider learning outcomes but includes a deeper understanding of thesubject area.

To extend this personal study, Kafai highlights research to support theuse of computer game making as a tool to deepen subject knowledgeKafaiand Burke, 2015a).

The use of game design to support learning of non-computing curriculumsubjects also has precedent in the areas of maths , english languageskillsBurke,2012; Owston et al., 2009; Robertson and Good, 2005), nutritionBaytakand Land, 2010), scienceKangas,2010) and historySquireet al., 2005), .

Squire conducted 'longitudinal, 2-year design-based research studyinvestigating the potential of learning communities constructed aroundCiv3 to help disadvantaged students develop new identities as producersas well a consumers of historical simulation games.'Durgaand Squire, 2011)

The study of of the use of the game modification process made possiblein the game CivilisationSquire,2005) includes findings that indicate a more complex understanding ofmultiple factors at play in historical situations as an outcome ofplaying and most importantly re-designing the computer simulation.

Squire and colleagues also outlines the process of moving from player todesigner and describing the resultant shifts in persectiveSquireet al., 2005). This work is followed by later studies on emergentlearning communities discussion the modding CivilisationOwens,2011; Squire and Giovanetto, 2008), we can however question the timecommitment needed to apply this to wider educational use.

The limits of key studies in Kafai and Burke's review2015b)should be examined. Many often have extremely limited user base. This ismost notable in the case of a widely cited study by Baytak and Landwhich focused on only three participants2010).Other studies are only partial in the extent of testing subjectknowledge acquisition or deepening of knowledge. In particular, whilethe authours, as advocates for game making, include studies to supplyweight of argument of the use of games making to promote subjectknowledge, Many of the original authours are often cautious about thisand often highlight other other skill acquisition as a more primarylearning activityBaytakand Land, 2010; DiSalvo et al., 2014; Ke, 2014; Schanzer et al., n.d.).It is also striking that a study by Oswton which did quantify subjectbased skills in literacy had mixed results in this area while morepromising results in the area of digital literacyOwstonet al., 2009).

Kafai and Burke highlight that the conception of a mutually supportive,dual foci of coding abilities and content study was central to earlyconceptions of constructionist gamingPapert,1980b). However, while advocating such an approach, they do concede thatit can be problematic in practice. Studies outline a key issue hinderingcontent communication through game making activities is a tendency forthe mechanics and processes of game creation to take a precedence overcontent exploration.Kafaiet al., 1998; Ke, 2014), . Students get so wrapped up in the concretechallenge of making a game that deeping and researching the content isneglected. Kafai and Burke reminds us that this tendency is not limitedto student producers of games but also happens in the creation ofeducational games .

This picture matches one of the summary statements of a review byMoreno-Leon and Robles of studies looking beyond the study programmingin itselfusing the Scratch visual programming languageMoreno-Leónand Robles, 2016). Here the authors, see promise in studies thatintegrate programming activities into wider curriculum to supportsubject learning and which show evidence of the wider practicesincluding problems solving and creativity. For subject material theseinclude maths (), english language arts(),

However the authors are also clear that most studies in the area do notconform with certain aspirations in social science research as outlinedby Cohen and colleaguesCohenet al., 2011), specifically the group sizes are relatively small,studies often lack control groups and there are few pre and post tests .

Games as a way to learn programming-----------------------------------

A rich tradition of using games to learn programming has its origins inthe creation of the LOGO language and subsequent studies incorporatinggame making and digital art creationPapert,1980).

Papert's concept of using LOGO language to control Microworlds, digitalrealms with digital objects with physical characteristics to make moreconcrete the process of learning object oriented approaches to computercoding still inspires game making tool designers to this dayOvermars,2005; Resnick et al., 2009).

or a Resnick approach - Kafai -- study of game making in computer clubhouse

A study of game making in scratch showed more computational conceptsused than other media making activitiesAdamsand Webster, 2012).

Definitions of computational thinking or learning become moresophisticated but are starting to stabiliseGroverand Pea, 2013; Werner et al., 2014),

-   Abstractions and pattern generalizations (including models and    simulations)-   Systematic processing of information-   Symbol systems and representations-   Algorithmic notions of flow of control-   Structured problem decomposition (modularizing)-   Iterative, recursive, and parallel thinking-   Conditional logic-   Efficiency and performance constraints-   Debugging and systematic error detection

Many studies highlighting CT, now also highlight elements of systemsthinking, present in Grover and Pea's definition as patterngeneralisation (in next section).

As an example which starts to address assessment of CT, we can look to astudy by Werner and Denner . Here they attempt to quantify the levels ofcomputational thinking, they prioritise the use of design patterns andthen combination of those patterns into large game mechanicsWerneret al., 2014).

While ambitious and grounded in approach, it is hard to imagine how thisprocess could be automated, certainly, but also effectively donemanually, as it prescribes a particular approach which may not suit allcoders. (see Papert and Turkle)

This mirrors work done to automatically analyse scratch project toassess levels of Computational Thinking. Here by contracts analysis isof a framework of complexity chiefly of computer language syntax anddata types rather than game mechanic concepts of patternuseHooveret al., 2016)

Game making and accessibility-----------------------------

While this is a wide title, it encompasses studies addressing race andgender. This is a problematic area in terms of accessing data. In areview Kafai and Burke note only 50% of studies include such data .

-   Girls Coding GCG-- Denner -- Storytelling Alice-   Roberston 2012 -- Adventure author-   Rapunsel -- Flannagan -- via Hayes and Games-   Black students game making and testing -- Glitch project -- diSalvo

Wider issue of of access to computers from disadvantaged communities.

Possibility to shift attitudes using games, Kafai cites Repenning butdata seems missing to support motivational claims, mostly anecdotal ?Repenning,2013; Repenning et al., 2015).

Less so in other study, there is survey data here.Ryooet al., 2013). and evidence of increased of take up in programme, but nocontrol?

There seems more convincing data in the Reynolds/ Globaloria data.Reynoldsand Chiu, n.d.)

Games as a game design activity-------------------------------

A distinction between constructionist approaches to teaching programmingto open up future possibilities of design, to a more acceleratedadoption of game design discourse

What is design methodology and practice. We can link this to iterationand practice based approaches. Popular in the areas of the arts andespecially STUDIO based approaches (see below).

Linking to the professional habits of game design via Salen andZimmerman,

There have been explicit links made to design approach to as a processto support the learning Computation Thinking via the Use, Modify, CreateapproachAllanet al., n.d.).

Making this more educational via Torres, and then embodied in the GSMtool.

Systems thinking - link in game star mechanic, making as non-linearapproach. link to design / systems thinkingKynigos,2015).- and the teaching of not programming but the language of gamedesignSalen,2007). (check out the reading list here) -- Quest to Learn as example

For a more in depth of the assessment of computational thinking and thelink with systems thinking, seeWerneret al., 2014).

In this analysis we students advance in their stystems thinking throughtheir understanding beyond the structural elements of systems to includebehaviour and functionHmelo-Silverand Pfeffer, 2004). More advanced students use mental model as an aid tocreate complex, dynamic responses to ill-formed problems. Werner et allnote that in game making we can see a link to the pedagogic approach ofproblem-based learning.

And wider still design thinking in education and studio thinkingHetlandet al., 2013; Hokanson, 2013; Hokanson and Gibbons, 2014). This linkwith arts based practice is made inDenhamand Guyotte, 2018).

We can also for example Resnick's take on iterative spiral designprocess linked to a kindergarden processResnick,2007).

Compare this to Roberson's design processesRobertsonand Nicholson, 2007)

The complexity of activities carried out in games can be seen as acommunity ecosystem similar to that of a workplace.

Provoking collaboration, reflection, communication and other new literacies---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THERE IS A BRIDGE THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THE LAVE AND WEGNER --COP ABOVE IN GAME DESIGN AND SHAFFER'S EPISTEMIC GAMES AND GEE'SPROFESSIONAL DISCOURCES -- OR MOVE SOME OF THE BELOW ABOVE AND RECAP ININTRO HERE, AND MOVE QUICKLY ON TO SPECIFICS OF C21 SKILLS

This section is a bit of a catch all, for wider C21, skillsBerminghamet al., 2013)

In an analysis of wider frameworksVoogtand Roblin, 2012), twenty first century skills have been summarised ascollaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social/cultural skills &citizenship, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving andproductivity/development of quality products. We can see that many ofthese skills have already been covered in our tour of the research ongame making as an educational activity. What we have left can be said tooverlap with the concept of multiple literacies.

In terms of group communication and collaboration, while research hashighlighted the potential of game making to encourage collaboration,there are comparatively few emprical studies available to support thisclaimEarpet al., 2013). .

We can see a direct link to studies surrounding game playing in the areaof the value of linking activities to promote reflection.

Concepts of mulitliteracies wider definitions of digital literacies, andstudies supporting this., and more specifically attempts to designlearning environments which support this kind of approach.

The acquisition of these multiliteracies are often said to happenthrough engagement with additional activities around the game. Geerefers to this as metagaming, (where?)

This is a b

Discourses in this New Literacy context can comprise a wide variety ofcommunication forms to include "the burgeoning variety of text formsassociated with information and multimedia technologies"TheNew London Group, 1996, p. 61). In the context of computer games this isparticularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements whichmay including online play or internet forums which containconversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis,live chat possibilities and so on.

Kafai and Burke also look to embrace possibilities of online platformsthrough 'connected learning'Kafaiand Burke, 2015a). They use a social lens highlight studies from Denneron pair programming as an effective social intervention in middle schoolDennerand Werner, 2007), and reference an study on peer interactions in gamecreation in LogoChingand Kafai, 2008). The later study builds on previous analysis of thelimits of teacher support in project based approaches, advocates morepeer interaction as a tactical response, and develops a model to allow aricher description of helping activities.

Discussion-----------

Some if not all of this topic suit introduction and some development inthe introductory chapter.

Computational Thinking Widened as Power Grab

Widening definitions of computation thinking.

Resnick's work extends concepts, and then practices and perspectives.

Kafai, widens scope to include personal, social, cultural and tangiblepractices in a model which in cludes computational participation as akey skill, claiming that 'The framing of learning as personal, social,cultural and tangible is key in realizing that computational thinkingneeds to move beyond mere problem solving.'Y.Kafai and Burke, 2014, p. 3)

Could give overview of Resnick and Kafai on take on CT which is (basedthe tenents of constructionism) -Brennanand Resnick, 2012). espc

The reframing of various design and problems solving skills within acertain subject area, can be seen to be a political decision, however,there is evidence that this has not been successful in UK despiteextensive rebranding and retraining focusing on the wider value ofcomputational thinking.

Software, Affordances and Pedagogical Implications

This is present in the framing and explicit aims of some of the softwaretools which are brought into this domain. As an example we can look atan analysis of Games and SquireGamesand Squire, 2008). ) They describe early efforts like the Boxer languageand LOGO as situated as as a tangible environment to allow more concreteapproach to programming but one which retains a need to teachfundamentals of programming before students can progress to adapting thetool to their own designs or games.

Scratch has an aim to lower barriers to entry much further via a visualapproach to language construction and to extend possible project aims tomaximise user engagement and accessibility .

In contrast other Games and Squire position a software tool likeGamestar Mechanic as more directly leveraging the pre=existing knowledgeand motivation to create games which are presumed to be already part ofthe discourse of young people.

In many ways this returns to the debate of bricoleur vs abstractdesigner which was identified early in observations of the way learnerslearn to codePapertand Turkle, 1990).

Papert and microworlds, locating a genesis of situated thinking,constructionism, in comparison with piagets focus on decontextualisedabstract knowledge, see Ackerman and other female authors in hard vssoft approaches

PERHAPS end of this return to the source and wrap things up here.

Lack of Studies that conform to certain standards

There is a clear lack of studies that conform to a rigour educationalresearch approach as outlined by Cohen et al .

I would agree that more rigourous studies would be useful. At the sametime, this lack could explained by several factors including; therapidly moving characteristics of the toolsets which suits pilotstudies, and the high level of expertise. enthusiasm and experienceneeded to balance the multiple competencies of programming concepts andgame design patterns.

Part of this may be due to the challenge of context outlined in the nextsection and reluctance to devote the time needed to progress with aproject based approach to curriculum knowledge acquisition which deepensunderstanding of context but at the expense of time covering othermaterial.

Returning to the challenge context

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale forintegration of playing complex games in schoolsFrancis,2006).

These difficulties of application are in part why this study focuses onthe potential of a family learning environment to act as a moresupportive and flexible space for such complex learning.

In focusing on the area of family learning it is not my intention todisregard the potential for game making in more formal environments. Ido however wish to avoid an overly idealistic or realistic perspectiveon such potential which ignores the level of resources available toprimary and secondary schools. I feel that such an approach a moreresponsible approach to that of some of the advocates of digitalstrategies which seems to be belittling to schools or professionals notintegrating interactive, creative digital environments into theirclassrooms.

I return in this section to some of the previous studies to examine theissue of scalability and suitability of classroom integration to drawout particular contextual challenges.

I also wish to highlight the potential for family learning environmentsto address some or all of these issues.
