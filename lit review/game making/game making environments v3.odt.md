The characteristics and potential of selected digital game making environments==============================================================================

[]{#anchor}The starting point of this study is that making computergames has great potential supporting a diverse set of competenciesincluding computational practices, team work, problem solving andcritical thinking. There are exciting models of practice which have attheir core authentic links with real world issues, complex ecologies ofcooperation and accessible tool sets and practices. An open question toset the context could be: *What environments exist to facilitate thelearning the making of games in an authentic context which maximisesstudent control and engagement?*

This opening piece examines some of the overlapping concepts,environments and processes related to this area of interest rather thanspecifics of the tools involved. Due to a wide focus the aim is more acataloguing than in depth contrasting, however some attempts are made ingrouping and linking related concepts.

When discussing digital game making here, a wide definition is usedincluding, creating original games, video game level modding, sand-boxgames and hardware digital game hybridsGeeand Tran, 2016). Indeed, as Buckingham and Burn point out2007)the difference between making, playing and modding games is oftenblurred.

Constructionism and the legacy of LOGO--------------------------------------

Papert's interest in the educational value of the production of digitalartefacts as objects drove the creation of the LOGO coding language andassociated physical tools including drawing turtles. Many early studiesin the creation of digital games use LOGO as their base.

For this study Papert's concept of Microworld is of particularintersest. Microworlds are designed spaces which act as incubators forcertain kinds of learning. His criteria for microworld are that theyshould give examples of the chosen subject learning, bring all neededconcepts inside the microworld and that there are footholds for the enduser to put this kind of learning to use with interaction with the worldPapert,1980, p. 126).

It must comply to the what Papert sees as a common sense learningprinciple that to progress beyond making links to your existingknowledge you must use it, play with it to find out more and assimilateor accommodate your findings into your world viewAckermann,2001). Ackermann's exploration of the similarities betweenconstructionism and constructivism places Papert's focus on the waylearners identify and accommodate new information creating new internalrepresentations of the world. *There is a lot more to be written in thisarea but I want to move on to more concrete and contemporaryenvironments. *

Of particular interest to this study are the concept of soft and hardapproaches to codingPapert,1990). Whereas a hard approach infers a top down approach mirrored by acomputational thinking approachWing,2008), soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner directedconnection with the materials or digital artefacts involved, aconnection evoking Levi Strauss' concept of Bricolage1962).

A significant output of this lineage is the Scratch visual coding tooland community. The pedagogical underpinning of the Scratch project is areframing of the contructionist method in this context as softwaretinkeringMaloneyet al., 2010; Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013). Some of the key learningconcepts valued are; a playful and iterative approach, visual methodsusing code blocks, the ability to easily revise aims and a 'bottom-up'construction process where small clusters of code blocks are rapidlybuilt, tested and can then be combined in to larger code structures.Coding concepts are said to discovered through exploration.\

Resnick et al develop the process of designing a software tool tofacilitate such a constructivist approach into a framework with analogyto construction.2005).It should have wide walls catering for diverse interests, a lowthreshold to allow for novices with little experience and high ceilingsso learners are not restricted by the limits of the creative environmentas the progress. * *

*I would develop this more if there were a greater word count to discusstheir framework outlined below.\Immediate Feedback: See the result, see the process\Fluid Experimentation: Easy to get started, easy to connect,\Open Exploration: Variety of materials, variety of genres *

Resnick and Rosenbaum also discuss 'tinkering with tinkerability',namely facilitation guidelines to support the open learning processes.These include; set themes not challenges, highlight diverse examples,tinker with space, encouraging engagement with people, posing questionsinstead of giving answers and combining diving in with stepping back2013).They identify this as an area for further research.

Physical Tinkering and Making Environments------------------------------------------

The keyword tinkering has also gain traction amongst practitioners andresearcher in this domain of physical making. We can contrast the moreexperimental side of the maker movement with the more instructional kitassembly approaches. There are clear differences between the open-endedapproach to a pallette of objects which can be recombined flexibly frommade to the measure maker kits that come with a set of instructionswhich have become one output of the Maker movement. Such repetitivemaking based on preset instructions or temptation towards 'trivialfabrication' fails to exploit potential problem solving and designchallenges latent in the materialsBlikstein,2013; Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013).

Bevan et al propose another perspective which values the ability suchkits to build confidence and technical skills which serve to open furterpossibilities for a more playful and non-directed approach, suggesting astrategy of alternating between fabrication and tinkeringBevanet al., 2014).\

Let us examine detail an in-depth study by Bevan et al with a goal ofcreating a framework that can be used to evaluate learning throughtinkering activities in a museum settingBevanet al., 2015). The authors develop a set of learning dimensions createdin a previous study of after-school STEM activities described as ISE(informal science education)Petrichet al., 2013). Their framework for initial environmental design factorsis included at Table 1.

The framework can be seen to incorporate elements of Resnick andRosenbaum's tool focused design framework and extensions that in partanswer their call for more exploration of this area. The authors seetheir focus on the learning dimensions of the process as a valuableextension to the scope of the research in this area beyond maker spaceenvironment and the associated tool sets and activities. The research isbased on joint analysis of video recordings of a variety of tinkeringmuseum exhibits by researchers and domain practitioners. A briefcommentary follows on the four categories identified in the LearningDimensions framework.

*Engagement:* Beyond an observation of engagement via the duration andfrequency of engaging with activities researchers evaluated andimportance of affect though demonstrations of emotion in the process.The authors highlight that beyond engagement as being present orcompletion of tasks, the open ended nature of tinkering allows for moremoments of transition, of starting again, refocusing, scaling up ofambition of projects, which in turn allow for evidence of persistence,improvisation and identification with the process which give potentialto map a more nuanced analysis of engagement. *I would be interested tocross referencing this with other more evolved definitions of engagementin this and related areas*[]{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"qeFkH8wk","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Hidi and Renninger, 2006; Kearsley and Shneiderman, 1998; Whitton and Moseley, 2014)","plainCitation":"(Hidi and Renninger, 2006; Kearsley and Shneiderman, 1998; Whitton and Moseley, 2014)"},"citationItems":[{"id":3891,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/2RB2EG5Q"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/2RB2EG5Q"],"itemData":{"id":3891,"type":"article-journal","title":"The four-phase model of interest development","container-title":"Educational psychologist","page":"111–127","volume":"41","issue":"2","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Hidi","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Renninger","given":"K.

*Initiative and Intentionality: *The research team noted that whileintentionality was present in nearly all interactions of participantsthey could clarified intentionality further by relating it to theproblem space in focus at the time. Value was placed on persistence andon initiative which went beyond the an open-ended approach toself-assigning a problem which significantly increases the challenge athand and shows a form of 'intellectual courage' from Duckworth2006).

*Social Scaffolding:* The revision of this category to replacesolidarity in the previous framework places a greater emphasis on thedesign choices of facilitators to create an environment where supportiveinteractions take place. More specifically, the authors identify theorganisation of the space and materials in it to aid peer learning andencouragement through physical interaction with the work of others.

*Dimensions of Understanding: *This category in an evolution from theprevious of Innovation category reflecting the difficulty of measuringthe newness of knowledge or processes in museum visitors. Understandingis defined as broader fact recall but allows the inclusion of tinkeringactivities with concrete outcomes contrasted to piagetian concepts ofabstract and transferrable knowledgeAckermann,2001). Thus the research values an categorises evidence of visible orarticulated realisations of concepts, peer explanations, application oflearned and prior knowledge and the complexification of problems.

With the framework particular attention is placed on the idea ofovercoming problems and responding intuitively to new challenges,specifically the "improvisational" qualities of learning via tinkering.

Hackathons, Game Jams and accelerated production methods--------------------------------------------------------

Hackathon events are characterise by a time constrained and thusaccelerated production ethos. They have widened beyond code writingevents to embrace other creative and educational domainsJohnsonand Robinson, 2014; Kienzler and Fontanesi, 2017). A comparison to thegameful artificial constraints of hackathons compared to playful hackerspaces would be interesting to doRaison,2010).

Game Jams are an a type of hackathon where participants create gamesindividually or in teams in a time-constrained period, typically 24 or48 hours. Team events often take place in physical venues which may bepart of a wider global JamsAryaet al., 2013). Within Game Jams a breadth of materials are usedincluding video games, interactive fiction, and even a Cardboard JamEberhardt,2016). Eberhardt also identifies potentially incompatible strands ofGame Jams, specifically citing commercialised events and professionalGame Jammers contrasted to those Jams with a social purpose with a morediverse, less target driven audienceEberhardt,2016, p. 3).

Goddard et al have analysed the key aspects of Game Games includingtools, organisational processes and rewards systems2014),using a playful vs. gameful spectrum from Caillois2001).Design factors include; allowing teams to register before the event orenforcing a more playful team creation process, varied award categorieswhich encourage diverse outcomes rather than technically structuredawards and the culture of the Jam which may encourage risk taking andexperimental process over commercially viable products.

Beyond the scope of more competitive Game Jams a collective of New Yorkeducators have collaborated to create a process aimed at young peoplethat can be applied in a shorter time-frameGamesfor Change, 2017). Their process, the Moveable Game Jam, emphasiseslow-cost and both digital and analogue offline game production. Themotivation is to communicate fundamentals concepts of game designprocess to participants. These are broken down into; space, goal,components, mechanics and rules. The educational motivation is designand systems thinking for young people aligned with the Framework for21st Century LearningGilbert,2016).

The Moveable Game Jam can be situated on the playful side of thespectrum in that it uses loosely structured activities and broad goalsallowing for significant learner agency. Conversely, there are elementof a more structured approaches in the steering of game outputs towardsparticular social goals, periodic facilitator checking of thefundamental concepts previously mentioned and the use of extensive playtesting in the process.

Play testing is the process of involving other participants to try out aprototype of a game early the creation processEladhariand Ollila, 2012). It has a particular value in forcing an iterativeapproach and can be used to foster community feedback. The process ofbuilding in time-boxed goals like the creation of a game prototype for

Game Making and Project / Problem Based Learning------------------------------------------------

Game making can be seen as an example of the kind of *wicked problem*most favoured in project-based problem learning (referred to from now onas PBL)Mateasand Stern, 2005). PBL has a variety of forms, an exploration of which isbeyond the scope of this studyAditomoet al., 2013). The most pertinent areas of PBL of to this study are theover-arching focus on authentic learning environments and the process ofbuilding learner autonomy within a structured and supporting approach.

When learners undertake real life projects with relevance for or withdirect link to outside of the learning environment, there are strongparallels to the models of peripheral participation on communities ofpracticeWenger,1998). A collective game making process would do well to be aware offoster participation by highlighting paths into community participationto maximise sustainability. Fictional tasks and roles can also impactlearner engagementHeathcoteand Herbert, 1985).

The structuring of the learning involved in PBL is highlighted by thosewishing to defend it from dismissal as unsupported, pure discoverylearningHmelo-Silveret al., 2007; Kirschner et al., 2006). We can see parallels in PBLprogramme design to that tinkering tools and environments in thatdecisions are made to support specific areas of learner discovery deemedof particular value by carefully obscuring other potentially distractingaspects behind 'black box' processesResnickand Silverman, 2005).

Working with complex issues via Critical Making-----------------------------------------------

The final concept I want to dip into in this smörgåsbord of autonomouslearning processes is that of Critical MakingRatto,2011). In Ratto's description Critical Making he values criticalthinking as a possible outcome of the process of the social makingobjects. Thus widening the potential of 'objects to think' beyondscience and maths to encompass more civic concerns.

The author highlights a gulf between technical work and social work thatcritical making can bridge. More specifically, in the exploration ofsocietal issues effected by technology. He finds use in a distinctionbetween *caring about* an issue and a more informed *caring for* anissue informed by experience and a sense of responsibility. This stemsfrom the reframing of our reality as designed rather than discovered.Thus shifting matters of fact (which can't be changed) into matters ofconcern where the outcome is at playLatour,2008).

Ratto maps three, non-linear phases of Critical Making, exploration ofexisting areas (texts or ideas), making prototypes to reductively mapsuch ideas and finally reflection and exploration of ideas through therevision of prototypes. The author links the process to three keyelements of constructionism the possibility for emotional dimension oflearning, the importance of transitional objects (projecting your selfinto objects to think with) and the value of 'messing about' to avoidconstrictive working processesPapert,1988).

In the exploration of two case studies the author recommendsacknowledging the reductive nature of simplifying complex social issuesinto physical and digital models as a tool to help stimulate debate andinterest amongst participants.

 **Conclusion and areas for future development **------------------------------------------------

This writing has addressed certain pedagogical approaches and learningenvironments which may be of use in the creation of a digital gamemaking communities. During the course of this research other factorshave come to focus as having potential significance.

While this study too a wide definition of what it meant to make digitalgames, a more thorough investigation of the variety of methods ofcreation, modification and customisation of games. This area would suita concurrent examination of the possibilities and drawbacks of the gamemaking software or frameworks involved.

The low cost nature of developing in a browser and the alternative usesof the web technologies sued may address concerns of the cost of toolsand the time involved in learning game making environmentWhitton,2012).
