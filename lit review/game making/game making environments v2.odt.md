The characteristics and potential of selected digital game making environments==============================================================================

[]{#anchor}The starting point of this study is that making computergames has great potential supporting a diverse set of competenciesincluding computational practices, team work, problem solving andcritical thinking. There are exciting models of practice which have attheir core authentic links with real world issues, complex ecologies ofcooperation and accessible tool sets and practices. An open question toset the context could be: *What environments exist to facilitate thelearning the making of games in an authentic context which maximisesstudent control and engagement?*

This opening piece examines some of the overlapping concepts,environments and processes related to this area of interest rather thanspecifics of the tools involved. Due to a wide focus the aim is more acataloguing than in depth contrasting, however some attempts are made ingrouping and linking related concepts.

When discussing digital game making here, a wide definition is usedincluding, creating original games, video game level modding, sand-boxgames and hardware digital game hybridsGeeand Tran, 2016). Indeed, as Buckingham and Bum point out2007)the difference between making, playing and modding games is oftenblurred.

The Constructionist school and the legacy of LOGO-------------------------------------------------

Papert's interest in the educational value of the production of digitalartefacts as objects drove the creation of the LOGO coding language andassociated physical tools including drawing turtles. Many early studiesin the creation of digital games use LOGO as their base.

For this study Papert's concept of Microworld is of particularintersest. Microworlds are designed spaces which act as incubators forcertain kinds of learning. His criteria for microworld are that theyshould give examples of the chosen subject learning, bring all neededconcepts inside the microworld and that there are footholds for the enduser to put this kind of learning to use with interaction with the worldPapert,1980, p. 126).

It must comply to the what Papert sees as a common sense learningprinciple that to progress beyond making links to your existingknowledge you must use it, play with it to find out more and assimilateor accommodate your findings into your world viewAckermann,2001). Ackermann's exploration of the similarities betweenconstructionism and constructivism places Papert's focus on the waylearners identify and accommodate new information creating new internalrepresentations of the world. *There is a lot more to be written in thisarea but I want to move on to more concrete and contemporaryenvironments. *

A significant output of this lineage is the Scratch visual coding tooland community. The pedagogical underpinning of the Scratch project is areframing of the contructionist method in this context as softwaretinkeringMaloneyet al., 2010; Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013). Some of the key learningconcepts valued are; a playful and iterative approach, visual methodsusing code blocks, the ability to easily revise aims and a 'bottom-up'construction process where small clusters of code blocks are rapidlybuilt, tested and can then be combined in to larger code structures.Coding concepts are said to discovered through exploration.

The contrast of learning through exploration contrasted withinstruction\

Resnick et al develop the process of designing a software tool tofacilitate such a constructivist approach into a framework with analogyto construction.2005).It should have wide walls catering for diverse interests, a lowthreshold to allow for novices with little experience and high ceilingsso learners are not restricted by the limits of the creative environmentas the progress. * I would develop this more if there were a greaterword count. *

Resnick and Rosenbaum discuss tinkering with tinkerability as a way togive general guidelines to support the open learning processes theyvalue including: set themes not challenges, highlight diverse examples,tinker with space, encouraging engagement with people, posing questionsinstead of giving answers and combining diving in with stepping back2013).They identify this area of developing learning environments to suit atinkering approach as rich for further research.

Physical Tinkering and Making Environments------------------------------------------

The keyword tinkering has also gain traction amongst practitioners andresearcher in this domain of physical making. We can contrast the moreexperimental side of the maker movement with the more instructional kitassembly approaches.

Let us examine detail an in-depth study by Bevan et al with a goal ofcreating a framework that can be used to evaluate learning throughtinkering activities in a museum settingBevanet al., 2015). The authors develop a set of learning dimensions createdin a previous study of after-school STEM activities described as ISE(informal science education)Petrichet al., 2013). Their framework for initial environmental design factorsis included at Table 1.

The framework can be seen to incorporate elements of Resnick andRosenbaum's tool focused design framework and extensions that in partanswer their call for more exploration of this area. The authors seetheir focus on the learning dimensions of the process as a valuableextension to the scope of the research in this area beyond maker spaceenvironment and the associated tool sets and activities. A briefcommentary follows on the four categories identified in the LearningDimensions framework.

**Engagement:** Beyond an observation of engagement via the duration andfrequency of engaging with activities researchers evaluated andimportance of affect though demonstrations of emotion in the process. *Iwould be interested to cross referencing this with other more evolveddefinitions of engagement in this and related areas*[]{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"G6QBeHyw","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Kearsley and Shneiderman, 1998; Whitton and Moseley, 2014)","plainCitation":"(Kearsley and Shneiderman, 1998; Whitton and Moseley, 2014)"},"citationItems":[{"id":3889,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/D8RNV7TP"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/D8RNV7TP"],"itemData":{"id":3889,"type":"article-journal","title":"Engagement Theory: A Framework for Technology-Based Teaching and Learning.","container-title":"Educational TechnologyEducational Technology","page":"20-23","volume":"38","issue":"5","shortTitle":"Engagement Theory","author":[{"family":"Kearsley","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Shneiderman","given":"Ben"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]}},"label":"page"},{"id":1586,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/BW9JZKEC"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/BW9JZKEC"],"itemData":{"id":1586,"type":"article-journal","title":"Deconstructing Engagement Rethinking Involvement in Learning","container-title":"Simulation & Gaming","page":"433â€“449","volume":"45","issue":"4-5","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Whitton","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Moseley","given":"Alex"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]}},"label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDq3uH0TQTR3}*(Kearsleyand Shneiderman, 1998; Whitton and Moseley, 2014). *

**Initiative and Intentionality: **The research team noted that whileintentionality was present in nearly all interactions of participantsthey could clarified intentionality further by relating it to theproblem space in focus at the time. Value was placed on persistence andon initiative which went beyond the an open-ended approach toself-assigning a problem which significantly increases the challenge athand and shows a form of 'intellectual courage' from Duckworth2006).

![](./Pictures/1000020100000266000003285785C5DDF9794E78.png){width="16.245cm"height="21.378cm"}

**Social Scaffolding: ** The revision of this category to replacesolidarity in the previous framwork places a greater emphasis on thedesign choices of facilitators to create an environment where supportiveinteractions take place. More specifically, the organisation of thespace and materials in it aids the peer-assistive process. There arepotential links here to organising a coding club that has physicalartefacts or online processes which mirror this support. This reportuses the transcripts of interactions to make this link between designchoices and learning outcomes explicit and evidence based.

**Dimensions of Understanding:** This replaces the Innovation categoryas researchers felt that it was unrealistic to try to measure thenewness of knowledge or process in day visitors to the museum. Thiscategory of understanding is wider than standards focused fact recallbut still aims to justify tinkering as an activity with concreteoutcomes. Thus evidence of realisations, peer explanations, applicationon learned and prior knowledge, and the complexification of problems.There is a duplication of persistence here with intentionality whichvalues the idea of overcoming problems and responding intuitively to newchallenges. This is consistently valued in other parts of the textspecifically the "improvisational" qualities of learning via tinkering.

The original chapter that is the starting point for the framework isworth exploring in full. The broader focus of OSE may be more in keepingwith the focus of a study exploring media literacy / computationalthinking.

The authors point out that the focus here on learning outcomes/possibilities rather than setting and activities makes the study unusualcompared to other studies of tinkering.

In summary the authors highlight that beyond engagement as being presentor completion of tasks, the open ended nature of tinkering allows formore moments of transition, of starting again, refocusing, scaling up ofambition of projects, which in turn allow for evidence of persistence,improvisation and identification with the process which give potentialto map a more nuanced analysis of engagementWhittonand Moseley, 2014).

This focus on museum learning is illustrating in the reading list.

There are clear differences between the open-ended approach to apallette of objects which can be recombined flexibly from made to themeasure maker kits that come with a set of instructions which havebecome one output of the Maker movement. The rigorous reproduction ofthe picture on the box detract from the problem solving and designchallenges latent in the materials.

Many making advocates would perhaps discourage such a reverent approachto the goal of such kits and could comment that the original designexists only as a starting point to be torn apart on and rebuild incombination with similar materials. How much this actually happens maybe dependent on the culture in which kits are assembled.

Hackathons, Game Jams and accelerated production methods--------------------------------------------------------

Hackathon events are characterise by a time constrained and thusaccelerated production ethos. They have widened beyond code writingevents to embrace other creative and educational domainsJohnsonand Robinson, 2014; Kienzler and Fontanesi, 2017). Acceleratedproduction methods are being applied to a wide variety of domains.

Game Jams are an a type of hackathon where participants create gamesindividually or in teams in a time-constrained period, typically 24 or48 hours. Team events often take place in physical venues which may bepart of a wider global JamsAryaet al., 2013). Within Game Jams a breadth of materials are usedincluding video games, interactive fiction, and even a Cardboard JamEberhardt,2016). Eberhardt also identifies potentially incompatible strands ofGame Jams, specifically citing commercialised events and professionalGame Jammers contrasted to those Jams with a social purpose with a morediverse, less target driven audienceEberhardt,2016, p. 3).

Goddard et al have analysed the key aspects of Game Games includingtools, organisational processes and rewards systems2014),using a playful vs. gameful spectrum from Caillois2001).Design factors include; allowing teams to register before the event orenforcing a more playful team creation process, varied award categorieswhich encourage diverse outcomes rather than technically structuredawards and the culture of the Jam which may encourage risk taking andexperimental process over commercially viable products.

Beyond the scope of more competitive Game Jams a collective of New Yorkeducators have collaborated to create a process aimed at young peoplethat can be applied in a shorter time-frameGamesfor Change, 2017). Their process, the Moveable Game Jam, emphasiseslow-cost and both digital and analogue offline game production. Themotivation is to communicate fundamentals concepts of game designprocess to participants. These are broken down into; space, goal,components, mechanics and rules. The educational motivation is designand systems thinking for young people aligned with the Framework for21st Century LearningGilbert,2016).

The Moveable Game Jam can be situated on the playful side of thespectrum in that it uses loosely structured activities and broad goalsallowing for significant learner agency. Conversely, there are elementof a more structured approaches in the steering of game outputs towardsparticular social goals, periodic facilitator checking of thefundamental concepts previously mentioned and the use of extensive playtesting in the process.

Play testing is the process of involving other participants to try out aprototype of a game early the creation processEladhariand Ollila, 2012). It has a particular value in forcing an iterativeapproach.

Game Making and Project / Problem Based Learning------------------------------------------------

Game making can be seen as an example of the kind of *wicked problem*most favoured in project-based problem learning (referred to from now onas PBL)Mateasand Stern, 2005). PBL has a variety of forms, an exploration of which isbeyond the scope of this studyAditomoet al., 2013). The most pertinent areas of PBL of to this study are theover-arching focus on authentic learning environments and learner agencyin the processes as a means to provoke "deep" learning in students.

We can retrospectively start to analyse previous against these criteria?

Accelerated Creative Processes and Game Jams

Game Jams and Hackathons are a form of accelerated production processthat has simlararities to code sprints.

Stressing there is no right way to do a jam.

The process for creating teams is varied including the socialistprocess.

\**Conclusion and areas for future development **

This writing has addressed some of the key pedagogical approaches andlearning environments common in the teaching of web game making andcreating of game making communities. During the course of this researchother factors have come to focus as having potential significance.

While this study too a wide definition of what it meant to make digitalgames, a more thourough investigation of the variety of methods ofcreation, modification and customisation of games.

This area would suit a concurrent examination of the possibilities anddrawbacks of the game making software or frameworks involved.

The low cost nature of developing in a browser and the alternative usesof the web technologies sued may address concerns of the cost of toolsand the time involved in learning game making environmentWhitton,2012).

The research brought up memories for me of different tech environmentsthat I have been involved in where the way we arranged our processhelped draw people into our world. Specifically, playing withpreconceptions and creating unexpected working situations. A highlightwere rural media labs at protest camps where a disparate group ofvolunteers brought various hi-tech but low-cost equipment assembled in afraying army tent. As your eyes adjusted to the gloom upon entry, youwould be greated with the sight of leds, and strewn power and cat 5cables snaking back to a wind generator and satellite connection diskmounted on haybales at the back of the tent.
