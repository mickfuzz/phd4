The foc s of this st dy is on collaborative prod ction in family learning environments. I plan to approach it from constr ctivist, socioc lt ral perspectives. I am keen to involved, playf l  se of games and accessible constr ction materials to aid the creative process, lowering barriers to participation and help b ild confidence develop the identities of participant as makers and creators. The interaction between physical and digital aspects of the making processes is of great interest to me.


## []{#anchor} amily Learning Provision

The term family learning is problematic in that it can encompass all learning happening in a home learning environment or on visits o tside the home with family members or may refer to more formal provision. In this section I will  se the term  L to indicate more formal provision.

Q est to Learn, an innovative school for grades 6 to 1  in New York City, grew o t of the idea that gaming and game design offer a promising new paradigm for c rric l m and learning. The designers of Q est to Learn developed an approach to learning that draws from what games do best: drop kids into inq iry-based, complex problem spaces that are b ilt to help players  nderstand how they are doing, what they need to work on, and where to go next. Content is not treated as dry information b t as a living reso rce; st dents are enco raged to interact with the larger world in ways that feel relevant, exciting, and empowering. Q est to Learn opened in the fall of    9 with 76 sixth graders. In their first semester, these st dents learned―among other things―to convert fractions into decimals in order to break a piece of code fo nd in a library book; to  se atlases and read maps to create a location g ide for a reality television series; and to create video t torials for a hapless gro p of fictional inventors. This research and development doc ment o tlines the learning framework for the school, making the original design available to others in the field. Elements in development incl de a detailed c rric l m map, a b dget, and samples of st dent and teacher handbooks.","event-place":"Cambridge, Mass","ISBN":"978- - 6 -51565-8","lang age":"English","n mber-of-pages":"164","p blisher":"The MIT Press","p blisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass","so rce":" mazon","title":"Q est to Learn: Developing the School for Digital Kids","title-short":"Q est to Learn","a thor":[{"family":"Tekinbaş","given":"Katie Salen"},{"family":"Torres","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Wolozin","given":"Loretta"},{"family":"R fo-Tepper","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Shapiro","given":" rana"}],"iss ed":{"date-parts":[["  1 ",1 , 9]]}},"prefix":"","s ffix":""}],"schema":"https://gith b.com/citation-style-lang age/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDEkED E43Oe}(Tekinbaş et al.,   1 ).
