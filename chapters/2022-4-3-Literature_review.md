title: Literature Review
---

The aims of this literature review:

- introduce concepts that may also inform conceptual framework / methodology
- outline existing game making pedagogies
- focus in on cultural / social elements of particular promising pedagogies.  

<!-- I've done previous planning here.
chapters/planning/lit review/meta notes on planning lit rev/My thoughts on lit review_.docx.md

<!--
## Research Questions
- What game making pedagogies exist?
- How can you apply Project Based Learning principles (and inclusive teaching methods) to a game making / creative coding?
- How do game patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?
- What effect does a pedagogical model focused on PBL principles (especially learner choice) have on parent and child learner experiences of digital game making ?
-->


## Community Approach to Game making

Foundation sociocultural approach which goes beyond a conception of transmission model of learning and embraces learning in context.

- Vygotsky (and friends) - foundational ideas - activity as unit of analysis
- Wertsch and Cole - community and context as vital in studies, role of cultural mediation in development @cole_beyond_1996-1 .
- Rogoff - community of learners and 3 foci as a way to frame this in education

<!--
// don't focus in on DBR save that... -->

### Activity as Unit of Analysis

Quickly rephrase from a Rogoff chapter. Keep it snappy.

### Cultural Mediation

The vital role of cultural mediation in development @cole_beyond_1996-1

This clearly aligns with digital making. Find citation.


### Application to Community Learning
Keywords - Communities of Practice, Situated learning & legitimate peripheral participation.

### Guided participation Rogoff and Communities of Learners

(Continue to) refute or problematise  dichotomy of learner led, teacher led approaches @mascolo_beyond_2009.

Participation on community activities as a valid approach.

Cultural and social factors are vital to development process even if hidden in as school setting.
Guided participation as a middle ground between instruction and discovery.

Teachers benefit from the concept of scaffolding, and designing learning environments and interventions to support learners to enter into a pattern of activity.

This has been applied in various forms, PBL, apprenticeship models, for example have guided participation as a base via different forms of scaffolding. 

<!-- Perhaps don't get into 3 planes yet save that for more detailed analysis -->

## Summary of Digital Making Studies from a Sociocultural Perspective

As such, to help answer RQ1 & 2, this literature review now turns to explore game making and digital making studies which explore social and community planes either explicitly or implicitly.

The focus on historical and cultural artefacts and practices brought by Rogoff, and in particular the concept of guided participation was originated in non-school settings and younger age ranges.  

However, the concept has been used to analyse participation in non-formal and formal settings.
The following studies are relevant:

- guided participation framed in media literacy @aarsand_appropriation_2016.
-

### Formal, non-formal and informal.

This distinction is not just about a school or non-school environment @erstad_identity_2012.

While some researchers define formal learning as that which happens in school and informal learning as that outside of school (Gerber et al., 2001), others (Eshach, 2007, p. 173; Werquin, 2009) would describe an intervention like the one in this study -- where learning happens outside of formal institution and where there is little instruction but the learner experience is carefully planned -- using the term 'non-formal' in contrast to both formal and unstructured/informal learning. Sefton-Green (2004) complicates this view, noting that informal learning can take place in formal settings and vice-versa. Given this inconsistency, my study will use research and relevant literature to create working definitions of such terms. Research exploring home game playing and digital activity uncovers material that families may bring into a non-formal game making process; I will draw on work on participatory culture (Jenkins, 2009), affinity spaces (Gee, 2004a) and naturalistic studies of digital use and creativity in the home (It≈ç et al., 2010; Livingstone et al., 2018). Gee's (2004b) work on games and associated culture as learning experiences is founded on his understanding of how they engender a shared discourse and emerging identities . My study will be guided by understandings of how home discourses or 'funds of knowledge' (Moje et al., 2004; Moll et al., 1992, p. 3) can be drawn on as a resource by participants to facilitate learning in new environments.


### Family Making
Roque's work is founded on sociocultural / situated understandings of learning and brings it into a non-formal learning environment. A key question she asks is how can facilitators help develop participation in community activities [@roqueBecomingFacilitatorsCreative2018].
I extend this in this study, how can the learning design contribute?

## On Game Making pedagogies

There is a lot of similarity of game making pedagogies and that of digital making and broader study of media literacy. This section attempts to stay focused on game making where possible but widens domain if relevant to the questions of community approaches.

- UMC / Remixing  - Half-baked games
- Design approaches - designing for an audience
- Broader definition of CT, computational fluency / computational participation.
- Physical methods, feedback, from constructionism
- Design patterns in Agent sheets
- Game jam, space, mechanics, rules, etc .
