## Research Questions

- What game making pedagogies exist?
- How can you apply Project Based Learning principles (and inclusive teaching methods) to a game making / creative coding?
- How do game patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?
- What effect does a pedagogical model focused on PBL principles (especially learner choice) have on parent and child learner experiences of digital game making ?

## Game Making pedagogies

- UMC / Remixing  - Half-baked games
- Design approaches - designing for an audience
- Broader definition of CT, computational fluency / computational participation.
- Physical methods, feedback, from constructionism
- Design patterns in Agent sheets
- Game jam, space, mechanics, rules, etc .

## Project-based learning / Social approach / Communities of Learners.

- Key features of PBL - from academic sources up to date.
- Benefits of PBL, autonomy / agency /
- Creating a community of learners
- Examples of how this has been applied in game making or creative coding case studies. (RQ2)
