title: Literature Review
---

The aims of this literature review:

- introduce concepts that may also inform conceptual framework / methodology
- outline existing game making pedagogies
- focus in on cultural / social elements of particular promising pedagogies.  

<!--
## Research Questions
- What game making pedagogies exist?
- How can you apply Project Based Learning principles (and inclusive teaching methods) to a game making / creative coding?
- How do game patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?
- What effect does a pedagogical model focused on PBL principles (especially learner choice) have on parent and child learner experiences of digital game making ? -->


## Community Approach to Game making

Foundation sociocultural approach which goes beyond a conception of transmission model of learning and embraces learning in context.

- Vygotsky (and friends) - foundational ideas - activity as unit of analysis
- Wertsch and Cole - community and context as vital in studies, role of cultural mediation in development @cole_beyond_1996-1 .
- Rogoff - community of learners and 3 foci as a way to frame this in education

<!--
// don't focus in on DBR save that... -->

### Activity as Unit of Analysis

Quickly rephrase from a Rogoff chapter. Keep it snappy.

### Cultural Mediation

The vital role of cultural mediation in development @cole_beyond_1996-1

This clearly aligns with digital making. Find citation.

### Guided participation Rogoff -and Communities of Learners

(Continue to) refute or problematise  dichotomy of learner led, teacher led approaches @mascolo_beyond_2009.

Participation on community activities as a valid approach.

Cultural and social factors are vital to development process even if hidden in as school setting.

Guided participation as a middle ground between instruction and discovery.

Wider application, PBL for example has this as a base.

<!-- Perhaps don't get into 3 planes yet save that for more detailed analysis -->

## Summary of Digital Making Studies from a Sociocultural Perspective

As such, to help answer RQ1 & 2, this literature review now turns to explore game making and digital making studies which explore social and community planes either explicitly or implicitly.

### Family Making
Roque's work is founded on sociocultural / situated understandings of learning and brings it into a non-formal learning environment. A key question she asks is how can facilitators help develop participation in community activities [@roqueBecomingFacilitatorsCreative2018].
I extend this in this study, how can the learning design contribute?


## A list of Game Making pedagogies

- UMC / Remixing  - Half-baked games
- Design approaches - designing for an audience
- Broader definition of CT, computational fluency / computational participation.
- Physical methods, feedback, from constructionism
- Design patterns in Agent sheets
- Game jam, space, mechanics, rules, etc .

<!-- ## Project-based learning / Social approach / Communities of Learners.

- Key features of PBL - from academic sources up to date.
- Benefits of PBL, autonomy / agency /
- Creating a community of learners
- Examples of how this has been applied in game making or creative coding case studies. (RQ2) -->
