## Overview of structure

### Theoretical Framework
- Intro to social turn, school,
- Design-based research
- intervention studies within educational field

<!-- - AT -->
  <!-- - what is AT in brief
  - why AT for this Study
  - what flavour of AT and why
  - finding the unit of analysis -->

### Methodology

- Data analysis methods and justification

### What research questions are answered by what data gathering and analysis?

<!-- See the thesis by Digital Game Education: Designing interventions to encourage playersâ€™ informed reflections on their digital gaming practices Rafael Marques de Albuquerque

As this is done very methodically
-->



### Stages of Design

#### Evolution of Template and supporting resources
I'm not sure if this even goes into this chapter - it certainly starts to answer some of the research questions.

Go into more detail than previously on the choice and use of tools.

Use the 3M framework as a guide for MakeCode
Revisit FM book as a guide for Glitch/ Phaser



### Issues Emerging from Evolution of Design

More detailed analysis - thoughts on validity of data
