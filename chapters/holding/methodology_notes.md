## Introduction to social turn, context and interventions

As explored in the intro and lit review there are particular limitations in the kind of empirical research that characterises many studies involving game making. Many of these limitations involve research in to background cultures of participants and how they can be involved into making activities and a focus on creating and sustaining an authentic learning environment.

This focus on the environment and context is in line with social and cultural lines of research. Socio-cultural research and perspectives can be broadly described as...

For the focus of this study on developing game coding abilities particular aspects of importance are of understanding of the importance of context, and the ongoing development of cultural artefacts

As we have seen in the literature review on game making, context plays out in the way

Barab and Squire [@barab_design-based_2004]



The focus of this study is on the construction of shared meaning and practices as part of an emerging community of game makers. To do this I adopt a sociocultural approach and specifically design-based research. This section explores complementary methodologies of value before outlining key characteristics of design-based research which make it an attractive candidate for this study.

## Why a social focus rather than Piaget's constructivism


Cobb -@cobb_where_1994 identifies two broad schools of constructivism, one focusing more on individual cognitive processes which follows the work of Piaget and the other drawing on the academic lineage of Vygotsky which locates knowledge formation as a cultural activity. Much of the foundational literature on game making focuses on personal dimensions of learning (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996). They draw on Papert's constructionist approach which extends a piagetian take to propose that construction of personal knowledge happens best where learners can experiment and manipulate objects Ackermann, 2001). Such a focus on individual learning is problematic from perspective of sociocultural approaches due to a tendency to ignore both contextual factors influencing the learning setting and the evolving use of resources, processes and shared understandings by emergent communities of learners O'loughlin, 1992). Some of the specifics of these processes have already been named in the section above looking at collaboration. Other concepts of value include Vygotsky's concept of mediated action Wertsch, 1994); Rogoff's take on guided participation within a community of learners Rogoff, 1993); and more detailed analysis of roles community-based transfer of knowledge in practice Lave and Wenger, 1991).

While noting the limits of an individualist approach of many studies from constructionist researchers, it is important not to dismiss the value of this lineage of studies. Notably, later work from Kafai incorporates broader social approaches and attempts to bring them into the constructionist fold Kafai and Burke, 2015). Kafai and Burke draw on the conceptions of Rogoff 1993) of personal, social and community learning planes to advocate the wide-ranging benefits of 'constructionist gaming'. However for this study constructionism seems of best value in providing design guidelines but much weaker as either an underlying theoretical or analytical framework.

As my study seeks to address cultural factors which act as barriers to participation in digital making, it requires a method of research which allows the detailed description and evaluation of complex, emergent learning environments. While other suitable methodological approaches exist including participatory design Muller, 2007), ethnography and guided participation, Rogoff et al., 1993), communities of practice Lave and Wenger, 1991), Activity Theory
, I have chosen




## Design Base Research -

My own research in game making is an experimental approach to create a new learning design. I have worked with young learners, local families and undergraduate student helpers to evolve a game making design. A key driver of my research was to explore the potential to draw on family experience in learning activities by working with families to make games together. I propose that this environment is a fertile research base to jointly create learning activities with a wider potential application. To facilitate this goal I have taken a design-based approach which acknowledges the importance of context in educational research [@brown_design_1992]. Design based research is a varied discipline which can take a multitude of forms [@mckenney_educational_2021]. The core elements include: research as an intervention, iteration, involvement of participants in the evolution of designs, and a flexibility of research outcome based on how events unfold [@easterday_design-based_2014]. One of the key motivations of this approach is to produce educational research that has a high utility for practitioners through developing theory that is rooted in contextual practice and which can produce new pedagogies and resources [@cobb_design_2003-2].  

Barab and Squire [-@barab_design-based_2004] describe the messiness of design-based research and that this creates a challenge to the researcher of how to present results in a coherent way which is of use to other practitioners. There is a tension between sticking closely to the context of the research and the concrete specifics or stepping back to generalise and being lost in abstraction. Here, I try to strike a balance which stays concrete but which also pulls from my observations a framework which may translate in to other game-making and creative project based approaches.

Another guiding principle of design-based research - which is present in the techniques of design experiments, mutual appropriation and participatory action research - is that research participants also influence the ongoing design of the research [@barab_critical_2004; @cobb_design_2003; @downing-wilson_design_2011]. The design of the research experiment and learning I started from a very open position and has evolved from several iterations of collaborative work with participants. One experimental team consisted of Home Educating families another involved local primary schools with Year 6 (10-11 year old) classes. Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly. Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.


## Data Gathering and Analysis

My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer (facilitator and designer), participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. Specifically I will study in detail the use of the online help tutorials and example code snippets I have created and the code and other media content that participants create in their resulting video games. I also include other methods which suit the deeper analysis of participant actions to help construct models of activity systems, namely the videoing of the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants.

One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour. Large amounts of video data are being gathered, up to 20 hours of footage for each 2 hour session. I am developing a process of identifying appropriate episodes for closer analysis. I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies Derry et al., 2010). I will use a variant of discourse analysis to explore interactions of participants captured on video recordings. Mercer and colleagues identify discourse analysis as a loose associations of methods to support linguistic analysis of interactions to identify emergent patterns Mercer et al., 2004). While a common pattern in classroom interactions is that of IRF, initiation (teacher), response (student) and follow up (teacher) Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975), the inherent assumption that a teacher will be leading an activity will not consistently be appropriate for my study; although at times a parent may take this role. Other discourse analysis frameworks that take a sociocultural approach Lyle, 1993; Phillips, 1985), and specifically those from project focused studies Hmelo-Silver and Barrows, 2008; Moje et al., 2001), may be of greater use to allow more detailed treatment of the incorporation of tools and cultural artefacts into a collective discourse. To avoid distraction from AT as my principle analytical framework I am in agreement with Wells 1999, p. 172) who proposes the use of AT's concepts to situate 'spoken discourse \... as one, but only one, of the semiotic tools that participants use to achieve the goals of action'. Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals.

Turning attention to the gathering and analysis of other data, such a rich set of data, will allow the cross referencing of the many sources. My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music. To be able to effectively analyse these diverse sources, I will need to prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes. I explore some of the emerging themes and criteria for selection which incidents to explore in depth in the results section below. Again while diversity of data invites drawing on diverse methods of analysis, AT will provide a foundation for the analysis of these diverse data.

## Summary of Development of Programme

NOTE TO EDIT LATER -- before embarking on phases

I have carried out six phases of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline the core activities that have taken place including only the most basic detail on tools used. In following sections, the development of toolsets are analysed in greater depth. The core of the game making programme, which emerged in the first phase and has remained, is a starting template of a simple platform game which participants alter to make their own. The evolution of different versions and locations of this starting template has proven to be a key marker of the progress of the programme. The timeline of phases of activities is outlined in the following table.

\ In early stages of delivery I adopted an open project based approach. I will later describe how this evolved in to a template game using a javascript game making library and an online tool used for phases 1-4 which participants were invited to add to and alter.

Diversity in Participant Motivations

This representation of different sized systems as units of analysis allows for comparison of the different activity outcomes. At times the motivations may be shared between participants, at times in conflict. Interviews with participants showed overlaps and divergence between young people's motivations (to have fun, work with others together, 'learn how to make hard games,' create art), those of parents (create opportunities to learn coding and gain digital skills, 'understand my child's world of games', build collaboration and teamwork skills) and those of the facilitators (create opportunities for collaborative problem solving and media creation between participants, build meta-cognition of participants and roles as peer supporters). My role as facilitator was in part to try to resolve issues including conflicts in motivations, tensions in achieving goals, creating learning conditions which suited the operationalising of processing involved in coding processes Leont'ev, 1978).

This diversity of motivations created numerous tensions related to cultural expectations and experience of participants and wider communities.

These include:

-   Tensions relating to group work: My initial design asked team groups consisting of three families each to design games from scratch. Working as a large group was problematic - younger participants to focus on making pixel art game elements while parents felt a responsibility to drive coding work separately, those coordinating group work found this stressful. \[removed \]
-   Tensions from family culture clashes: While some dyads found parental involvement helpful for motivation some young people which at times seek to exclude parents from involvement in their game making favouring peer interaction at times and whilst returning for parental approval at others.
-   Diversity around family attitudes to game making: These tensions came became clear in informal chats with parents, post-session interviews and parent child dialogue. Some parents were hostile to computer games, others neutral but felt excluded from child's use, some more open but keen to direct children to making games to deepen learning.
-   Context of home education styles: Home education is traditionally more exploratory and project based rather than curriculum driven.
-   Attitudes to technology: Cultural resistance to computer coding or technical use of computers beyond browsing Wong, 2016) was particularly visible in parents but also present in some children.
-   Tension related to wider computing context: A goal of this programme is in part to support the wider needs of computing teaching and to research innovative practices within curriculum constraints . At times, in this informal family environment media literacy and digital fluency emerged as a focus much more than computational thinking, game design or coding competency. My desire to pull learning dimensions back towards more formal parameters to widen the potential scope of research should be acknowledged.


While these contextual tensions are a useful backdrop for the observations of this chapter, details of more specific attempts to resolve blocks, especially those relating to use of help documentation and community building processes are detailed in later sections. The diversity of actions involved in wider activity complicated my own conceptual navigation about the an overarching way of conceiving what learners would gain from the program and how I could best support that. This search for a unifying concept is explored in the next section on the germ cell of the activity.

### Germ Cell concept and Learning Dimensions

One key concept in AT is the identification of a Germ Cell of knowledge which Engestrom develops from Davydov in the tradition of Marxist thoughts of rising to the concrete. From Blunden Blunden, 2014) "when Activity Theorists identify a relation or action or concept or artefact as the 'germ cell' of a complex process, they mean that the relation is the simplest possible relation which will over time develop into the more complex process."

### Tensions related to concrete and abstract Learning Dimensions

The focus on the tension between concrete and abstract is a foundational concept explored by pioneers of creative computing in a seminal paper *Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete* Papert and Turkle, 1990). In this article the hands-ons, trail and error nature of novice computer programmers working in learning environments which give immediate feedback based on their coding efforts are championed. The privileging of abstract thought processes is challenged as a product of cultural bias of a wider scientific and academic community. A response to this bias is Papert's reluctance to codify the possible learning goals of a creative coding programme into a curriculum 2000). The findings of Papert's research are often structured around case studies that draw out understandings of processes of the participants interaction with the concrete. This approach is echoed by many constructionist researchers identifying as who, in line with Papert's thinking, have produced prolific publications of findings in case study format *Constructionism in Practice*, 1996; Logo Computer Systems Inc, 1999; Papert, 1980; Peppler et al., 2009).

I propose that there a tension between the need for an informal learning environment the contructionist approach requires (with the associated reluctance to codify learning outcomes) and a convention of more formal learning programmes to have documented learning requirements in the form of curriculum knowledge. Into to this vacuum comes Wing's 2006) influential article on Computational Thinking. While this framework helps justify computing activities in education and is formational in their inclusion in curriculum of some countries, it can be seen a swing back towards the abstract in this context.

I explore this tension in detail as I feel that there is the potential for it to be resolved to a great extent through frameworks of more concrete possible learning outcomes to aid the facilitator and facilitate participant's self-reflection on progress. The publication of Resnick and Brennan's 2012) framework detailing their more concrete interpretation of Computational Thinking can be seen as response to the rising popularity of Wing's more abstract interpretation of CT as a set of pedagogical concepts. This sentiment is more explicitly expressed by Petrich and colleagues in the study 'It looks like fun but are they learning' 2013), which addresses concerns expressed about making the value of tinkering exercises in science museum clear to a wider audience through a grounded and systematic mapping of knowledge and skills being practiced.

### Germ Cell -- an attempted resolution of this tensions between abstract and concrete for facilitators -- VIA GAME DESIGN PATTERNS

A possible emerging concept which may at act as a germ cell is use of game patterns as a source of actions which can expand both to become more concrete in application, and more abstract in conception after then have been enacted. To clarify this statement we can explore a a tangible example. Game patterns are often intuitively understood patterns of systemic behaviour which are brought by both younger and older family members as extremely funds of knowledge. The germ idea is that these starting points can be both:

1.  investigated as more specific, detailed completion of the idea in code form through engaging with the line by line, character by character with what Resnick and Brennan call Computational Concepts 2012)
2.  conceived of in a more abstract way as computational design patterns that are applied in different games, and wider even in generalised computing contexts like Human Computer Interaction (HCI)

An example from the game template that I created would be the process of creating an abstract representation of a game background and elements which is then translated by code allowing different outputs, a process clearly linked to the the builder design pattern da Cruz Silva et al., 2019). This process is replicated both in my original Phaser game template and in the MakeCode system using a tilemap system. Tilemaps have become a common way to save resources and accelerate layout design in modern game making MDN Web Docs, n.d.).

Design Patterns and Computational Patterns

The concept of computational design patterns is well explored in the professional literature of computer programming and design Gamma et al., 1995), and has also been adopted by game designers Bjork and Holopainen, 2005). Design patterns are well thought out solutions to common issues faced by computer programmers and system designers. Research in this area points to challenges of teaching the abstract nature of traditionally shared design patterns related to object oriented coding languages but points to visual methods and games as promising tactics Azimullah et al., 2020; da Cruz Silva et al., 2019) .

My own findings are inspired by the work of Repenning and Basawapatna 2010) on computational thinking patterns (CTPs) as part of their Scalable Game Design (SGD) programme. We can compare CTPs with design patterns. The kind of CTPs identified in this study are less abstract than the object-oriented design patterns offered by Gamma and colleagues 1995); however a similar guiding principle exists. Both concepts of patterns can be identified by participants through their familiarity with software as users. Patterns are also shared within communities of established and novice designers as a way of saving time, encouraging code reuse and developing a shared vocabulary of concepts that enriches computational practice of the community participants.

It is the familiarity and understandability which which drew the SCG researchers towards a pattern-based approach. They cite the contested nature of computational thinking National Academy of Sciences on Computational Thinking, 2010), and highlight the utility in more specific learning outcomes compared to more abstract interpretations of computational thinking. Their solution driven by their interactions with teachers is to foreground concepts that have potential to transfer to the area of science simulations Basawapatna et al., 2011). It it valuable to examine the specifics of the Computational Thinking Patterns (CPTs) in relation to the context, aims and tools of the Scalable Game Design programme. Example patterns are shown in the following diagram which is part of the assessment of individuals taking part in the programme.

![\ Illustration 6: Examples of Computational Thinking Patterns from SGD programme](./Pictures/10000000000002AD000002581577508549E2425F.png){width="12.349cm" height="10.816cm"}

The authors give examples such as *generation* and *absorbtion* in predator / prey relationships, *transportation *of oxygen by red blood cells and mosquitoes *hill climbing* (seeking the highest value) of human scent. The focus on transfer to science simulations concepts explains the increased distancing of language from both the mechanics of computational concepts (e.g. loops, lists, logic and variables) and those of game design pattern as explored in game design literature Bjork and Holopainen, 2005; Schell, 2008).

Selecting and organising Game Patterns to support emerging Learning Design

My end design highlights game patterns as a starting point for user interest and to draw participants in to other elements of learning dimensions. While my emergent model is similar in the progression of specific and relatable game patterns into a wider perspective more generalisable and transferable conceptions of computational patterns, it also encourages a narrower focus on the specific computational concepts as outlined by Resnick and Brennan 2012).

The process of amassing a list of different game patterns to add to a starting platformer template was an organic process of gathering the ideas of participants and the end of early sessions. Each week I would return with ad-hoc help documents and in person help. On completion of those patterns new ones would be selected and the process would start again.

My observations and interactions with participants often focused on the immediate mechanics of how to make the pattern they had selected work for them. In these sessions I was often extremely busy helping them problems solve of a line by line code level. In later sessions, I was able to help the participants make connections to times when they had met similar coding problems and remind them of how they had been solved previously.

In short I propose that here are design and teaching techniques that can link the learner-led game patterns and ideas with bother the wider and narrower patterns. Game patterns that act as a middle layer between the computational concepts the nuts and bolts, and the wider more abstract area of design patterns and computational thinking.

Along with the more process orientated concrete that are linked to the design process (explored in more detail later in this writing), these learning dimensions for the core of the framework that evolved to help facilitators and participants to track the learning happening during this kind of game making. The framework is included in the appendix but a summary table follows.

  ----------------- ------------------------------- --------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------   Coding Concepts   Wider Patterns      Design Practices          21st Century Skills   Sequences     Change Listener         Goal Setting              Developing Shared Practices and Vocabulary   Variables     Input Event             Being incremental and iterative   Joint Problem Solving and Development of Understanding   Loops         Separate Formatting from Data   Debugging             Non-Technical Project Support   Lists         Creating Functions          Self-Testing and Playtesting  Digital Literacy: Navigating Windows, Tabs and Internet Sites   Events        Systems Elements        Reusing and Remixing          Digital Literacy: Version Control   Logic         Systems Dynamics        Collaborative Production                   Balancing Feedback Loops    Publishing and Evaluating                  Reinforcing Feedback Loops                           ----------------- ------------------------------- --------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------

The wider patterns fall into two categories, computational patterns, (linked to common practices in HCI) and systems concepts. The process of identifying these CTP and systems thinking elements was in someways surprising as I had begun the process with a focus on collaborative and communicative skills based on reviews which highlighted lack of studies in this area.

This writing compared to early explorations de-prioritises to some extent the cataloguing of the potential for wider social skill acquisition -- e.g. 21^st^ Century Skills - afforded by the learning design, to focus on what is unique about the object of game making compared to similar creative making programmes. However, while these social elements have not the focus of many of the emerging observations of this chapter, they are without doubt present in all of the data I am collecting and will be explored in later writing.

Rising to the Concrete

The literature in the school of Activity Theory describes a process of *rising to the concrete *[]{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"Twipc7ls","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Cole et al., 2014)","plainCitation":"(Cole et al., 2014)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":25,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/3AZH8GGH"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/3AZH8GGH"],"itemData":{"id":25,"type":"article-journal","container-title":"Mind, Culture, and Activity","DOI":"10.1080/10749039.2014.897166","ISSN":"1074-9039","issue":"2","note":"publisher: Routledge\n_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10749039.2014.897166","page":"93-96","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Designing for Change","volume":"21","author":[{"family":"Cole","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Göncü","given":"Artin"},{"family":"Vadeboncoeur","given":"Jennifer A."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,3]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RND8lp4ZkOFVi}*(Cole et al., 2014), *which describes an interplay between experience of the phenomena as a whole, the increasing understanding of the core germ concept embodied there, and then further movement towards the concrete in applying or exploring those ideas in wider context.

As a practitioner of computing education the starting and ending focus on the concrete is attractive to me. It appeals to my own identity as a self-taught hacker of web technology to server an immediate social purpose. I believe this reconnection of abstract ideas, immediately back into practice within the same context of game making helps to root wider more abstract concepts into the learning design.

This understanding drives the highly iterative nature of the learning design where game patterns are identified, selected, implemented, the wider patterns are reflected on and that knowledge is re-applied again on a new different but related game pattern. Techniques to encourage this pattern are explored in a later section on secondary stimuli.

[]{#anchor-5}Evolution of Primary Tool Use -------------------------------------------

**Summary and Starting Evaluation of types of Tools used in programme**

\[summary removed to notes\]

This section explores and describes the process of historical construction of the programme tools used by participant to achieve the primary goals of the program, namely that of making and sharing a digital game. I will describe the range of tools participants interact with and specifics of how these toolsets were altered over time in response to the needs of the community of participants. I will explore in greater detail the distinction between primary and secondary goals in the next section on dual stimuli. A summary of the primary task tools used are as follows:

-   a project brief given to participants (to make a digital platform game which ideally has a theme of an environmental issue) -   the game authoring environments (thimble, glitch.com, makecode arcade), and other sound and graphical editing tools -   the starting template game code -   step by step documentation to implement game patterns

The initial phases of delivery and design drew on literature and interview data to identify factors to consider when choosing tools. The ongoing process of choosing toolsets and evaluating their efficacy is documented in journal notes. The following, many of which are explored in earlier explorations of game making studies, emerge as particularly significant:

-   suitability for low competency level in coding and more general usability issues -   the visual appeal, emotional impact of the authoring environments -   immediacy of feedback of changes of code and response of the end product -   design of game template to allow a diversity of learner pathways designer choice for game patterns to be added -   ability for designers to easily add their own sounds and graphical representations of game elements (player, background, enemies) to increase identification with the game being made -   authenticity of the tools as part of a wider ecology of free online game element making tools -   my projected and emerging concepts of the learning dimension of the programme (see appendix)

This design process even in the early stages is was very iterative. Different version of game templates explored, prioritised, altered, merged and revised based on my evaluations in relation to factors mentioned above. Many initial ideas for changes came from journal entries after making sessions. Others came in periods of revision not happening in direct contact with the participants, but which did take into account their responses in sessions.

Summary of Iterations of Primary Tool Development

In terms of supporting resources, phase one was exploratory and responsive; I had no pre-existing supporting materials and created a starting code framework of a platform game and relied on ad-hoc facilitator support to add extra functionality to the game.

A second shorter phase involved working with one family closely to create a starting game template and quick starting activities.

The third and forth phases in early 2019 drew on this participant feedback and took a more structured approach. The resources included small scale starting challenges as A5 hand-outs, step-by-step tutorials as book chapters, and code examples as online projects illustrating key additions to the game.

In the forth phase primary tools were mostly unchanged there were extensive changes to support meta-cognition (explored later)

The last iterations took place in from October to December 2019 and a smaller pilot from January to April 2020. This programme adopted the MakeCode Arcade tool as a new game authoring too. MakeCode Arcade is an open source Microsoft educational project. It is a block based programming environment which offers hints of use in the colour coding of the main functions of each code block.

Emerging Observations on Tool Evolution by Theme

Authenticity of Authoring Tools

Initially I adopted an open project based approach and with a varied software tool set which allowed participants to create games using a combination of free-to-use online tools. They comprise a coding environment using the phaser javascript game library (glitch.com), a pixel art editor (piskelapp.com), and a sound effect generator (sfbgames.com/chiptone).

The processes involved in exporting images and sound from one website and then importing them into another seemed to match the ability of the participants well. It encouraged a feeling of growing mastery and encouraged peer interaction. The ability of some participants to use their knowledge of how to do download and upload files from the web and navigate multiple websites simultaneously and then to pass on their knowledge created a feeling of familiarity in an experience where many tools and processes were unfamiliar.

The affordances of Code Playgrounds are explored in earlier writing. My own desire to use authentic web coding languages and authoring tools stemmed from a frustration with some specialist teaching coding languages and tools which sometimes lack a progression route for novice coders who want to engage with real life projects after education programme. The lack of progression strategies is a criticism that has been levelled to the Scratch block programming language (citation needed). The use of javascript as a coding language within a wrapper of HTML and css in initial phases reflects my own positive experiences as a self-taught web designer. I took only a little knowledge of web technology and was able to complete many authentic publishing projects, a pathway which progressed to paid employment. I hoped the fact that web languages and the CodePen tool could be used for all manner of web based projects could open a new world for participants.

This observation was supported during the progress of phases 1-4 as although the starting community tool *thimble *and it's community were discontinued in 2018, the replacement tools CodePen and Glitch.com had more extensive communities of professionals using the platform to showcase new ideas, ask for help solving code problems and learning from other contributors.

Immediacy of Feedback and Immediacy of Design

One of the principles that I prioritised in the choice of tools was that of immediate feedback for participants. For example, in the code editing interfaces (see previous Illustration 1) changes made to the code on the left section take immediate effect in the resultant game on the right side of the screen.

Choices in the game template structure also prioritised an immediacy of a different kind. I structured game project code to allow participants to make large changes in the game effects and design with minimal and accessible changes to the code. One example of this is the abstraction of key game play variables to the start of the game code. Another example is the use of an array of strings which were arranged in a visually accessible format to allow for ease of level layout changes.

![\ Illustration 8: Visual formatting of an array data structure to aid ease of design change](./Pictures/10000000000002520000017BEC474EBEB6E7A5E9.png){width="15.716cm" height="10.028cm"}

These quick changes were made possible by starting with a template that participants then remixed.

Remixing as Pedagogy

In early game making sessions I asked larger groups of families to work on a game together and to begin by pooling ideas for good games, creating a storyline and a list of game features they wanted to add to their game. This approach created numerous tensions and frustrations. Participants struggled with group work and agreeing priorities, there was also a large disconnect between some participant ideas and what was technically possible in given the restraints of time and coding proficiency. To address this I returned to a tactic of remixing an existing projects that I had used with previous coding interventions Chesterman, 2015)

Remixing is well explored in research on creative coding and is a key design principle of the online Scratch community Brennan et al., 2010; Hill and Monroy-Hernandez, 2013; Monroy-Hernández, 2012). The process of working with *half baked games* or modding is given particular attention from the perspective of game design by researchers who see value in the affordances of the incomplete game to encourage quick contributions by participants and to enable programs to scale up through the embedded design principles of the uncompleted game Gee and Tran, 2016; Kynigos, 2007; Kynigos and Yiannoutsou, 2018),.

Vignette Illustrating Specifics of Game Making Practices

In phases 1-4 the authenticity of the javascript text coding environment was an important priority first learning design. The complexity of the multiple authoring environments led to tensions that the family had to learn to overcome through progress in *digital literacy* and the coding competency when trying to achieve primary game coding goals. These tensions are exemplified in the vignette of S and T, included as an Appendix. An extract of this vignette follows.

In this transcript S is the Parent. T is the Child. M is Mick the Facilitator. For the previous five mins have a shared goal of fixing an error in the software which prevents their wider objective of adding the game space pattern of adding levels to the game however the process has disengaged T. M has just resolved that error in partnership with S who reengages T.\

Comments on Vignette


Dialogue and gestures of the participants indicate that they have established a working pattern where the child directs the direction of design and tests the game play and the adult uses their more advanced digital literacy to drive the code changes and use of software tools at trickier points of the process. When there are points of game making which are within the capability of the child she is able to take over the computer to implement those changes and test the results. Even though this general pattern seems established, this process is not without conflict.

For example, this direction of design is not uncontested in this interaction. The mother is closely monitoring the changes of level design. When the child makes changes that are not clearly purposeful, the mother challenges this *'(Alarmed) What are you doing?'*. The child takes delight in surprising her mother with an unexpected design element. Additionally, after asking her mother to take back control of the keyboard the child also directs her mother to delete many 'h's' (hazards) from the game. When the mother realises the plan is to delete all hazards she protests, *"It's no fun having a game with no hazards"*. The child responds. *"It is for me."*

By this stage of game making, within the existing game design we can see evidence of some of the initial design principles. The makers have adapted starting graphics from simple blocks to incorporate their own interest of a game which encourages cycling and discourages car use. Layout design has been altered extensively. Both are drawing on funds of knowledge to do with their home interests of reducing car use and background knowledge of the conventions of digital games.

In interactions there are moments when due to code affordances designed to be within the capability of novice coders T was able to make changes of level design directly. This was als the case for design of graphical elements. T can be seen to be directly engaged at this time either through direct control of the keyboard, or step by step driving of their parent's activity. The use of the terms of the game pattens, in this case the Key and Door pattern, by T are evidence of a strong connection to the embedded concept of the game pattern and a high level of motivation to enact this being added to the game

However much of this interaction T was disengaged. Once the child had made the next design choice, the hard slog of enacting this change on a code level was down the parent S. S then ran into several barriers when trying to make the change happen. The included; lack of clarity of instructions, the reluctance of S to engage help from the facilitator (seemingly to avoid competing for attention with other groups), and being frustrated at distracting activities from their bored child.

For both participants there is an explicit awareness of game making patterns and concept of the game as a dynamic system. Both seem to drive their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game. Game making patterns are outlined by both the child and parent. They talk of adding more levels, of the mechanic of keys and doors and then progressing to another level. The child takes delight in outlining the *Key Door* pattern of game progression, singing it aloud. The transformation from the period of time when her parent was problem solving code is dramatic. I propose that a contributing factor to this motivation is the ability to replicate a familiar pattern of game play via their own work in construction. It is the ability to translate this home knowledge into their own artefact which gives a sense of mastery over an otherwise foreign environment.

It can be seen that coding difficulties and states of stuck-ness continued in the learning design despite the use of a starting code template and step-by-step help resources. As a facilitator this stuck-ness is frustrating to observe, however clearly challenge must not be designed out of a learning experience. The importance of retaining such stickyness was born out in participant interview data that highlighted moments of overcoming such code block and witnessing the desired behavior manifest on the computer screen as feeling exciting and worth the struggle. However, in this relationship there is a danger that there was a disproportionate amount of time spent undertaking correction of code syntax and other issues of code structure. These errors are beyond the remit of this beginner coders. They are not explicitly taught, and are ideally abstracted from the design, however it be possible to break code structure when altering the existing template.

The result being a reduced amount of time spent on activities such as on enacting new designs conceptual problem solving and other learning outcomes which seemed more unique to the the potential of game making. Through interactions with participants in sessions, I started to develop what felt like a tangible feeling for the amount of effort participants would put into an addition to the game based on the pay off it would provide. This judgement was then translated into choices for which game patterns were written up and suggested in the programme designs for later phases.

Resolving frustrations from coding errors** **

As explored in the commentary on the vignette, a common tension for participants is that of not being able to achieve goals due to coding errors. While the concept of learning from failure is well worn, the demotivating effect of mistakes that appear unpenetrable to solution was both palpable and time consuming to address.

Code Examples and Step By Step Tutorials

Towards the end of phase 1 I began to create code examples to illustrate of how particular commonly requested game features were implemented. These barebone game projects were hosted on a code playground. An online document in our shared google drive working space linked to these examples. I would help participants access this when they requested a certain feature. This list of game features began to grow. For phase one these code example were not particularly successful at increasing learner independence. There were differences in the code structure of their games and the examples and translation was not intuitive.

In phase 2 I began to write up the implementation of the same game features but more closely integrated with the new starting code template used. Thus these individual tutorials became much directive. The step by step tutorials were available online and also as printed A4 hand outs which were provided on request of the older participants. I have brought the workshops resources together a book published on the FLOSS Manuals documentation platform Chesterman, 2019).

Embracing Different Types of Errors

In the context surrounding the interaction outlined in the above vignette, the parent had tried valiantly to overcome a conflict caused by incomplete documentation and her own incomplete knowledge of the computational patterns used in the construction of the game's code. A way to start to normalise the experience of overcoming blocks is to get greater granularity on into the detail and types or errors. In the art of war on errors, we must know our enemy. These include:

-   **Syntax and Program Errors** are errors in your code which stop thegame from functioning at all, often resulting in a blank screen. -   ****No **Behaviour Bugs** are errors which in your code which don'tstop the game from functioning but your intended effect is notpresent when it should be. -   **Glitches** don't stop your game from running but as you play you see that there is an unintended effect. The game does something different from what we want it to do.

The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful.

Further analysis of the different kinds of errors that are likely to arrive and testing different strategies for dealing with them that take into account the zone or proximal development of the participants may provide not only useful input for the participants, but also opportunities to check understandings of processes and game patterns and computational patterns in use.

Guided Code Patching

In response to on-going frustrations of time blockages, where were commonly reflected back by participants, even after step-by-step tutorials were introduced, I added an additional layer of a more systematic structure to the existing resources. Visual aids guided where to cut and paste code patches within their code structure with a greater level of specificity see figure as an example. This addressed a common lack of detailed understanding of the underlying code structure used in the code and the importance to place code extracts in the correct function to maintain the integrity of the syntax.

![](./Pictures/10000000000003C00000021CF8C083766ADDCF9E.png){width="16.51cm" height="9.278cm"}

In making decisions like the one to include extra visual scaffolding in step by step documentations. I am balancing here many different factors of concern in the complex learning environment. These include; authenticity of programming environment and language, use of the existing structure of the phaser library, the learning process of participants getting stuck and having to resolve tensions, my time limits providing individual support as a facilitator of a group, and the patience of participants when they encounter incomplete documentation.

During this process of careful documentation I became concerned that over facilitation in this instructional way would remove the possibility for errors and thus reduce the opportunities for learning from resolving failure. However, while each stage of the process of adding game pattern was documented in as complete a fashion as possible, in practice mistakes were still made and additional customisations were made. Thus while the process did reduce dependency on my input as a facilitator there were still opportunities for me to support and resolve coding errors in person. When doing this I or other volunteers were able at times to give wider perspectives on the details of specific coding concepts and wider computational patterns. For example in terms of process, rather than writing code from first principles, this 'code patching' technique and subsequent debugging more closely represents the kinds of skills used by computer professionals on an everyday basis.

Tensions revolved by a shift to MakeCode Arcade

The emergence of a new tool for game authoring which shared many of the goals of my documentation and similar structures to those in the phaser game making library led to my reconsideration of Phaser as the only or right tool for this programme. The new authoring MakeCode Arcade is an open source Microsoft educational project which is a spin-off of the MakeCode tool originally designed to support the programming of the Micro:bit microcontroller. It is a block based programming environment which offers hints of use in the colour coding of the main functions of each code block.

It appeared fruitful to undertake a similar object on making a game for change using this new, more self-contained toolset. This was also partly in response to reflections on the loose collection of interconnected authoring tools that were used in phases 1-4 of the program. The authenticity of these separate online tools, that at times participants swapped out with favourite tools of their own, had lead to interesting observations of digital literacy associated with movement and translation of digital objects from one website to another. Clearly the use of this tool reduces the potential for the development of these rich practices. However I was interested to know how the self-contained approach of a tool which had limited audio and graphical editors within the coding environment would shift learning outcomes.

I haven't started to compare data in detail between the different authoring tools. However, Initial data from participant interviews does suggests a reduction of a general feeling of learner stress due to the simplified environment. With participants saying they were less likely to be 'bogged down' and thus that tension of unhelpful stuck-ness appears partially resolved. The reduced time using external tools, especially the online pixel art editor, did shift time spend on graphics by participants away from this activity towards ones which I began to prioritise in the emerging set of learning dimensions. Although this reduction of the more straight-forward and social task of pixel art design and application seemed to cause a reduction in some of the more spontaneous moments of peer exchange and encouragement. Due to the decreased likelihood of syntax and structure errors, there also was a reduction of time when games were in a broken state. This was useful as it fitted well with the increased focus on the value of regular play testing in later phases.

The process of coming back to create a supporting resources for this new tool allowed me to recreate and refocus supporting documents and activities with the core goals of the germ cell in mind. Additional work done to to help participants to navigate a path between the more concrete and abstract elements of the learning dimensions for this generation of supporting documents created in phase 6 are explored in the later section on secondary stimuli.

A Quick Note on the *Freedom Feeling*

In initial observations of my practice and interview data from fellow participants I identified ongoing and diverse tensions of directive approaches verses choice in creative coding environment. Learner choice is a problematic term in that it comprises inter-rated concepts. For example even in relation to this game making activity choice could be comprised any of the following or more: multiple possible activity paths, developing and supporting learner agency and the ability for makers to bring their own culture into games via graphics sound and story. In someways however the vagueness of the term is suitable to encompass diverse factors that make up a hard to pin down feeling for freedom in a learning environment that I was keen to maintain.\ \ As previously discussed, key to this research intervention are my emerging understandings surrounding the utility of *game patterns* to act as a potential as a starting fund of knowledge and to use these understandings to facilitate a variety of learning dimensions engendered by this starting point.

![\ Illustration 9: Simple Map of Game Pattern Types](./Pictures/10000000000003C00000021CF361B1BAE3556E11.png){width="12.338cm" height="6.941cm"}

The above visual summary of different kinds of game patterns acts as more than a functional list of types of patterns and instructional tutorial to achieve a primary goal, it is also a stimulus for goal setting and navigational aid to participants. My development and use of this kind of secondary stimulus tool is explored this section using the concept of double stimulation.

I write this sub-section as have found it hard to write distinctly and separately about experiences of learner freedom or choice in any of the three main sections of this writing as the issue is interweaved in all three of them. I put down this concern here as many of my design decisions for both primary and secondary tools used try to embody or enable this freedom feeling. I aim to return to these thoughts from the perspective of increasing learner agency in a final synthesis section but this is incomplete currently

More On Formative Interventions

As previously explored, to allow for development of design through experimentation I have been inspired by the tradition of design experiments and formative interventions. One of the most striking set of practical techniques are those used in Engeström's take on Expansive Learning, specifically set of processes applied in a workplace setting called Change Laboratory (CL) Engeström, 2007). The CL processes suits a formal workplace where there are existing concepts of Community and Division of Labour and Norms that have resulted in contradictions to be explored and resolved. My project is differs in that beyond general participant conceptions of what game making involves, there are few if any established community or working processes. Thus while interested in the CL process, the kind of reflective, and time intensive codesign of the core resources and primary goals of the programme seemed beyond the commitment level and interest of the participants.

A complementary take on formative interventions also from a socio-cultural perspective is exemplified by the 5^th^ Dimension project led by Michael Cole. This educational intervention used University support of volunteers, equipment and technical support in after-school settings in the San Diego area. The intervention introduced a fictional narrative to create a shared 'project' for the different participants involved to promote a shared understanding of the work via intentional goal setting Brown and Cole, 2008). The concept of the importance of project is used to encompass and engender a sense of commitment from participants Blunden, 2009), (explored in earlier sections). In the 5^th^ Dimension intervention, a narrative fiction of a 'wizard' to rapidly construct a shared sense of project. In similar approach to Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert, roles are created and breathed into life by the facilitator and affordances of the learning design to accelerate an adoption of principles of practice. (explored previously).

I am guided by the concepts behind the use of the models rather than drawn to an off the shelf application of CL processes or similar interventions. While some of the material used in CL and the fictional device of the 5^th^ Dimension supports their primary tasks, others could be said to be support secondary considerations of navigating learning, establishing shared concepts and communities and reflecting on transformations in practices or understandings. These dimensions are sometimes explored in CHAT using the term of secondary stimuli used to facilitate and complement the primary task as part of the concept double stimulation.

Situating Double Stimulation in relation to this Research

The concept of double stimulation originates with Vygotsky and is extended and adapted by CHAT researchers especially in research associated with Change Laboratory Engeström, 2007; Sannino, 2015). In this section I explore these interpretations and make slight adaptations as I apply the concept to my own research design. Vygotsky 1994, p. 204) describes double stimulation as "a particular method of experimental investigation... using two groups of stimuli... One group of stimuli has the function of a task toward which the activity of the experimental subject is directed, whilst the other takes on the function of signs which help to organize the activity".

Most commonly described as method, double stimulation, put simply, involves providing experimental participants with the means (second stimulus) to express an internal states of mind in response to a task set as a first stimulus Sannino, 2015). While Vygotsky did not originally anticipate the artefacts of secondary stimulation to be ones purposefully designed by the experimenter, and thus termed them "neutral stimulation" Engeström, 2007, p. 373), other writers have started to use this term to encompass just this kind of deliberate use Valsiner and Veer, 2000). Engestrom finds the term neutral problematic as such stimuli are often embedded with affordances and potential of various kinds.

Application of Double Stimulation to my Study

In the context of my study, I have divided up the tools used in my intervention based on Vygotsky's distinction above, but using an the later interpretation to include tools which are explicitly designed by the researcher / facilitator.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Primary Stimuli / Tools                                                                                                       Secondary Stimuli / Tools   a project brief given to participants (to make a digital platform game which ideally has a theme of an environmental issue)   lists or visual representation of choices of game patterns to add to starting template   the game authoring environments (thimble, glitch.com, makecode arcade), and other sound and graphical editing tools           non-digital games to facilitate goal setting, identity exploration and reflection on learning   the starting template game code                                                                                               Informal spoken or interaction with facilitators or emails between participants and practitioners   step by step documentation to implement game patterns                                                                         fictional narratives and drama processes to to facilitate goal setting, identity exploration and reflection on learning   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In facilitated settings like my game making environment, secondary stimuli may provoke a different kind of interaction, and may take various forms, and happen at more than one occasion Sannino, 2015). The method can be used to facilitate collaboration initiated by the experimenter with participants to explore the goal of the participants Blunden, 2010).

At this stage the concept of second stimuli in relation to my project design is used as a rule of thumb to help navigate and comment on the variety of tools used in the program and the various objectives they serve. There are sometimes overlaps between primary task completion and the secondary, meta objectives in the use of some of the tools listed.

Context - Importance of Secondary Stimuli

My aims to explore the potential of secondary stimuli emerged from a variety of concerns that emerge and reoccur in my journalling of programme facilitation and design. Specifically some of these concerns are on how best to:

-   explore the learner experience as a researcher and learning designer -   exploring the capital that participants bring with them to be able to better base secondary stimuli to support they to draw on that capital -   directly aid individual participant reflection, communication and goal setting -   retain a focus as a facilitator on community interaction and to combat a tendency to be draw into solving coding errors instead -   draw out learning that is favoured or special about to the game making environment and help myself and other facilitators communicate this to and participants

The following writing explores the detail of resulting secondary stimuli which aimed to resolve tensions associated with the concerns above. Tensions which are also outlined in the introductory section above on the diversity of participant (and researcher) motivations.

Vygotsky's definition of *function of signs which help to organize the activity* allows for a huge diversity in the format of second stimuli the role they play and their complexity. In the following sections I'll explore the development and use of tools in more detail in relation to overcoming specific tensions

Overcoming Tensions related to Culture and Affect

A tension outlined in the literature are barriers to coding and complex digital practice. A common perspective being I can be paraphrased as *I'm not that sort of person *(explored in lit review). My starting thoughts for this program to address this barrier included the following perspectives:

-   The premise of family game making, of completing projects together with your parents or siblings has potential to remove the *I'm not that sort of person *barrier of cultural identity as participants are surrounded by their people. -   In a large majority of cases game playing has high exposure for parents and grand-parents (either directly or through other family members). The choice of retro (arcade / first generation) games as a medium maximises this familiarity. -   The choice of toolsets to allow participants to bring their own family interests and explore issues being discussed in the home life helps participants to draw on home funds of knowledge and discourse while learning unfamiliar processes Moll et al., 1992). -   The use of regular physical / drama games and physical making activities may reduce anxiety associated with new language acquisition Krashen, 1982) (in this case the technical terminology).

Some of these observations and starting points were the continuation of my own work as a facilitator of open making focused training sessions. Especially the use of fun, communicative drama games to create a playful atmosphere for learning. An observation from my journal during phase one of the program underscored the importance of this starting points. The value of playfulness is illustrated with one exit interview with a parent where they shared their reasons for leaving the program. At one stage after a week where they had missed a session, their family looked around and saw other groups involved in 'hardcore coding' and no longer felt at home. They compared this previous sessions which had more fun and group oriented activity.

I was struck that his incident happened during a session where I had not played customary drama games to create an inclusive environment. The games had been omitted as I was responding to a sense of urgency coming from families to solve problems. The scarcity in facilitator time drove me to crack on supporting families to debug code errors. The incident lead me to greater reflection on ongoing measures needed to prevent participant drop out for due to cultural tensions and negative affect to the working community. These include:

-   An awareness of the danger that those more confident in coding create more involved code problems that need more facilitator time, potentially making others feel less valued. -   A concern for the fragility of learners positive affect towards the group game making process and thus the need for initial playful starting and closing activities to be continued beyond initial sessions. -   The value of a stronger buy-in by participants, ideally a greater commitment to the collective making process balanced with the need for low pressure (avoiding a negative sense of obligation).

These observations were in part resolved by previously discussed issues including the more egalitarian and accessible pathways to making resources and navigating their learning. I also adapted my sessions to ensure a consistency of non-digital and playful activities. The challenges of helping participants increase their confidence and commitment in program participation are explored in the the following descriptions detailing specific activities which were added to the program.

Building Identities as Game Makers

My journal notes see an evolution of attempts to try to build into the program, activities which help build the participants sense of their own identities of game makers or more generally digital designers. In and early tentative attempt to define in broad strokes the types of game maker behaviour and underlying goals. In doing this I have taken inspiration from Bartle's game player types Hamari and Tuunanen, 2014). I translated player types to maker types based on notes in my observation journal and extracts from screen capture data. The following list of *Game Maker *types:

-   **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game -   **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step -   **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results -   **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

For examples in the Vignette of S and T's interaction we can see attributes of the child as a Glitcher. In terms of understanding of the game as a dynamic system, this is seen clearly in the parent's alarm at the child's deletion of all elements of hazard. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. "It's no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid." The child seems determined to remove all hazards. My understanding is that she is also aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play. They seem to take pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context. The process mirrors play theory concept of playing against the game or dark play Sutton-smith, 2001).

In phase three, to bring an awareness of these playing and making types into the program in a playful way I devised a game of the program which I have included in all subsequent phases. Collectively players took the Bartle test to find out what kind of game player they were.

![\ Illustration 10: Bartle Player Type Test](./Pictures/10000201000003C600000171EAA4AA8B52809BAD.png){width="17cm" height="6.493cm"}

The process was adapted so players moved around the room in response to each question. This allowed them to see how their response differed from that of their parents. The process was very engaging and quite revealing. Parents responded that the process gave them new insight into the digital life and identity of their children.

After the results were revealed, I then proposed as facilitator that my observations were that there different game maker types. I read out the different types and asked them to place themselves in a two-dimensional grid based on their self evaluation of what kind of game maker they were. Other family members were then invited to comment to see if they agreed with the positioning and if they could give examples of that behaviour.

An additional rationale for this process was to help reduce potential internal bias about the kind of process that a computer programmer should adopt, echoing the call for pluralism in approaches explored earlier in our section on germ cell concept Papert and Turkle, 1990). In short, my message was to participants there are more than one way the skin a cat. When you are learning to code follow your own preferences and try to observe and reflect on what works well for you.

Increasing Commitment and Reducing Anxiety through a Drama Frame

The value of commitment to a *Project* is explored previously in reflections on techniques to accelerate shared discourses. Previous reflections on learner anxiety led me to try to overcome tensions related to commitment and learner anxiety. The role of playful approaches and authentic contexts to reduce anxiety in language acquisition is also well documented Krashen, 1982; Young, 1992). Drawing on a lineage of the value of process drama to develop language use, Heathcote and Bolton 1994) are convincing in their advocacy of an approach called the Mantle of the Expert. Here participants adopt productive roles in a fictional community -- often a workplace -- scenario and undertake activities such as writing or design in role.

I hoped to adapt other work I had undertaken with colleagues in the MMU Faculty of Education drama department where a session was planned using a drama narrative to incorporate playful ways to increase a feeling of commitment to project work via the process of 'coding in role' Patterson et al., 2019)

In phase 3 we ran a previous intervention, as was, with families. The activity of a coding activity using HTML code to create subverts, shared an ethos of DIY expression and had a common toolset. Reactions were positive to this activity and the drama process. However the subject matter of subverting corporate surveillance via culture jamming was extremely emotive and not explicitly aligned with our overall narrative of creating games to illustrate ecological issues.

In phase 4 I drew on the techniques of this previous work to create a simple drama process for a fictional audience of visiting aliens (The Weean) in a way that was more directly aligned to encourage a range of meta-cognitive and organisation goals explored earlier.

In short, participants needed to create challenging games for the audience of aliens that showed the ability of the human race to be sensitivity to ecological issues facing our world. Failure to make entertaining and education games would prove the race to be unworthy and the aliens would be eradicate us. They were arriving at the end of the course and required weekly updates of participants goals and progress via written messages on a forum and recording video messages at the end of each session. As the course progressed participants were given game making missions by the aliens. Some were secret missions which sometimes often involved sneaky or disruptive play. These missions and opening message (brief) are included as appendices.

From my journal notes and participant interviews following phase 4, I can make the following observations. The storyline was delivered in sci-fi pastiche, unthreatening manner. Participants mentioned the value of the drama process to help creating a playful atmosphere, and many remarked on the value children made on the creative chaotic possibilities of secret mission.

Addressing Tensions related to Working Patterns and Group Structure

The brief of the game making activity is previously outlined as a primary tool. In the first exploratory phase of the interaction I encouraged larger family groups as a way of organising and asked them to adopted a more traditional 'waterfall' like approach to planning with extensive lists of feature types and planning of game narratives and graphical asset creation before getting stuck into the coding.

Feedback from Phase 1 of the course noted that some children felt locked into a simple pattern of making graphical elements which may or may not end up being integrated into the final game.

Thus in following phases I encouraged participant's preference to work as individuals or family dyads to increase the holistic experience of completing all aspects of the game making process starting with diverse goal setting from different groups in the game patterns they chose to add to their games. An additional benefit was that to the increasing resultant diversity of learner experience and paths created more opportunities for peer learning. When players play tested each other's games they gain new ideas for features to add to their game asked the respective creators how different patterns had been implemented.

Initially game makers accessed code examples and / or supporting step by step tutorials through conversations with myself where I helped them set themselves appropriate goals for their next game feature to add. I would steer them towards achievable goals a conversation which was sometimes tricky when their expectations exceeded suitable coding abilities.

There were however side effects in initial stages of the more fragmented approach to group dynamics. The logistics of using my facilitator time to support the divergent paths and very different coding errors that resulted created stretched my ability to support coding issues. As such access to my time became a bottleneck. This then caused inactivity or only allowed them a very restricted activities until their coding errors could be resolved. The bottleneck was also in place when participants wanted support to find examples.

With the increased number of groups this responsive approach to supporting goal setting, access to resources and bespoke support in solving code problems quickly became unsustainable. In addition to the step-by-step online and printable tutorials which have been described in the previous section, I experimented with various forms of secondary stimuli in particular to aid goal setting and user navigation and reflection on learning and progress. Firstly the printed step-by-step tutorials made the conversational process of aiding participants to select goals less problematic. Tutorials were printed out, placed on a table and could either be browsed by participants or brought by facilitators in response to conversations.

Thus the start of phase three there were many options available to the learners. Such learner choice can be motivational but at times choice and overwhelm and demotivate Katz and Assor, 2006; Netcoh, 2017). The following vignette illustrates this tension.

The clear excitement expressed in this vignette is tempered with some awkward pauses where there is a sense that the younger learner is frustrated at attempts to plan, prioritise and regulate activity to mitigate their sense of being overwhelmed. Witnessing these kinds of encounters lead me to think about secondary stimuli that could help participants to set goals and to keep a track of their progress.

Using a Physical Map to help Navigation of Learning

An attempt during phase three which had limited success was to create a map resembling an open world game where players would be able to roam around selecting their own quests. On this map I created islands which were inscribed with the name of the game patterns and icons. I asked participant to create a physical avatar using pixel art and a cardboard marker. At the start of the session they were asked to move their marker to an island. I attempted to group islands around themes of game mechanics or graphics, and nearer islands were easier to implement.

![\ Illustration 11: Visual representation of game patterns as a map to aid navigation](../../../Pictures/10000000000004B00000030F4D2A19B093CC3EC3.jpg){width="17cm" height="11.091cm"}

I discarded this process due to the clumsiness of my implementation but also the amount of time that it took up. I was not able to effectively evaluate its effectiveness or to effectively promote this stimuli as an effective tool to aid navigation or reflection due to other pressures competing for my time. My intuitive feeling that it was distracting to overall processes of making, and my forgetfulness in referring back to the map regularly in sessions were a barrier in an effective evaluation of its impact. However reviewing recordings of these sessions show participants interactions contains reference to the map and moving to a new area. On reflection there I feel there is promise in this approach if it can be consistently and creatively enacted.

Organising Game Patterns using Game Element Categories

In response to this unsuccessful implementation, my journal notes at this time explore me struggling to think of a simpler process to promote learner choice and navigation. My goal became to both organise the patterns to try to help participants to navigate their own learning journey and as an aid to help process of exploring the interacting component parts of a game.

In phase 3 based on feedback from participants and my own reflections on journal, entries and interviews with fellow practitioners my goal in design became to create a mix of different game patterns as a navigable menu of options which were structured in a way which has similarity to the learning design of the Game Star Mechanic program. (previously explored)

I adapted and contracted their list of concepts of to comprise solely the following:

-   Game Mechanics: things to do with the actions of the game -   Game Space: things to do with the layout of the game -   Game Polish: music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements

I revisited previously created patterns and tried to fit them into one of these three categories. As new patterns emerged on the wish list of participants, I prioritised creating resources for the most engaging, suitable in technical difficulty but also to create a balance between.

The final stage was to make an investment in time to create an webpage hub to host images and short descriptions of each of the pattern which were arranged by category and linked to the online versions of the tutorials. <https://ggc-examples.glitch.me/>

![\ Illustration 12: Game patterns listed on a web page linking to tutorials](./Pictures/10000000000007A5000009C47087927F6D7B8C88.png){width="13.032cm" height="17.988cm"}

The decision to push the online tutorials rather than printed chapters was also prompted by dual factors of wanting to encourage direct copying and pasting from online code sources rather than copying from printed versions, and the advantage for me as a reasearch of them accessing documentation in a way that could be recorded via screen capture.

This hub became the most significant second stimuli in phases 3 and 4 of the game making programme. The ability for participants to use page as a starting point to aid goal setting, to then access resources, and to keep a track of their progress.

This visual menu of game patterns help explain a possible solution to underlying tensions regarding multiple learner pathways within the boundaries that limited facilitator and learner time created. While the individual chapters were instructional and extremely directive in nature the overall process of choosing and combining different elements and variations in the material brought by participants created endless possibilities for variation.

This effect that is mirrored in complex game design. Indeed, tn the supporting book and in sessions I aimed to explain this design decision using the game metaphor of Open World Games.

*This book aims to support learners who like a more \"Open World\" approach to learning. To do this the later sections of this book take a different approach to helping you make games. You are encouraged to various different game features in what ever order you like. The chapters are much shorter and designed to be self-contained. Almost like little side or social missions that you get in great open world games *[]{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"kpSluK4d","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Chesterman, 2019)","plainCitation":"(Chesterman, 2019)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":94,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/BBIX88JR"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/BBIX88JR"],"itemData":{"id":94,"type":"report","abstract":"Free Manuals for Free Software","language":"en","title":"Phaser Game Making in Glitch","URL":"https://en.flossmanuals.net/phaser-game-making-in-glitch/_full/","author":[{"family":"Chesterman","given":""}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,19]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDvJ41Bjo4e2}*(Chesterman, 2019).*

Gotta Catch Em All -- Potential to Activate Collection Motivation

The visual division in to colour coded sections has the potential to encourage game makers to keep a track of the kind of patterns that they are adding into their game. Thus they may notice that they have added 3 mechanics but none to do with space or polish. Learning designers have been working on using the gamification technique of stimulating collection impulses to encourage learners to explore diverse pathways González and Area, 2013). A concept commonly exemplified in leaning badge schemes Gibson et al., 2015). Journal notes exploring the potential to incorporate such approaches simply in future designs include the following ideas:

To a great extent once the concepts explored above were in place the process of migrating the core of the learning design to apply to the MakeCode Arcade authouring tools was relatively straight-forward. I have recently completed a first draft of these documents which are available online here. [https://mickfuzz.github.io/makecode-platformer-101](https://mickfuzz.github.io/makecode-platformer-101/) . However, beyond this translation some adaptation and enhancements have made and these are described in this section.

Adding another category of Game Pattern

I wanted to bring ot the fore simple applications of systems dynamics that began to emerge from game making. Thus I added additional game pattern category:

-   Game Mechanics: things to do with the actions of the game -   Game Space: things to do with the layout of the game -   Game Polish: music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements -   Challenge and Systems: how different elements interact to create challenge

The challenge based patterns built on the ideas explored in the missions introduced in phase 4. It allowed a more explicit exploration of linking to concepts of system dynamics that such missions engendered. \[insert more justification based on data\]

Communicating Learning Dimensions through more a Redesign of Game Pattern Resources

When starting the MakeCode supporting documentation I was able to make the link between the format of resources to support the implementation of game patterns and the format of computing design patterns used to communicate object-oriented design concepts described in previous writing. While there is no standardisation in the format of writing up these design patterns, many follow adaptations of the seminal work of Alexander on architecture and Gamma and colleagues in software engineering McAndrew et al., 2006). An example of the elements included in a concrete example follows:

-   Name: Observer -   Intent: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object changes state, all its dependents are notified -   Applicability: (1) A change to one object requires changing other unknown objects, (2) object should be able to notify other objects, but you don't want them to be tightly coupled -   Participants: Classes are Subject, Observer, Concrete\_Subject, and Concrete\_Observer -   Consequences: (1) Abstract for broadcast communication, (2) support for broadcast communication, (3) unexpected updates -   Related patterns: Mediator, Singleton

Example from Seffah and Taleb, 2012)

Bjork and colleagues 2006) translation of design patterns into the game pattern designs does not stray too far from this source, namely; Name, Description, Consequences, Using the Pattern, Relations.

I included an adapted summary of these process of describing patterns in each of the game patterns in the MadeCode focused documentation. A screenshot of this description is included below.

The final two categories of Coding Concepts and links to other computing patterns are included to support participants to navigate between more concrete details of implementation and wider abstract concepts, a process explored in other parts of this writing.

Stabilising Learning Dimensions and Course Structure

I was hesitant at the time of writing resources for the glitch resource to include facilitator guidance and links to materials exploring possible learning dimensions beyond the most basic summary of the ethos of the program. However the inclusion of the coding concepts and wider computing patterns in the participant facing game pattern descriptions above forced me to consolidate my emergent thoughts on the possible and most promising learning dimensions of the programme. The current framework is in the appendix. This work is still on-going, especially in the areas of 21^st^ Century Skills and the example behaviours of each dimension of design practices . An updated version will be maintained at the following URL -- <http://mickfuzz.github.io/makecode-platformer-101/learningDimensions>

In addition to the consolidation of learning dimensions I used the creation of this iteration of support documents to try to translate my experiences of facilitation these sessions into a five session course. I am still hesitant about the external utility of this process. The way facilitators approach their sessions is very particular to their style. However, in line wih the ethos of design approaches, the personal utility of 'designing for others' and publishing for imagining this external audience has helped my prioritise and codify the diversity of facilitation techniques. The five week course outline is available at the following URL -

[]{#anchor-7}Synthesis (NOT FULLY FORMED) -----------------------------------------

While this section s not fully formed it is included to give a perspective on next steps of writing.

Secondary Stimuli to build Participant Agency

In the last section detailing the specific of secondary stimuli in my evolving design. It is possible to draw together the threads of the different interventions to point to a broader goal of their implementation. The common theme of wider objectives of helping participants set goals, get access to resources and reflect on their progress, is the process of increasing their agency as learners.

Facilitation around the Germ Cell concept

I want to return to the topic of facilitator implementation of the germ cell concept of facilitating exploration of concrete coding, and more abstract computing and systems concepts using game patterns as a starting point. Specifically, we can examine the most direct type of secondary stimulation, spoken dialogue between facilitator and participants. How have my understandings of these interactions evolved through the lens of the Germ Cell concept.

My conversations often started along the lines, what are you working on. These informal but very direct inquiries are documented in ongoing recordings of conversations. My own journal notes also aim to track the effectiveness of these encounters. Often in retrospect I note my focus on the immediate mechanics of overcoming coding problems but fail to name, explain the more concrete coding concepts, let alone point out their wider application. This omission to point out a particular learning experience.

This focus on the immediate concrete and not the pattern in the interaction was appropriate in the early interventions when there were no supporting resources, however a greater shift to external resources allows facilitator interactions to the area of ds type input , about specifics of terms of computational concepts used, and about wider patterns of computational design.

Thoughts on Mutual Evolution of Tools

Returning to cultural historical aspect of the development of tools and involvement of participants.

Next Steps

Moving forward, the ability check shared understanding with participants about the activities and the learning happening via spoken interactions can be seen a key indicator of the success of the germ cell strategy of the design. The evolution of the learning dimensions framework based on a grounded approach, can now be used to help participants and other facilitators with this process.

The process is very much inspired by in the work of Roque and Petrich and Bevan 2015; Roque and Jain, 2018). The process of trying to bring a structure to a messy process and to help participants, researchers and practitioners to be able to map and capture progress of understandings without destroying the fun and enjoyable chaos of the activity has been a rewarding challenge.

At time of writing I am in still in the process of gathering data and many of the more recent observations and alterations of secondary stimuli have yet to be fully tested. I am looking forward to see how much of this key tension of 'mapping the messy' can be resolved by this germ cell process.
