**Learning Through STEM-Rich Tinkering: Findings From a Jointly Negotiated Research Project Taken Up in Practice**

The authors bring a new focus of the a tinkering learning environment to a tool listing design principles and a list of learning dimensions created in a study of after-school STEM activities described as ISE, informal science education, (Table 1 and 2) (Petrich et al., 2013). There were revision of the original learning dimensions and much more detail given in the description of the indicators (Table 4).

We can see a broadenening if scope beyond the designing for tinkering to create a framework for gathering evidence of learning.

The additional detail has been added in a collaborative process between researcher and practitioners with a goal of creating a framework that can be used as a base for enhancing practice in a tinkering setting. Some of the differences are due to the increase specificity of materials, ie being of physical nature, others categories such as engagement are similar.

What follows is a brief commentary on the four categories identified.

**Engagement**: the focus on duration and frequency of engaging with activities and the affect or demonstrations of emotion in the process. I would be interested to cross reference this with other definitions of engagement (Whitton and Moseley, 2014). Indeed there are similiarity to Whitton and Moseley's framework for engagement in the other learning dimension indicators of this framework.

**Initiative and Intentionality:** The team noted that intentionality was present in nearly all interactions of participants and thus clarified its use to relating to the problem space in focus at the time. There was also a great value placed on an initiative which went beyond the open ended approach to solve a problem imagined by the participant. This is referred to as intellectual courage.

**Social Scaffolding:** This choice of term rather than solidarity places a greater emphasis on the planning and interventions of facilitators to create an environment where supportive interactions take place. Specifically the organisations of the space and materials in it aids the peer-assistive process. There are potential links here to organising a coding club that has physical artefacts or online processes which mirror this support. This report uses the transcripts of interactions to make this link between design choices and learning outcomes explicit and evidence based.

**Dimensions on Understanding**: This replaces the Innovation category as researchers felt that it was unrealistic to try to measure the newness of knowledge or process in day visitors to the museam. This category of understanding is wider than standards focused fact recall but still aims to justify tinkering as an activity with concrete outcomes. Thus evidence of realisations, peer explanations, application on learned and prior knowledge, and the complexification of problems. There is a duplication of persistence here with intentionality which values the idea of overcoming problems and responding intuitively to new challenges. This is consistently valued in other parts of the text specifically the "improvisational" qualities of learning via tinkering.

**Summary and Suggestions of Further Reading**

[[The original chapter]{.underline}](https://tinkering.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/PetrichWilkinsonBevan-ItLooksLikeFun.pdf) that is the starting point for the framework is worth exploring in full. The broader focus of OSE may be more in keeping with the focus of a study exploring media literacy / computational thinking.

The authors point out that the focus here on learning outcomes/ possibilities rather than setting and activities makes the study unusual compared to other studies of tinkering.

In summary the authors highlight that beyond engagement as being present or completion of tasks, the open ended nature of tinkering allows for more moments of transition, of starting again, refocusing, scaling up of ambition of projects, which in turn allow for evidence of persistence, improvisation and identification with the process which give potential to map a more nuanced analysis of engagement (Whitton and Moseley, 2014).

This focus on museum learning is illustrating in the reading list.
