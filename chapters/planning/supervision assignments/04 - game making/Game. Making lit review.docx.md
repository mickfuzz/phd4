Literature review on game making

**Background and limits**

Firstly this area is huge so, looking at digital games mostly but alsoareas of overlap with non digital games if there is something that canbe useful to explore in a family learning context.

Also if looking at game mechanics and systems, which can be most usefulin this family learning environment.

Defining terms is important but hard to do in time available

-   What are games?

-   What is making, generating something new?

When does playing about with stuff become game making, either with dramagames, improvised sport games?

Could find an author. To ask that question de kovens?

Wrap up quickly giving a working definition, maybe include above ascomment.

Cover some Wide theories on games and mechanics , that can apply to all.

maybe why some games don't work,

could bring in flow here.

Ideally look at a few frameworks and use one to explore key elements ofgame making, with potential to be linked to family learning, and thepick one to use as base for this section, and outline deficienciescompared to one of the others.

Focus o. Making element thus engagement , and deeper understanding ofmechanics

**Contextual info for introduction **

**Government push**

Uk and USA stem pipeline argument

Pushing computational or systems thinking

Linking also to 21st century skills, example of quest to learn here

**Cultural approach, **

As a hobby

looking at game jams,

joy of collaboration and collective culture,

As a vehicle for collaborative production in a new medium of attention.

**Diy Experiments on psychology**

How much of this pleasure is through exploring what makes a goodchallenge, flow experience, thus understanding more about what makespeople tick, ie strong meta cognitive learning potential.

This could be explicit or implicit.

There are mirrors here about the gamification of status updates, anegative exploration of what makes people press like.

**Inclusivity and game making.**

A critical approach of maker culture in the review of literature, howmuch is this a tech thing or how much a cultural capital thing ?

Where does the confidence to alter rules and making your own additionscome from?

Link to creative, generative play.

But the move to more formally create a rule set as a game, is a stepbeyond this in non digital games, board games even more so,

Is this even really a family activity

**The mechanics of sharing**

Broad history of non digital game making , non commercial diy approach

Explosion in digital distribution

Link with participatory culture, bastard culture , and look at gamemodding

Find a study on the mechanics of the distribution,

**Community behaviour**

and go into detail about the the collaborative creative process,in anonline community

-   Ie scratch community

-   And itch io

-   And mario maker

How is this reflected in smaller communities

Maybe this is where the gap is.

Between individual learning , and macro communities online and thus easyto study.

**Factors in digital making modding**

Other issues of making or modding include;

-   Scope of creation, presets for mechanics like little big world,    > mario or from scratch

-   Make own assets or not

-   

Can we draw parallels with. Game making in non digital environments, ifso what?
