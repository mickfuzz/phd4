Collaboration, creativity, reflection, communication as 21^st^ Century Skills-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitions of 21^st^ Century Skills vary widelyBinkleyet al., 2009). In an analysis of wider frameworksVoogtand Roblin, 2012), twenty first century skills have been summarised ascollaboration, communication, ICT literacy, social/cultural skills &citizenship, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving andproductivity/development of quality products. As such, many definitionsinclude areas of design and systems thinking that we have alreadycovered in this review of game making studies. Such overlaps isinevitable in this grounded approach to giving an overview of theconcerns of the literature. This final section will concentrate onstudies which include findings on issues of collaboration, communicationand critical thinking.

TEXT ON THIS SECTION TO FOLLOW.....

In terms of group communication and collaboration, while research hashighlighted the potential of game making to encourage collaboration,there are comparatively few emprical studies available to support thisclaimEarpet al., 2013). .

This section is a bit of a catch all, for wider C21, skillsBerminghamet al., 2013)

We can see a direct link to studies surrounding game playing in the areaof the value of linking activities to promote reflection.

Concepts of mulitliteracies wider definitions of digital literacies, andstudies supporting this., and more specifically attempts to designlearning environments which support this kind of approach.

The acquisition of these multiliteracies are often said to happenthrough engagement with additional activities around the game. Geerefers to this as metagaming, (where?)

This is a b

Discourses in this New Literacy context can comprise a wide variety ofcommunication forms to include "the burgeoning variety of text formsassociated with information and multimedia technologies"TheNew London Group, 1996, p. 61). In the context of computer games this isparticularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements whichmay including online play or internet forums which containconversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis,live chat possibilities and so on.

Kafai and Burke also look to embrace possibilities of online platformsthrough 'connected learning'2015).They use a social lens highlight studies from Denner on pair programmingas an effective social intervention in middle schoolDennerand Werner, 2007), and reference an study on peer interactions in gamecreation in LogoChingand Kafai, 2008). The later study builds on previous analysis of thelimits of teacher support in project based approaches, advocates morepeer interaction as a tactical response, and develops a model to allow aricher description of helping activities.

Discussion -----------

Some if not all of this topic suit introduction and some development inthe introductory chapter.

Computational Thinking Widened as Power Grab

Widening definitions of computation thinking.

Resnick's work extends concepts, and then practices and perspectives.

Kafai, widens scope to include personal, social, cultural and tangiblepractices in a model which in cludes computational participation as akey skill, claiming that 'The framing of learning as personal, social,cultural and tangible is key in realizing that computational thinkingneeds to move beyond mere problem solving.'Kafaiand Burke, 2014, p. 3)

Could give overview of Resnick and Kafai on take on CT which is (basedthe tenents of constructionism) -Brennanand Resnick, 2012). espc

The reframing of various design and problems solving skills within acertain subject area, can be seen to be a political decision, however,there is evidence that this has not been successful in UK despiteextensive rebranding and retraining focusing on the wider value ofcomputational thinking.

Software, Affordances and Pedagogical Implications

This is present in the framing and explicit aims of some of the softwaretools which are brought into this domain. As an example we can look atan analysis of Games and SquireGamesand Squire, 2008). ) They describe early efforts like the Boxer languageand LOGO as situated as as a tangible environment to allow more concreteapproach to programming but one which retains a need to teachfundamentals of programming before students can progress to adapting thetool to their own designs or games.

Scratch has an aim to lower barriers to entry much further via a visualapproach to language construction and to extend possible project aims tomaximise user engagement and accessibility .

In contrast other Games and Squire position a software tool likeGamestar Mechanic as more directly leveraging the pre=existing knowledgeand motivation to create games which are presumed to be already part ofthe discourse of young people.

In many ways this returns to the debate of bricoleur vs abstractdesigner which was identified early in observations of the way learnerslearn to codePapertand Turkle, 1990).

Papert and microworlds, locating a genesis of situated thinking,constructionism, in comparison with piagets focus on decontextualisedabstract knowledge, see Ackerman and other female authors in hard vssoft approaches

PERHAPS end of this return to the source and wrap things up here.

Lack of Studies that conform to certain standards

There is a clear lack of studies that conform to a rigour educationalresearch approach as outlined by Cohen et al .

I would agree that more rigourous studies would be useful. At the sametime, this lack could explained by several factors including; therapidly moving characteristics of the toolsets which suits pilotstudies, and the high level of expertise. enthusiasm and experienceneeded to balance the multiple competencies of programming concepts andgame design patterns.

Part of this may be due to the challenge of context outlined in the nextsection and reluctance to devote the time needed to progress with aproject based approach to curriculum knowledge acquisition which deepensunderstanding of context but at the expense of time covering othermaterial.

Returning to the challenge context

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale forintegration of playing complex games in schoolsFrancis,2006). Game making is time consuming. To convince educational managersof a broad potential , a common tactic of many studies to propose gamemaking at a way to deepen subject knowledge. However, based on currentresearch results this is problematic.

Kafai and Burke highlight that the conception of a mutually supportive,dual foci of coding abilities and content study was central to earlyconceptions of constructionist gamingPapert,1980). However, while advocating such an approach, they do concede thatit can be problematic in practice. Studies outline a key issue hinderingcontent communication through game making activities is a tendency forthe mechanics and processes of game creation to take a precedence overcontent exploration.Kafaiet al., 1998; Ke, 2014) .

These difficulties of application are in part why this study focuses onthe potential of a family learning environment to act as a moresupportive and flexible space for such complex learning.

In focusing on the area of family learning it is not my intention todisregard the potential for game making in more formal environments. Ido however wish to avoid an overly idealistic or realistic perspectiveon such potential which ignores the level of resources available toprimary and secondary schools. I feel that such an approach a moreresponsible approach to that of some of the advocates of digitalstrategies which seems to be belittling to schools or professionals notintegrating interactive, creative digital environments into theirclassrooms.

I will now examine key studies to bring out issues of scalability andsuitability of classroom integration and to draw out particularcontextual challenges. I also wish to highlight the potential for familylearning environments to address some or all of these issues.

-   **Time on task:** even with double periods sometimes you just need    to keep hacking through a problem, Family-   **Level of support and mentor:** student ratio:-   **Motivational and emotional support:** part of the process of    overcoming hard coding problems is motivational

The importance of Making

David gauntlet and DIY making, making as a way to pause for thoughtbefore answering or discussing, particularly of interest in terms ofmethods hereGauntlett,2007).

The social structured of the learning environment and design is one thathas been explored extensively by key researchers into hands on scienceeducation at museam, see Tinkering from Exploratorium for more info.

Areas here for motivation and accessibility too linking back to factorsof design
