1.  Overview of Family Learning     ============================

    1.  ########## **Background and Introduction **

Introductory Thoughts---------------------

The term Family Learning is complex in that it can encompass alllearning happening in a home learning environment or on visits outsidethe home with family members or may refer to more formal provision. Thisattempts to explore various contexts all on a spectrum of more formalprovision in state provided spaces and more informal dimensions oflearning happening in the family home. To do this I will examine studiesdealing with family involvement in early years play-based provision,family literacy programmes and finally more informal learning happeningin the digital technologies in the home.

In future writing, to move beyond an exploration of context and casestudies, I will underpin this exploration in the light of asocio-cultural approach. In this way the mechanisms for social exchangeand shared construction of emergent understandings will be highlighted.

Context of Family Learning Provision------------------------------------

In UK Family Learning (FL) and and the home learning environment (HLE)have received more attention since research indication the preschool HLEto be one of the most significant factors on later educationalattainment and developmental progress (Melhuish et al., 2008;Siraj‐Blatchford et al., 2008).

This section covers funded Family Learning programmes in the UK. Familyin this context is normally taken to mean one or more family members ofwhich one is a child and other fulfilling a parental role, which couldbe a parent, grandparent, relative or sibling (Lamb, 2009). Recentreviews adopt a similarly broad definition of FL to encompass streams ofactivities streams of activity are identified as Family Literacy,Language and Numeracy (FLLN) and Wider Family Learning (WFL), the formerfocusing on the relevant key skills and the latter following a broadercurriculum including creative activities, music, and digital literacies(Brooks et al., 2008; Carpentieri, 2012; Grant, 2009; Lamb, 2009;*Review of family learning*, 2016). Lamb (2009) notes that thiscategorisation may be seen as more administrative than pedagogical innature, citing two relevant funding streams available in the UK from theLearning Skills Council. Potential outcomes and dimensions of familylearning include "progression, self-confidence and self-esteemmotivation and self-efficacy aspirations and ambitions parentingpractices, human capital, social and cultural capital" (Lamb, 2009).

While the value of a positive home environment is well established(Siraj‐Blatchford et al., 2008), research on the impact of FL programmesis limited (Brooks et al., 2008; Lamb, 2009; Swain et al., 2014. Whileevaluation is mostly focused on the literacy outcomes of childrenrelated to FLLN programmes, broader benefits have been identified. Theseinclude parents reporting more confidence in how to support theirchildren's learning, increased time spent in home activities withchildren, improved literacy and confidence surrounding literacy forparents, and greater contact with schools (Swain et al., 2014).

Play in a Family Learning Context---------------------------------

A key line of research concerning the importance of the home learningenvironment (HLE) is the longitudinal study EPPE (Effective Provision ofPre-school Education). This study gathered data of pre-schoolenvironment of young people and found that the a stimulating HLE to bethe most significant factor in determining progression in cognitive,social and behavioural skills (Evangelou et al., 2005; Feinstein et al.,2004). In this section family play is considered in the context of howstate provision aims to support it and as a vehicle for the explorationof interrelated the helping strategies of scaffolding and sustainedshared thinking.

Needham identifies parent toddler groups, or "stay and play sessions" inthe UK as an under-researched area (Needham, 2011, p. 91). He charts ashort history of disparate playing together sessions with littlegovernmental support before 1997 and a growth of supported sessionsunder New-Labour which develop into increasingly sophisticatedpedagogical interventions which encouraged parents to engage and supportwith their child's play processes (Anning et al., 2005).

An exploration of the terminology of play and games will be exploredelsewhere in my writing but for the purposes of this section it isimportant to note a key distinction between two key categories of play,namely between epistemic play and ludic play (Hutt, 1979; Marsh et al.,2016). Epistemic play comprises personal explorations to gain knowledgeof surrounding objects and environments whereas ludic play draws onfantasy and symbolic play with a greater focus on interaction betweenindividuals.

This distinction is important as it reflects a broader shift in theapproach of early years literature away from personal cognitivedevelopment towards a sociocultural approach to education. Needhamcontends has this shift yet to be fully realised in the context ofpolicy and practice in early years provision (Needham, 2011). While theEYFS framework explicitly acknowledges the importance of key sociallearning practices (Sylva et al., 2004), there are still a greater focuson individual exploration and learning designs within the EYFSliterature. This focus can be attributed to the legacy of the influenceon previous educational policies of a piagetian focus on cognitiveprogress through individual exploratory play (Siraj-Blatchford, 2004).The implication for support of young people in practice is that adultsshould take an active role in the facilitation of more social, ludicplay forms rather than focusing only on facilitating access to learningenvironments and materials that privilege on more individual exploratoryplay.

To better help parents and professionals support and Needham and Jackson(2014) draw our attention to the desirability for detailed definitionsof relevant strategies. Jordan (2004) highlights that the termscaffolding is sometimes employed to describe adult design of learningactivities which provide support for a child's individual exploration,proposing that a more authentic interpretation is one where there ismore active support and direction by adults (Wood et al., 1976). Jordanadvances a term co-creation to describe activities which arecharacterised by high level of interaction between adult and child whereactivity goals have strong input from children rather than beingprescribed by adults.

The term "sustained shared thinking" (SST), which becomes prominentthrough the work of the previously mentioned EPPE project, has beenadopted in policy is used with the guidance documents within the EYFS.SST is broad in scope and is described as

> An episode in which two or more individuals 'work together' in an> intellectual way to solve a problem, clarify a concept, evaluate> activities, extend a narrative etc. Both parties must contribute to> the thinking and it must develop and extend the understanding.(Iram> Siraj-Blatchford et al., 2002)

Purdon confirms the widespread use of the term SST but notes lack ofclarity of understanding of practitioners (2016). Her exploration of theterm notes a strong link to Jordan's conception of co-creation in thatthe effective SST is seen to be guided by the child's interests whichthe adult explores and extends areas of shared understanding.

The concepts explored above imply the need for practitioners toappreciate the value of development of intersubjectivity through theconstruction of shared understandings in the zone of proximaldevelopment. Understandings of these concepts and how professionals putthem into practice also impact on family learning in that theexpectations of professionals of how adults can support children'slearning may influence those of parents they come into contact with andmay even cause tensions in settings where parents and professional areboth present (Needham, 2011). As an example practitioners who have amore traditional understanding of scaffolding as a designed support maydisapprove of parents who take on a more directive approach tointeractions in play settings (Whalley, 2007). To facilitate SST in playadults are guided to draw on the interests, culture and understandingsof children and then extend them by sharing their own experiences andobservation (Evangelou et al., 2008; Pramling-Samuelsson and Fleer,2009; Purdon, 2016). This is explored in more detail in the nextsection.

Family Literacy---------------

### Broadening conceptions of literacy and the value of context 

As previously described a large part of funded family learning in the UKis in the area of numeracy and literacy. There has been a relativerecent broadening of the research on literacy to include non-schoolenvironments and wider conceptions of literacy to includenon-traditional texts, which may be graffiti, internet chat or computergames (Gee, 2004a; Hull and Schultz, 2001). One relevant line ofresearch explores the possibilities for educators to draw on theliteracy practices and resources constructed in non-school settings inmore traditional settings (Moll et al., 1992). Here home culture andcompetencies related to household functioning or wellbeing are describedas 'funds of knowledge' (Moll et al., 1992, p. 133). The authorsdescribe how such funds can be leveraged in literacy work in school andafter school settings.

Developmental work by Pahl and Kelly (2005) explore multimodal texts asa vehicle for family expression in case studies of joint work in familyliteracy classrooms. While the authors acknowledge the value of studiesof literacy situated in discrete out of schools locations and practices,they are guided by the work of Leander and Sheehy, to evolve beyondsituated literacy to explore movements between these sites (Leander andSheehy, 2004).

In addition the movement of texts between existing home and schoolsettings, Pahl and Kelly's study investigated the potential foremergent, discursive learning happening. To do this they draw on thework of Moje et al. (2004) using third space theory. The integration offunds of knowledge from the first space of home environment and moreacademic discourses of the second space of school create a new thirdspace. Moje and colleagues convincingly describe the value of thirdspace interventions to build the skills of young people to navigatediverse texts and discourses from multiple funds as preparation foracademic and professional life.

Third spaces allow more complex explorations learner identities and arethus seen to be more equitable to minority group learners (Gutiérrez etal., 2011). The exploration and hybrid approach to literacies here is inline with the sociohistorical importance of culture and an expansiveview of learning (Engeström, 2001, 1999).

    EMERGING SECTION PLEASE IGNORE    ------------------------------

     Digital Play and Making in a Family Context    -------------------------------------------

This section explores studies which look at learning happening in familyenvironments through more naturalistic studies. I will explore contextand then some of the findings of the research which may be of mostrelevance to my study, namely the area of digital and media andlearning.

### Family Interactions in the Home

Many studies show parental roles of regulating screen time and otheractivities to negotiate access to digital media are more prevalent thancreative co-use (Hollingworth et al., 2009). Other studies identifyparental anxiety about lack of as a barrier to participation in jointdigital activity and conversely the role of children as the technologyexperts in some households (Correa et al., 2015; Roque et al., 2016).Ito explores this as a upsetting cultural norms of 'parent as expert'(Itō, 2009, p. 39). Intergenerational digital activities are not alwayspresented as problematic, for example parental involvement in video gameplay seen as positive for communication bringing families closertogether (Itō et al., 2010).

Ito advances the concept of messing around, and geeking out as aprogression of technical proficiency and creative production. While notexclusive to a family setting, Ito sees family environment as one of themore suitable spaces for this kinds of more exploratory messing aroundto happen, along with friendships groups, interest driven groups oryouth oriented informal programmes, the required characteristics beingthe lack of a concrete end goal required by more formal learningprogrammes (Itō, 2009, p. 44).

Other studies explore material with a focus on intergenerationallearning and playing video games as a broadly participatory andcommunicative practice (Cucinelli et al., 2018; Kangas, 2010; Ouellet etal., 2017; Siyahhan and Gee, 2018),

The theme of digital media allowing a the emergence of possibility of awhat Lessig terms Read / Write culture (2009), is explored in a youthcontext extensively (Clinton et al., 2006; Gee, 2004b; Gee and Hayes,2012; Jenkins, 2008, 2006; Peppler and Kafai, 2007). others are evennarrower and look at making as in intergenerational activity (Brahms,n.d.; Crowley and Brahms, 2016; Ouellet et al., 2017; Romero andOuellet, 2016; Roque et al., 2016; Roque, 2016; Sefton-Green, 2013).

Ito and colleagues note that generative activities (compared to moresocial interactions) are the exception rather than norm even inexpressly creative communities. (Itō et al., 2010). Sefton-Green sharesthis concern about exceptionalist case studies in digital making, andthus scalability of making processes, is underscored by in-depth studieson informal, digital communities. This provides a challenge foreducators seeking to harness the potenial of 'funds' present in homeinteractions in a more structured way.

### Family Interactions in facilitated spaces

These areas are still distinct from the formal spaces of training. Theyare informal, third spaces as explored earlier.

**Facilitation**

The value of face-to-face facilitation of family interactions hasexplored from multiple perspectives using a variety of methods, forexample in the work of Roque and Bevan and colleagues (Bevan et al.,2015; Roque, 2016).

When Ouellet at al. (2017) studied inter-generational game making theyfound that some of their assumptions were erroneous as such that olderparticipants were not always less proficient at computer use. Theauthors cite the research of Plowman and colleagues to say this backs upthe claim that

Plowman and colleagues (2008) also were puzzled at the ways parentsreferred to the process of younger family members 'just picking up'digital skills. They looked to guided participation as a framework toexplain the learning processes occuring (Rogoff et al., 1993). They notethat while explicit teaching is not present, family members areconstantly modelling behaviour.

8.  **Culture and context**    -----------------------

    Parental facilitation roles are also explored as one of the influences of cultural expectations are explored by Siyahhan and colleagues in a study which used Activity Theory as a framework for to analyse family learning in digital game playing (Siyahhan et al., 2010).     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blum-Ross and Livingstong locate a history for informal digital trainingin community-based and political training (2016). The authors note amove to more individual storytelling, then creativity, then tech focusof DML, then subsumed by a computing curriculum focus more in line withhard skills focus of the government.

Livingstone explores the individualisation of the context of communitymedia, and out of school settings provided by extra funding (Blum-Rossand Livingstone, 2016) (explored in Livingstone piece where communitymedia based around social action). She points out that this direction isin keeping with a wider de-contextualisation of learning in schools andthat this trajectory is at odds with the momentum behind contemporaryresearch which emphasises the importance of context in the learningprocess.

The challenge to facilitators to integrate home culture and practices isexplored by Brahms (2014) in her study of family learning in the contextof a science museums .

The problem of parental involvement from the perspective of schools.

Wider work on the role of parents in digital environments for kids arein depth and instructive. There are class distinctions about who makesdigital content (Livingstone et al., 2018)

**Next Steps **

The following tensions or oppositions in the area of family making areof interest to me for future exploration; the difference between soloand group making, less guided exploration compared to more structuredapproaches, approaches to family media making that allow for culturalexploration of material already relevant to the family and widersocietal issues.
