*This writing is a potential extract from my literature review, as such,some concepts that would have previously explored in literature aroundgame playing and Digital Game-Based Learning will have already beenexplored. I will make reference to those in this extract when there is across over between the pedagogy of game playing and game making. *

Game Making and Pedagogy========================

In this extract of writing I will give an overview of the pedagogyexplored by researchers in area of digital game making.

Summary of some of the design principles and pedagogical principles atplay

Due to the complex environments of game making and the many possiblelearning processes at play it is not obvious how to dissect andcategorise them neatly in this way.

Instead I will look at research categorised by underlying educationalmotivations for making games in a learning context, namely; the deeplearning of subject content, creative and design approaches(specifically to understand making games), the technical skill ofsoftware coding, faciliating collaboration and communication, andfinally game making as an accessible way to promote access totechnology, particularly for girls.

Kafai and Burke note the limits of the simplicity of a similarcategorisation in a review by Hayes and Games noting that there is a lotof crossover in any such divisionKafaiand Burke, 2014). Given these limits, it is still a practical way toexamine the details of

In terms of wider perspective on learning, the following pedagogicalapproaches care identified in context of these studies; constructivistand constructionist approaches, discovery learning, situated learningand social-cultural approaches

(to be explore further in other writing).

-   Constructionist approaches, use of materials, diving in (linked to    situated learning)    Kafai    and Resnick, 1996).

Contextual Background ----------------------

While as Prensky (?) notes, interacting with digital technologies hasbecome more commons for younger digital natives, there are other skillsbeyond interaction that are a wider definition of digital fluencyKristianKiili et al., 2012).

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale &integration into schools of COTS games. see (Francis, 2006)

CROSS OVER HERE -- difficulty of integration of game making is similar -

FIND -- literature on the challenges of integrating Game Making intoschools.

These difficulties are in part why this study focuses on the potentialof a family learning environment to act as a more supportive andflexible space for such complex learning.

Also, from Hayes and GamesHayesand Games, 2008), see history through modding CivSquireet al., 2005), Kafia and fractionsKafai,1994), and the subsequent revisions of design practice,

Games as a Making Activity -------------------------------

There is scope for much more of this learning in making activities thangame playing activities, simply due to the technical complexity ofcreating a game which allows multiple learner paths.

Before returning to the kinds of learning that happen in the process ofgame making it is beneficial to explore the pedagogic characteristics ofthe recent emergence of making as a new learning movement.

INSERT MATERIAL ON MAKER MOVEMENT HERE

The complexity of activities carried out in games can be seen as acommunity ecosystem similar to that of a workplace.

The work of Lave and Wegner around communities of practice. Explainconcept of legitimate peripheral participation

A very useful paper on learning by design and some of the prerequisitsKolodneret al., n.d.).

Games as a game design activity-------------------------------

A distinction between constructionist approaches to teaching programmingto open up future possibilities of design, to a more acceleratedadoption of game design discourseGamesand Squire, 2008).

Linking to the professional habits of game design via Salen andZimmerman,

Making this more educational via Torres, and then embodied in the GSMtool.

And wider still design thinking in education and studio thinkingHetlandet al., 2013; Hokanson, 2013; Hokanson and Gibbons, 2014). This linkwith arts based practice is made inDenhamand Guyotte, 2018). How much this is a useful contribution isquestionable, as there are perhaps more direct links with the generalprocess of design that are more closely related to the generation ofdigital artefacts,

We can also for example Resnick's take on iterative spiral designprocess linked to a kindergarden processResnick,2007).

Provoking reflection, communication and other learning around game making-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can see a direct link to studies surrounding game playing in the areaof the value of linking activities to promote reflection.

Kafai and Burke include problem solving and design thinking in thiscategory, in this writing it is addressed separately.

This is often linked to additional activities around the game. Geerefers to this as metagaming .

Discourses in this New Literacy context can comprise a wide variety ofcommunication forms to include "the burgeoning variety of text formsassociated with information and multimedia technologies"TheNew London Group, 1996, p. 61). In the context of computer games this isparticularly rich when game playing cultures have online elements whichmay including online play or internet forums which containconversations, media created in game or around the game, help wikis,live chat possibilities and so on.

Kafai and Burke also look to embrace possibilities of online platformsthrough 'connected learning'Kafaiand Burke, 2015). They use a social lens highlight studies from Denneron pair programming as an effective social intervention in middle schoolDennerand Werner, 2007), and reference an study on peer interactions in gamecreation in LogoChingand Kafai, 2008). The later study builds on previous analysis of thelimits of teacher support in project based approaches, advocates morepeer interaction as a tactical response, and develops a model to allow aricher description of helping activities.

Itō documents the value of the informal nature of digital explorationsand identify play, and researches the resulting learning outcomesItō,2010). Diy media production and other meaning making in game playingcommunities are included in what been termed participatory cultureJenkins,2009). Any studies?

Pioneering studies on metagaming activities (Torbin & Turkle) seeFrancis,2006). Torbin, son managing a game site,

Game making and accessibility-----------------------------

While this is a wide title, it encompasses studies addressing race andgender. This is a problematic area in terms of accessing data. In areview Kafai and Burke note only 50% of studies include such data .

-   Girls Coding GCG-- Denner -- Storytelling Alice-   Roberston 2012 -- Adventure author-   Rapunsel -- Flannagan -- via Hayes and Games-   Black students game making and testing -- Glitch project -- diSalvo

Wider issue of of access to computers from disadvantaged communities.

Possibility to shift attitudes using games, Kafai cites Repenning butdata seems missing to support motivational claims, mostly anecdotal ?Repenning,2013; Repenning et al., 2015).

Less so in other study, there is survey data here.Ryooet al., 2013). and evidence of increased of take up in programme, but nocontrol?

There seems more convincing data in the Reynolds/ Globaloria data.Reynoldsand Chiu, n.d.)

Discussion -----------

Some if not all of this should be in an introductory chapter.

Returning to the challenge context

Becta and TEEM studies highlight difficulties of time scale forintegration of playing complex games in schoolsFrancis,2006).

In focusing on the area of family learning it is not my intention todisregard the potential for game making in more formal environments. Ido however wish to avoid an overly idealistic or realistic perspectiveon such potential which ignores the level of resources available toprimary and secondary schools. I feel that such an approach a moreresponsible approach to that of some of the advocates of digitalstrategies which seems to be belittling to schools or professionals notintegrating interactive, creative digital environments into theirclassrooms.

I return in this section to some of the previous studies to examine theissue of scalability and suitability of classroom integration to drawout particular contextual challenges.

I also wish to highlight the potential for family learning environmentsto address some or all of these issues.

Choice of Tools

From the conclusion of Earp and all that better pedagogic models andconstruction tools are needed, I would add that more authenticapproaches, which allow greater extension of skills are needed in tools

We can contrast tools using the low floors high ceilings and wide wallsand new windows here - Javascript in code playgrounds is favourable formany of these, and each can be covered in turn with examples from apilot study.

**Additional toolsets: **Sonic Pi, Drawing Boards, Beads, Foleyrecording audio station.

The pedagogical approaches behind the choice of toolset can be linked tothe following areas of interest

-   distributed intelligence (especially from an arts / chat background    and the use of boundary objects to externalise tacit knowledge    Cole    et al., n.d.; Fischer et al., 2005).-   experiential learning / design cycle Kolb -- an experimental design    cycle as part of a constructionist tradition kindergarden process    (Resnick, 2007).-
