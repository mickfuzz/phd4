An overview of literature on Game Design

My proposed study is on the role of collaboration in digital game makingintergenerational learning contexts. It will therefore require anextensive exploration of the literature concerning game making in alearning. What follows is a review of literature with a focus on thestudies addressing of design methodologies, systems thinking andcritical litercies inc to learning environments concerning game makingand young people. Thus some thinking around the frameworks anddefinitions involved is needed for each section.,

Digital or Non- Digital

While my choice to use digital games, specifically 2d video games as alearning medium ( a choice justified elsewhere in the study), doeseffect the focus of the following exploration of concepts, many of themare transferrable to non-digital mediums.

Design / systems approach non-digital and digital -- what's thedifference here?

As there are shared elements of rules and components in digital andnon-digital that they are equally valid to address issues of systemsthinking.

However in non-digital games these interactions must be learnt as rules,where as in digital games they are much less visibleCostikyan,n.d.).

Purpose of Game Making

Context of game making builds on a constructivist approach whichdevelops skills in a setting with purpose that is relatable to learners.

Beyond the argument of a medium of attention, we can match the potentialof game making to wider analysis of the skills needed for

-   21^st^ C skills/ Give a quick definition    Earp    et al., 2012).-   Computational Thinking    Wing, 2006)-   Computing concepts, and practices and perspectives    Brennan    and Resnick, 2012);

If CT is a subset of design thinking with more domain specific toolsGroverand Pea, 2013),

then perhaps CT here should go in the design section.

Setting the path for this lit review -- which is studies on what skillscan can be taught using games

How to set a pathway for the following ideas and frameworks?

A wide literature review identified "seven distinct -- but closelyrelated -- classes: literacies & skill

sets, individual learning attributes, inclusion, pedagogy, socialissues, technology and curriculum."Earp,2015, p. 10).

We can look at the why games arguments of Hayes and Games in theirreview of tools and strategies as a frameworkHayesand Games, 2008). As Kafai and Burke point out their categorisation ofpurpose within 4 sets namely; learning programming, getting girls tocode, learning other subjects by proxy, understanding designing concepts-- is not exhaustive and overlaps, often expresslyBurkeand Kafai, n.d.).

Kafai, has a wider framework for looking at value of constructionistgames -- peronsal learning, social and culturalKafaiand Burke, 2015).

What about the "rules, play and culture framework"Salenand Zimmerman, 2003, p. 4).

In this writing, we'll concentrate mostly on rules and play. They notethat the framework can be applied to wider contexts than game design.

Zimmerman later explores , systems, play and designPerronand Wolf, 2009). as gaming literacies, big picture stuff in thisarticle.

Other frameworks of gaming literacies exist which have a wider focus oncritical approaches and multiple literacies as well as culturesA.Peppler and B. Kafai, 2009; Buckingham and Burn, 2007). These works aimto build on media literacy and production frameworks in this emergingarea.

There are multiple areas to explore, in this review, given themotivation of developing 21^st^ Century skills, I have prioritised thefollowing;

-   developing critical literacies-   creative design processes-   game play and mechanics as systems thinking

Developing Critical Literacies

Gee and active meaning making -- perhaps merge with previous section ,making / playing

Buckingham and Burn on gaming literacies, cf other literacies, putsocial context at heart of the process. Also make a distinction betweenfunctional literacy and critical literacy in gamesBuckinghamand Burn, 2007).

The authours explore how games complicate distinctions between makingand consuming literacies

Distinction of Making vs Playing

Salen who explores game making are keen not to devalue playing elementswith an assumption that "to be a full participant, one must alsoproduce."Salen,2007, p. 308). Production is value as just one form of participationthat can build wider skills explored in the next section. One feels thatIn part this is needed to prevent the "just playing games" criticismthat can be levelled at this area.

Following constructivist princiiples we may imagine a higher potentialof making. However, while there are many studies on game playing andjustifications of learning that is happening -- Jenkins, Gee, Romero,etc, - but less on game making. Why is this, when the potential ispotentially larger

Earpet al., n.d.)?

A summary on findings of Buckingham and B's study on gaming literaciesexplore cultural, game literacies (functional and ludic) and thencreative approaches.

Their exploration of creative approaches is pretty wild drawing onslightly random elements to descibe a case study including callois typesof game / play and narrative character types, and game elements andaffordences of game making software

Their point is that more work is needed on game literacy frame works andhere are some elements.

While, it may be true that the analysis and commentary of games builds arich ecology of learner participation, for the purposes of this studythere are learning which I do believe are better suited to directproduction, and better suited to a non-formal but still guided approach.

The three-dialog model of game design literacy

Created to support the learning behind Gamestar Mechanic, draws on widedesign and new literacy litearature, with an aim to create somethingmore specific to aid analysis and assessment of literacies and languagepractice in area of making video games.

Material, Real player and Ideal playerGames,2008).

The real and ideal players reference the "virtual, real and projective"identities put forward by GeeGee,2003, p. 54).

Ideal player -- is a useful construct to aid design and helping thedesigner imagine the virtual player that the real player will projectthemselves into.

Materials components of games come with their own affordences that areoften complex,

This dialogue is important for the game or learning environment as partof **active meaning making**

This shift in perspective has parallels with the designing for othersprocess in next sectionKafaiet al., 1997; Owston et al., 2009).

Games Creative Design Process

\Summary of design in context of learning and games.

Design and learning -- kafai minds in play, Chapter one .

Kafai notes a convergence of design and learning theoriesKafai,1995).

Games as a design. - summary of what is a game, and what are the designelements,

use of this in the playing of games -- but especially in the making

Salen covers high level work on games, rules, prototypesSalen,2007).

Also strong on describing design.

Salen outlines the reflection in action of Shoen, and the link ofprocess driven and reflective design approach.

The work of Roberston on Adventure Author required understanding of thecreative process stages to support each oneRobertsonand Nicholson, 2007). These are detailed as; exploration, ideageneration, game design, game implementation, game testing andevaluation.

These activities support wide range of skillsRobertson,2012).

The stages are drawn from a mix of design fields including generalcreative process support, commercial game design and software design.

The author recognise the tension between the utility if discreet stagesand the iterative nature of the process . The value of iteration is akey feature of the work of Schoen which appears throughout theliterature on learning and designSchon,1984).

There is a good overview of the benefits of design in descriptions ofthe learning in the computer clubhouse projectResnickand Rusk, 1996). While this is short of definition this exists in laterwork.

Iteration is also at the heard of Resnick's model for creative designwhich was created in parallel with the Scratch tool.Resnick,2008, 2007).

While this model applies not just to game making as wanted to extent toother tinkering media projects, it grew out of that domain.

The model draws on importance of sharing, a theme explored by Kafai andBurke in the study of community in book andKafaiand Burke, 2014).

Linking to wider model of computational thinking and applying to theareas of moldelling, game design and robotics, this white paper advancesa model of Use, Modify and CreateAllanet al., n.d.) .

Collaboration

We can argue that collaboration is another tool which is supported bythe design process, especially the team setting of priorities, peerreview process and giving and receiving feedback. We can draw on otherareas of project based approaches to support this assumption, while wecan and project that the same would be for game making, more studies areneeded. (based on Earp + Whittons sections)

Problems solving as a skill linked to design process (rather thansystems thinking?)

Here's a study specifically on decision making and problems solvingAkcaoglu,2014).

Systems analysis via game mechanics

Gee characterises systems thinking in video games as allowing analysisof \"relationships, not isolated events, facts, and skills"Gee,2013, p. 12).

In his work on the learning design of Gamestar Mechanic, Robert Torresidentifies a key skill as the ability to recognise when multiple,dynamic relationships exist within a systemForrester,2016).

Torres identies 4 main facets of systems thinking from literature,

His work combines a comprehensive break down of five systems thinkinginvolved in the creation of games with a strategy to communicate thesecore concepts using a framework incorporating the key elements of gamesnamely; space, rules, core mechanics, components and goalsTorres,n.d., p. 111).

This idea developed at 143-148

He advocates the use of these specialist terms in game creation workshopearly on , even the incorrect use of the these terms to builddevelopment of use in situ to as supported by the work of Hmelo2000).

In this work using Gamestar Mechanic, a purpose built, Torres and otherdesigners of the game brings the process of analysing and creating gamemechanics into the realm of a formal learning approach suitable of forformal eduction and after school environments.

This can be seen as an education manifestation of a wider desire todefine terms to evolve game design processes and culturesCostikyan,n.d.).

Game mechanics defined and explored ,Sicart,2008) A narrow definition of game mechanics would be core mechanics, awider one would be to incorporate rules and thus start to be synonymouswith systems analysis -- perhaps don't bother with this

Another study on deepening understanding and application of gamemechanics looked at children's understanding of game rules form playerand game perspectivesAdamsonet al., n.d.).

The effect of systems in a game is described as game play in this studywhich aims to explore game mechanics in video games in order to helpdesignersFABRICATORE,n.d.).

One of the more advanced designs exploring game play and mechanics isQuest to LearnTekinbaş,2011, p. 55). The key learning practices are on page 55 , some overlapwith design and meaning making but some elements first two are reallynovel.
