Game Making Origins Stories===========================

Introduction------------

This writing traces the foundations and various influence of currentlandscape of games and education.

*These include *

*Computing background -- more behaviourist, Games based Learning --Prensky - *

*Game playing as literacy - Gee and more*

*Game playing as experience -- Educational background de Freitas - *

*Game Making for Educational purposes -- linked to the above really butdraws in constructionists school*

*Game making for its own sake -- professional, juul, *

Framing Terms-------------

Framing (rather than defining -- seeMayer,2012)) terms and how and who uses them can help bring to the foregrounddifferent schools and the assumptions behind them.

-   Serious Games -- game based learning?-   Hard Fun -- constructionist / tinkering /-   Affinity Groups / Cultures -- literacy-   Micro worlds -- Computing specialists-   Digital Game Based Learning -- Prensky -- who are his advocates and    critics-   Epistemic Games -- Shaffer and how this differs from Serious Games\    \

Eck in a review of DGBL divides approaches up into three areas; studentsbuild games from scratch, bespoke learning games designed byprofessionals and COTS commercial of the shelf games integrated intoclassroomsEck,2006).

A review outlines purposes as games for entertainment, a games forlearning or a serious gamesConnollyet al., 2012). Two later terms often used synonymously by some but noteindustry simulation origins of SG.

**Serious Games and Simulations**---------------------------------

From its industry training origins Serious Games have a tendency towardssimulations including health care, military, national policy budgetingDjaoutiet al., 2011; Michael and Chen, 2005; Sawyer and Smith, 2008).

This study looks at the methodologies for measuring effectiveness andnotes a huge diversity in approachMayer,2012).

There is a tendency to over evangelise the effectiveness of thisapproach. In a report by the Serious Games Incitative they marvel thatat the same time as the emergence of many wicked or messy problems thesolution comes in "paradoxically in a package that could hardly havelooked neater"Tucker,2012, p. 2). Tucker here champions games as interactive systems whichmirror the systems of policy decision making. SGI game Budget Hero is anexample of this. The goal here is normally to leverage governmentfunding on key issues to create games based on medium of attention formillenials argument.

It is easy to be sceptical of commercial market based drive. But thereare many contextual factors that can't be ignored that presentopportunities beyond commercial exploitation including the appropriationof hardware or market mechanics for other purposesSawyerand Smith, 2008).

Digital Game Based Learning---------------------------

Goals of DGBL

A model advanced in a review of motivation cited three main areas oftargeted learning and behavioural outcomes for educational games, skillbased, cognitive (declarative, procedural, strategic), and affectiveGarriset al., 2002). Connolly adopts this and extends it with additionalcognitive outcomes from other frameworks.

Categories used were as follows: knowledge acquisition/contentunderstanding, perceptual and cognitive skills, motor skills,physiological outcomes, affective and motivational outcomes, behaviourchange, soft skills and social outcomes.

Debates surrounding DGBL

Here we'll focus on some of the debate in this field as a way ofexposing tensions and different motivations in the field.

Sigurdardottir,2012) Highlights various debates in DGBL; age as a factor for DGBLparticipants, is play motivating or not ( can be sidestepped easily) &use of COTS or bespoke learning games.

Motivation

PrenskyPrensky,2005, 2001) - nade the DGBL term popular, enthusiast and advocate, thiswas needed at the time.

Critique of Prensky, was a bit over the top, digital natives as types oflearners, not so much. And Stealth Learning critiqueWhitton,2008, n.d.).

COTS or bespoke

Educational games face practical problems of the cost and developmenttime of the computer games that they compete againstWhittonand Hollins, 2008). This results in limitations of the end product interms of productions values and negative perceptions of learnersJenkins,2002).

Modding is an alternative to be exploredDeFreitas, n.d.).

Educationalists - Game playing as experience

This school of approach is inspired by early work by Gee and Jenkins.This is wides in scope extending beyond explicitly educational games toenbrace wider ecologies and practices of game playing and modding.

Social cultural aspects of experience, teacher seen as orchestratinglearning experience, first chapter ofFreitasand Maharg, 2011)

There is an attraction of large complex learning environments fornaturalistic, wholistic educational researchersTaylor,2009). This approach is quite fluffy and certainly doesn't suitmeasurable outcomes

Then Whitton / Mosely - potential of games in learning as a widerapplication, especially in HE and a playful approach. Here understandingthe mechanism of the game, are of value, and kind of cracking of thecode. Seeing the value in the game process, and making an informedchoice about games being the most effective way of learning thatspecific material.

Game Makers-----------

Adult preparation for making computer games

There is a distinction between AAA games and more indy game makingcourses. The first would have a more vocational, industry focusedapproach learning a particular tool chain or industry definedspecialism, while the second approach can take a step back and explorewider concepts of game making that transcend particular mediums.

In terms of adult learning, we can look at game making courses to giveget a sense of what the foundational concepts are.

MIT game making course gives overview of key texts that have acommonality to most areas. This would be Salen & Juul,

Some have a more cultural slant. Some more practical.

While most adult courses a primary objective of making real games,(evenif making trash games, indy games), there is a wider set of objectivesfor game making programs for activities for young people.

**Young people's computer game making activities**

I've covered motivations in other writing (do a summary),

Here overlap with the maker movements and diy approaches and alsostraight-forward computing agenda

-   Engineering and design processes-   Understanding of game systems and mechanics-   Programming skills & computational thinking practices
