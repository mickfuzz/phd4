 Constructivism and Complex Learning Environments =================================================

This writing covers the foundations and characteristics ofconstructivism. It also explores its relevance to understanding complexlearning ecologies, such as my study interest of digital game making inintergenerational environments.

Foundations of constructivism-----------------------------

The foundations of constructivism can be usefully contrasted tobehavioural and cognitive learning theories through the lens of theconcept of objectivism. Objectivism in a philosophical context can bedescribed as viewing reality as external to and independent of the humanmindJonassen,1991). Applied to a learning context, the behavioural school uses thisperspective to justify a focus on teacher instruction, with knowledgesuited to direct transmission. Effective learning maximises fidelity tothe original knowledge which should be tested without recourse toexamining the processes of the mind.

From these foundations, a cognitive school of psychology began toexplore mental processes, often using a metaphor of mind as computer.Concepts of information processing, memory and cognitive load becameprevalent. Bruner, a pioneer of the cognitive movement later questionedthe overreliance on computer metaphors and subsequent implications forapplication in education1990).His concern was that the specialisation of cognitivists on theinformation processing of the mind diverted attention from exploring its'meaning-making' capabilities1990,p. 2).

This constructivist focus on meaning-making, encompassing a view ofknowledge as constructed rather than received, marks a philosophicalbreak from an objectivist worldview, one with significant implicationsto the design of learning environmentsJonassen,1991). Characteristics of constructivism are outlined in the followingsection.

Outline of key concepts of constructivism-----------------------------------------

To best explore implications for education of a constructivistperspective, fundamental concepts of the theory should be examined. Thisprocess is made more complex by the varieties of schools ofconstructivism. Palincsar explores a tentative spectrum, with aconstructivism rooted in a social construction of reality at one end anda more individually focused view of the construction of knowledge at theother1998).Phillips proposes a three dimensional model of divergences, extendingthe individual/ social focus to incorporate dimensions of publicknowledge and radical nature of knowledgeconstructionDerry,1996). These concepts are explored in context later in this writing.

Despite this variety, overarching themes of a constructivist view oflearning can be identified. The work of Grabinger and colleagues oncreating rich environments for active learning is instructive in thisaspectGrabingerand Dunlap, 1995; Grabinger et al., 1997).

When describing common features of constructivism, Grabinger and Dunlapidentify three characteristics; knowledge is cumulative and a result ofactive processes, context is used by individuals to personaliseknowledge and the importance of collaboration and social negotiation ofmeaning. These themes are now explored in more depth.

Active nature of knowledge creation

The interrelated concepts of puzzlement, perturbment and disequilibriumare used to explore the active view of knowledge construction prevalentin foundational constructivist theoryDewey,1938; Piaget, 1954; Savery and Duffy, 1995). Piaget described knowledgeas an active process where the learner constructs knowledge usingevolving cognitive structures. Dis-equilibrium occurs when mentalstructures are no longer viable for the learner in response to newexperiences. Piaget described these structures as schemata (singularschema), which can be described as mental frames grouping togetherunderstanding of, and reactions to concepts and situations. Piaget'sunderstanding of schemata can be contrasted to a more inclusivedefinition favoured in information processing / cognitive sciencecircles where a schema is smaller in scope and can comprise a variety ofmemory objects and mental modelsDerry,1996).

Schemata facilitate the processing and storing of information. Whenexperiences processed are experienced as being in 'dis-equilibrium' withexisting schema, there is conflict and a dynamic, restructuring processof accommodation is said to happen, resulting in an updated and morecomplex schema. Experiences not in contradiction with existing schemata,are integrated in a process Piaget described as assimilation. VonGlasefeld highlights the inaccuracy of a view of assimilation as apassive process where schemata are seen as a containers for knowledgevonGlasersfeld, 1998). Instead Piaget's conception of a schema as a'cohesive, repeatable action sequence'1952,p. 240) is emphasised. The concept of viability introduced to clarifythat the restructuring of the schema does not bring the learner closerto an objective reality but one which can be said to be more 'viable'within the learners social contextvonGlasersfeld, 1998, p. 9)

The active process of knowledge creation is also identified by Duffy andSavery who emphasise learner focus on an element of their environment asa key factor of what learning will occurSaveryand Duffy, 1995). They recast Piaget's dis-equilibrium as puzzlement andcite vonGlaserfeld's assertion that the people and environmentsurrounding us provide the greatest source of such perturbationvonGlasersfeld, 1998). The importance of context is explored in the nexttwo sections.

Situated nature of knowledge creation

Constructivism views knowledge as situated, that is, knowledge is mosteffective when linked with specific and authenticcontextsCollinset al., 1988). Brown and colleagues talk of 'inert knowledge'accumulated by learners able to perform , for example, rotetransformations of figures without the ability to use such proceduresusefully in the context from which they are derived1989,p. 33). Inert knowledge can be compared to learning concepts viaauthentic contexts and tools which the authours assert allow a richer,more complex understanding and reproducibility of knowledge. Anindexicalising of knowledge is described, reflecting a complexconstruction of links between context and the contents of mental modelscreated, thus similar contexts are required to allow reapplication orreuse of the learning.

Collaboration and social negotiation of meaning

Context underpins a further strand of constructivism identified byGrabinger, the socially negotiated nature of knowledge and theimportance of collaboration in the process. These concepts are nowbriefly explored through an examination o fthe sociocultural theory ofVygotskyPalincsar,1998).

For Vygotsky the role of context is extended beyond its impact on the(acknowledged) internal construction of knowledge of individual toencompass the joint creation of a cultural context by its participantsColeand Wertsch, 1996). For example, the previously mentioned concept ofviability depends on the existence of a social environment which allowsthe relative testing of such viability. This environment, and itsassociated tools, norms and processes are socially constructed throughon-going negotiation and active participation of its participants.

These tools and processes are referred to as artefacts. The interactionof present and past participants are seen to create historical andcultural artefacts that compose authentic environments and thuspossibility for deep, contextualised learningBrownet al., 1989). The view of tools and symbolic artefacts as mediating thelearning process is key to a constructivist view of higher mentalprocesses, such as language use or problem solvingColeand Wertsch, 1996; Cunningham and Duffy, 1996; Vygotsky, 1978). Thiscontinued co-construction of the learning environment has significantimplications for educational design which are explored in the followingsection.

Application of concepts to educational settings-----------------------------------------------

Constructivist concepts have been evaluated and recombined in a numberof responses and frameworks with the aim of reforming educationalprovision. Many researchers have integrated and evolved aims from thefield Instructional (Systems) Design to create a rich seam of literatureand studies around constructivist learning environments and their thepossibilities offered by emerging tools and technologiesJonassenet al., 1996; Jonassen and Mandl, 1990; Mcmahon, 1997; Wilson, 1996).Other researchers have identified approaches which map underlyingconstructivist concepts to application in digital game playing andmaking communitiesGee,2003; Kafai and Burke, 2015).

Duffy and Cunningham's identify responses to apply a constructivistapproach to the design of educational environments, namely; discoverylearning, zone of proximal development. scaffolding, cognitiveapprenticeship, coaching, learner control, assessment and collaborativelearning1996).I have prioritised the following areas to explore in more detail drawingon the literature base described in the previous paragraph; learnercontrol, context and collaborative learning.

***Maximise ****Learn****er**** Control***

Duffy and Cunningham initially situate the concept of learner control incomputer enhanced instruction where it is contrasted to computer controlof the sequence of information and tasks. Given that autonomy andlearner control pose significant challenges for designers significantlycan this extra work be justified.

Hannafin and Lee identify student autonomy as a key factor in learnermotivation, performance and creativity, as outlined by selfdetermination theoryDeciand Ryan, 2000; Lee and Hannafin, 2016). From them learner autonomy doesnot require participant to have created projects from scratch, they mayhave chosen from a range of predetermined choices, however 'endorsement'of activities is key. Endorsement is described as a shift from anexternal motivated locus of motivation to an internal one on the part ofthe learner. Plainly speaking, the learner doesn't have to havegenerated something to buy in to it.

Wilson characterises constructivist learning environments as opensystems where learner choice is emphasised1995).However, rather than deemphasising the importance of teacher or designerinput, he asserts that this open nature can tend to chaos and eventuallyde-motivation of learners and thus good design is needed for eachcomponent of that system and in the linkages to help maintain learneractivity.

Place Learning in Authentic Contexts

Due to the indexical nature of knowledge and effective recall, learningcontexts should be as close or ideally identical to the target domain ofuse of the skills being learntBrownet al., 1989). For example, Duffy and Savery note a disconnect betweenthe kind of work a scientist does, the nature of operations they performand those required in a science lessonSaveryand Duffy, 1995).

The importance of authentic context presents a challenge to classroombased instruction that many initiatives, including cognitiveapprenticeship and student centred learning (SCL), aim to address.. SCLis family of design strategies which highlight; an emphasis on activelearner research in inquiry-based learning, a focus on simulations anddynamic case-studies of problem-based learning, and the studentgeneration of authentic artefacts or activities in project-basedlearningLeeand Hannafin, 2016)

Duffy and Cunningham are critical of cognitive apprenticeship, acoaching model. While they support its aim of proximity to an authenticcontext, its focus on a unidirectional transmission of skills frommaster to apprentice and is less attractive than a more mutual learningprocess that genuine participation in a community would enableCunninghamand Duffy, 1996; Wenger, 1998).

Grabinger and Dunlap cite the importance of authentic contexts tocontribute to increased student ownership of challenges addressed andthat genuine challenge in team work encourages desireable student'collaboration and negotiation'1995,p. 21).

Gee notes implications for learning surrounding the embodied and thusauthentic context provided by effective digital gamesGee,2003, p. 83). As meanings in video games are grounded in realsituations, participation facilitates the acquisition of complexlanguage and concepts in ways that teaching of inert knowledge does not.

Facilitate Collaborative Learning

Vygotsky asserted that "the social dimension of consciousness isprimary"1979,p. 30). Two resulting concepts of relevance are *scaffolding*, whereinstructional or designed supports facilitate early learning attemptsand secondly *the zone of proximal development* where learners are ableto perform more advanced tasks through peer interaction, must beconsidered to create an effective constructivist learning environment .

Duffy and Savery outline the importance of designing a environments thatallow for support and challenges to participants thinking1995).Facilitating procedures for peer feedback and interaction is key to thischallenge.

Gee outlines concept of 'affinity groups' in games playing cultureswhere group members share an understanding of the symbols and culturalnorms of an area of interest2003,p. 27). The concept of gradually increasing, genuine participation in acommunity of practice provides a framework to explain the process ofmoving from outsider to insider of such a groupLave,1991; Wenger, 1998). Kafai underlines the importance of affinity groupsand communities of practice in reference to game making communities,noting particularly the possibilities for interaction and peer learningthrough over shared digital artefacts and processes in real and onlinecommunitiesKafaiet al., 2016).
