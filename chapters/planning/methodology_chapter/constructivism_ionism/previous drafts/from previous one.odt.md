The foundations of building games through Constructionism=========================================================

[]{#anchor}The key word of constructionism increasing in popularity.Also with game playing and making.

What are underpinning concepts of a constructionist approach to gamemaking.

This writing traces the genesis of the term from in Papert's Mindstorm

then explores the foundations of constructionism in the constructivismof Piaget and the landscape at the time of this formation, linking withfoundational concepts in the contemporary cognitive revolution

Then explores other uses in more contemporary studies to test ofelaborations or deviations of the term

Make this enough of an intro to Papert to justify the journey back to Piaget----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cognitive Foundations---------------------

-   Summary of Piaget's constructivism-   Background of Constructivism-   Key differences in perspective (end with the celebration on concrete    stage)

Ackermann's exploration of the similarities between constructionism andconstructivism places Papert's focus on the way learners identify andaccommodate new information thus creating new internal representationsof the world.

Celebrating the Concrete------------------------

-   Objects to think with-   Bricolage-   Hard and Soft coding approaches.

Papert's interest in the educational value of the production of digitalartefacts as objects drove the creation of the LOGO coding language someassociated physical tools, notably drawing turtles. For this studyPapert's concept of Microworld is of particular interest. Microworldsare designed spaces which act as incubators for certain kinds oflearning. His criteria for Microworlds are that they should giveexamples of the chosen subject learning, bring all needed conceptsinside the Microworld and that there should be footholds for the enduser to put this kind of learning to use with interaction with the worldPapert,1980, p. 126). It must comply to the learning principle that for aconcept to progress beyond making links to your existing knowledge, youmust use it, play with it to find out more and assimilate or accommodateyour findings into your world viewAckermann,2001).

Of particular interest to this study are the concept of soft and hardapproaches to codingPapert,1990). Whereas a hard approach infers a top down perspective mirrored byrecent conceptions of computational thinkingWing,2008), soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner directedconnection with the materials or digital artefacts involved, aconnection evoking Levi Strauss' concept of bricolage1962).

Constructionism and Current Practice------------------------------------

-   Papert's take in Mindstorm / Children's machine

Resnick et al develop the process of designing a software tool tofacilitate a constructivist approach into a framework containing ananalogy to building design2005).Such a tool should have wide walls catering for diverse interests, a lowthreshold to allow for novices with little technical experience and highceilings so learners are not restricted by the technical limits of thecreative environment as their designs become more complex. * *

*I would develop this more if there were a greater word count to discusstheir framework outlined below.\Immediate Feedback: See the result, see the process\Fluid Experimentation: Easy to get started, easy to connect,\Open Exploration: Variety of materials, variety of genres *

Resnick and Rosenbaum also discuss 'tinkering with tinkerability',detailing facilitation guidelines to support the open learningprocesses. These include; set themes not challenges, highlight diverseexamples, tinker with space, encouraging engagement with people, posingquestions instead of giving answers and combining diving in withstepping back2013,pp. 17--19). They identify this as an area for further research.
