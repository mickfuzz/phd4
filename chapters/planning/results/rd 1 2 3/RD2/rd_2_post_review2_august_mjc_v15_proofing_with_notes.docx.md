    1.  Aims of Study          --------------

This study is concerned with the potential benefits of code-based digital game making via project work. The perceived need to teach young people to code and develop digital fluency is fuelled by disparate motivations, including providing talent for STEM and digital creative industries (The Royal Society, 2012), shaping informed and active digital citizens (Williamson, 2016) and a broader empowerment agenda of healthy digital practice educating young people to be producers of technology products rather than mere consumers (Mozilla Foundation, 2012; Sefton-Green, 2013).

In the UK a coalition of industry-focused actors including Microsoft, Nominet, Becta and the British Computing Society have been successful in lobbying to formalise Computer Science education via inclusion in a compulsory curriculum (Williamson, 2016) and the development of new Computing qualifications. However, despite significant government investment in Computing at School hubs (practitioner exchanges), teacher training bursaries and additional co-ordination and teacher resource production, there has been a decrease in IT related GCSE and A-level uptake (Kemp and Berry, 2019). This is due, in part, to the removal of ICT from performance tables (Staufenberg, 2015), schools and pupils being wary that Computing GCSEs are more demanding in comparison to previous ICT qualifications (Brown et al., 2014) and pupil's lack of identification with computing as a subject, particularly for girls (Wong, 2016); only 20% of candidates for Computing GCSE are female (Kemp et al., 2018).

There is potential in pupils making computer games to counter the issues of lack of identification with computing activities, via the leveraging of home interests in game playing (Livingstone and Hope, 2011; The Royal Society, 2017). Wider participation in casual gaming including evidence of a 'steady democratization happening between the sexes' (Fisher and Jenson, 2017, p. 3) mitigate previous accessibility issues in relation to 'gamer' culture (Cassell and Jenkins, 2000; DiSalvo et al., 2009; Kafai et al., 2017); a culture previously seen as the preserve of young, white males (Shaw, 2015). Thus despite ongoing issues of inequalities of gender and race representations within commercial games, making computer games provides a potentially fertile ground to reshape expectations of computing culture (Pelletier, 2008).

The recent coordinated efforts to increase UK mainstream provision in computing have tended to focus on the value of computational thinking (Brown et al., 2014). My concern is that this narrow focus promotes a pedagogically conservative approach that unintentionally reduces learner engagement. This is unfortunate in a context where there are many examples of innovative and engaging practice in computing education -- not only of game making -- but also of accessible creative software, physical computing materials and playful project-based approaches (Anderson et al., 2017; Kafai et al., 2014; Peppler et al., 2016; Tekinbaş et al., 2014; Torres, 2009). More educational designs and research are needed to explore wider learning dimensions in the area of digital game making (Bermingham et al., 2013; Boyle et al., 2016; Waite, 2017).

Involvement in extra curricular activities influences take up of STEM subjects in school (Archer et al., 2013). The removal of the practical restraints of classroom and curriculum allow a greater freedom to develop new approaches (The Royal Society, 2017). The role of family influence on expectations and attitudes to computing can help overcome barriers to participation (Roque, 2016). My research will investigate the inclusion of a broad range of communicative and creative competencies via a creative computing activity and the impact of their development in a family learing context.

The ongoing game making programme that forms the basis for this study has already been run in several iterations of between four to eight weeks of weekly two hour sessions. As part of my role in the EdLab programme of the MMU Faculty of Education I run outreach activities and focus groups which target local home education communities; here game making as an educational activity was highlighted by both parents and children as an area of high interest. Children and parents from home educating families attend sessions in the MMU Brooks building in a classroom with access to laptop computers. Young participants from ages eight to twelve attend with one or two family members who are normally parents or grandparents. Normal course attendance comprises six to ten young people; participants are all invited to make games using online software tools and the end products are text-coded computer games which are playable in web pages.

My study takes a social historical approach to support analysis and development of a playful game making programme in a non-formal environment. I will explore family participation in collaborative digital game making to develop twenty-first century skills. I do this by facilitating the creation of a community of learners undertaking a programme making digital games. I expose, analyse and attempt to resolve tensions in my evolving game making programme and investigate how the goals and culture of participants interact with the tools and potential outcomes of the programme.

Literature Review -----------------

My learning design is a playful project-based approach to web game making using online coding tools in a family setting. This review addresses diverse factors that influence the design of my learning intervention and research. Twenty-first century skills have been widely cited as a potential outcome of digital game making (Bermingham et al., 2013; Morgan, 2015; Pinto and Escudeiro, 2014; Thomas et al., 2011). While there are diverse definitions of twenty-first century skills (Binkley et al., 2012), most encompass configurations of the following concepts: collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, communication, citizenship and digital literacy. However reviews of dimensions of learning in game making (Earp, 2015; Kafai and Burke, 2015) and game modification (Gee and Tran, 2016; Kynigos and Yiannoutsou, 2018) show that these interrelated skills are under-represented in the research in this domain.

To allow the development of the social and systems-related elements of twenty-first century skills, the game making programme has been designed to facilitate participant collaboration and learner choice of activities. As such, the literature review of my thesis will deconstruct foundational elements of collaboration and choice in learning technology from a sociocultural perspective. Key concepts will include scaffolding (Pea, 2004), Zone of Proximal Development (Chaiklin, 2003; Vygotskiĭ, 1986), joint problem spaces (Dillenbourg, 1999; Jordan, 2004; Roschelle and Teasley, 1995) and participation in communities of learning (Rogoff, 1994).

In my study as participants are able to draw on their own understandings and experiences of game playing in a family context to set goals either individually or together with family members. As such, the concept of choice as a factor which increases motivation (Bonk and Cunningham, 2012) and sustained engagement (Blin, 2004; Evans and Boucher, 2015) in an emerging learning environment are significant. As such, my final literature review will contain a critical examination of individual and sociocultural dimensions of the related concepts of agency, autonomy and leaner choice.

While some researchers define formal learning as that which happens in school and informal learning as that outside of school (Gerber et al., 2001), others (Eshach, 2007, p. 173; Werquin, 2009) would describe an intervention like the one in this study -- where learning happens outside of formal institution and where there is little instruction but the learner experience is carefully planned -- using the term 'non-formal' in contrast to both formal and unstructured/informal learning. Sefton-Green (2004) complicates this view, noting that informal learning can take place in formal settings and vice-versa. Given this inconsistency, my study will use research and relevant literature to create working definitions of such terms. Research exploring home game playing and digital activity uncovers material that families may bring into a non-formal game making process; I will draw on work on participatory culture (Jenkins, 2009), affinity spaces (Gee, 2004a) and naturalistic studies of digital use and creativity in the home (Itō et al., 2010; Livingstone et al., 2018). Gee's (2004b) work on games and associated culture as learning experiences is founded on his understanding of how they engender a shared discourse and emerging identities . My study will be guided by understandings of how home discourses or 'funds of knowledge' (Moje et al., 2004; Moll et al., 1992, p. 3) can be drawn on as a resource by participants to facilitate learning in new environments.

Studies which explore making and playing games together as a family are scarce however two pieces of research are of note in this domain especially in their exploration of family cultures impact on playful learning experiences (Roque et al., 2016; Siyahhan et al., 2010). Siyahhan and colleagues (2010) found that parental expectations of what successful participation in a collaborative role playing game looked like were shaped by their own experiences and preferences in the way they played games. Roque (2016) led a programme called Family Creative Learning which employed structured debriefing stages before each creative session drawing on a framework of helping roles for parents around technology work (Barron et al., 2009) to praise and thus re-inforce emerging patterns of behaviour. The value of a structured and supported reflection is in line with project based approaches to learning (Bell, 2010; Thomas, 2000); here learning incorporates goal setting amd collaborative working practices and is thus suited to the development of twenty-first century skills.

Increased research on video games and learning has also shed light on how gameful and playful elements can be applied to wider learning experiences (Gee, 2004a). The literature is strong supporting the use of playful approaches to project-based work to build literacy and authentic language use (Cremin et al., 2006; Grainger et al., 2003). The role of playful approaches and authentic contexts to reduce anxiety in language acquisition is also well documented (Krashen, 1982; Young, 1992). Drawing on a lineage of the value of process drama to develop language use, Heathcote and Bolton (1994) are convincing in their advocacy of an approach called the Mantle of the Expert. Here participants adopt productive roles in a fictional community -- often a workplace -- scenario and undertake activities such as writing or design in role. More recently, Brookes and Moseley (2012, p. 95) identify the potential of playful game-like interventions (e.g. alternative reality games) to bridge a 'reality gap' between simulations and authentic experience. I have undertaken research with colleagues in the MMU Drama teacher training department (Patterson et al., 2019) which transposes the drama process of *writing in role* to become *coding in role,* thus exploring the potential of drama scenarios to reduce learner anxiety surrounding unfamiliar technical processes. However, despite the potential highlighted by Michael Anderson (2014) for drama to explore the complexity and contradictions of 'post-normal' society and the role technological innovation and networked systems play, there is little work exploring the potential of the use of a role play and other playful approaches in teaching coding and the associated complexities of digital participation.

While the space limitation of this writing prevents a fuller view of research on game making as an educational activity, in my thesis I will build on existing reviews of game making (Earp, 2015; Gee and Tran, 2016; Hayes and Games, 2008; Kafai and Burke, 2015) to explore underlying issues in research categorised by broad educational motivations; these are the deep learning of subject content, learning computer coding, promoting wider access to technology (particularly for girls), and finally game making to facilitate twenty-first century skills. While these reviews of game making studies differ in their approach to categorisation of the resultant learning outcomes, they are in agreement that while studies exist which explore the potential of game making to develop skills in communication, collaboration and meta-cognition, they are scarce and often lacking in depth compared to those development computing concepts and other areas of subject knowledge. Kafai and Burke (2015, p. 322) express a concern that this lack of detailed focus on these social dimensions of learning compared to 'academic content and technical skill' is due to 'researcher's attempts to legitimize game making as worthy of schools' attention'. Earp and colleagues note key gaps in the research of what they term Learning Digital Game Building (LDGB). Specifically they note that while many studies have focused on motivational factors, there is little research on than development of twenty-first century skills. They highlight a lack of methods to assess learning processes and outcomes, but point to the work of Resnick and Brennan (2012) as an exception. Brennan and Resnick explore potential learning outcomes for Scratch creative computing software users through a detailed and grounded study using illustrative examples from the Scratch community. The authors propose three dimensions of computational thinking, namely computational concepts, computational practices and computational perspectives. While I am in agreement with the usefulness of the approach of examining broader principles of learning dimensions within a more specific context, I am wary of the danger of 'exceptionalist' (Sefton-Green, 2013, p. 8) and potentially unrepresentative claims which a purely case study approach can provoke. I am in agreement with Sefton-Green that such claims seem rife in the area of learning technology which echo those of Earp and colleagues (2013) for more rigorous methods to identify learning outcomes.

Bevan and colleagues (2015; 2013) explicitly examine social elements of learning happening for participants in a context of hands-ons, construction-based, exhibits -- which they term tinkering -- in STEM museums. Joint analysis of video recordings by researchers and domain practitioners resulted in created complementary frameworks which address both the factors considered in the design of interventions and the resulting learning that occurs. The resulting learning dimensions framework identifies four learning categories: engagement, initiative and intentionality, social scaffolding and dimensions of understanding. The authors position this work as a response to those sceptical as to the educational value of such open-ended activities where there is no formal testing and expressions of knowledge understandings and creative processes are fleeting. In the next section I outline a methodology which draws on this systematic use of video recordings to potentially create similar outputs.

Methodology and Methods -----------------------

This section will outline the methodology and methods of my study and explain why they are consistent with my research questions, which are;

-   What methods currently exist to facilitate collaborative learning in     > non-formal digital making environments?

-   What factors should be considered when designing for learner choice     > and collaboration in digital game making environments?

-   What effect does family involvement have on the potential for     > collaborative pedagogical approaches to digital game making?

-   What effect does a pedagogical model focused on learner choice have     > on parent and child learner experiences of digital game making ?

The first question will be addressed by the literature review of my thesis. In my emerging literature review here I have outlined the gaps in current research which will be explored by the subsequent questions. The focus of this study is on the construction of shared meaning and practices as part of an emerging community of game makers. A key gap identified by Earp and colleagues (2013) concerned a lack of suitable methods to identify and evaluate sociocultural dimensions of learning happening in game making activities. To explore the underlying approach of this study, this section explores other methodologies of value (e.g. constructivism, constructionism and naturalistic approaches) before outlining key characteristics and advantages of a sociocultural approach and specifically Activity Theory (AT) as analytical framework.

Cobb (1994) identifies two broad schools of constructivism, one focusing more on individual cognitive processes following the work of Piaget and another drawing on the academic lineage of Vygotsky locating knowledge formation as a cultural activity. Much of the foundational literature on game making focuses on personal dimensions of learning (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996). This body of research draws on Papert's constructionist approach which extends a piagetian perspective to propose that construction of personal knowledge happens best when learners can experiment with and manipulate objects (Ackermann, 2001). Such a focus on individual learning is problematic from perspective of sociocultural approaches due to the potential to ignore both contextual factors influencing the learning setting and the evolving use of resources, processes and shared understandings by emergent communities of learners (O'loughlin, 1992). Some of the specifics of these social processes are outlined in the section above looking at collaboration. Other concepts of value include Vygotsky's concept of mediated action (Wertsch, 1994); Rogoff's take on guided participation within a community of learners (1993) and more detailed analysis of roles community-based transfer of knowledge in practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991).

While noting the limits of an individualist approach of many studies from constructionist researchers, it is important not to dismiss the value of this lineage of research. More recently, Kafai and Burke (2015) identify broader social approaches and attempt to bring them into the constructionist fold. They draw on the framing of Rogoff (1993) of personal, social and community learning planes and advocate the wide-ranging benefits of *constructionist gaming* in these dimensions. While I am broadly in agreement with Pea (1993, p. 65) who notes constructionism lack of an underlying conceptual framework which can describe the impact of the '(learning) designer's interventions' and the 'artefact based intelligence' (the resulting affordances of the designed materials), I do not share his implication that such concerns are unseen by constructionist researchers. Indeed work by Resnick and colleagues is explicit in exploring the affordances of designed software and hardware construction kits (Brennan and Resnick, 2013; Resnick et al., 2005; 2013; Resnick and Silverman, 2005).

Beyond this concern with materials, my study also seeks to address cultural factors which may hinder or facilitate participation in digital making. As such it requires a method of research which allows the detailed description and evaluation of complex, emergent learning environments. While other suitable methodological approaches exist including participatory design (Muller, 2007), ethnography and guided participation, (Rogoff et al., 1993), communities of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991), mutual appropriation and design experiments (Engeström, 2011; Nicolopoulou and Cole, 2009), I have chosen Activity Theory (AT) for this study. The following section will justify this choice and give a necessarily brief summary of key components of Engestrom's presentation of AT (1999). The foundational unit of analysis of AT is an activity system made up of -- painted in broad brushstrokes -- participants, their goals, the tools they use, their peers, the ways they interact and the norms of this community. AT when used to analyse a learning environment allows researchers to shift between various perspectives including an individual focus, family focus and a wider group focus (Engeström, 1987). This ability to identify and compare interacting activity systems of varying size is vital to capture to the complex design and holistic approach of my game making programme. In alignment with sociocultural approaches, AT allows the recognition of my own active involvement with the process. It will allow me to explore my own shifting and multiple objectives as a researcher, facilitator and participant in the community of game makers.

Expansive learning as an application of AT which highlights issues of interaction with tools and the processes of development of a learning community over time, is of particular use to my study. The use of a structured, cyclical design model facilitates analysis of changes in working and learning environments. As an example, this approach can militate the tendency of implementation of new technology focused initiatives to fail due to extended planning stages being to far removed from end users or learners (Engeström, 2001). We can contrast expansive learning with design-based research (Engeström, 2011; Sannino et al., 2016). While both note the value of iteration in experimental design, an expansive approach takes in to account a mutual influence on the evolution of the experimental design from both researchers and participants. As I will explore in the following section, my study has proved to be suitable to an iterative approach with input from participants into the evolving learning design and resources used. While there is a relatively limited scope for large shifts of culture due to the relatively short exposure times and length of participant involvement, there is a relatively high degree of authenticity of tasks. This is relevant as this study my be able to draw on methods which are more commonly applied to workplace research.

The emergent nature of the process of project implementation in expansive learning is mirrored in the evolving nature of the AT itself. The status of AT as a static, consistent set of methods is contested not only by critics who highlight fragmented applications or different variants of AT (Bakhurst, 2009), but also by proponents who highlight the evolving nature of the AT as an important and desirable inherent characteristic (Engeström, 1999; Somekh and Nissen, 2011). While I do not want to create a new iteration of activity theory I believe that the process of applying it to the field of game making via text code in a family environment may yield interesting methodological results as well as domain specific knowledge.

**Data Gathering and Analysis**

My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer, participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. I also record the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants. One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour.

I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies (Derry et al., 2010). I will use a variant of discourse analysis to explore interactions of participants captured on video recordings. Mercer and colleagues identify discourse analysis as a loose associations of methods to support linguistic analysis of interactions to identify emergent patterns (Mercer et al., 2004). While a common pattern in classroom interactions is that of IRF, initiation (teacher), response (student) and follow up (teacher) (Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975), the inherent assumption that a teacher will be leading an activity will not consistently be appropriate for my study; although at times a parent may take this role. Other discourse analysis frameworks that take a sociocultural approach (Lyle, 1993; Phillips, 1985), and specifically those from project focused studies (Hmelo-Silver and Barrows, 2008; Moje et al., 2001), may be of greater use to allow more detailed treatment of the incorporation of tools and cultural artefacts into a collective discourse. To avoid distraction from AT as my principle analytical framework I am in agreement with Wells (1999, p. 172) who proposes the use of AT's concepts to situate 'spoken discourse \... as one, but only one, of the semiotic tools that participants use to achieve the goals of action'. Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals.

My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use and other relevant interests. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music. AT allows an exploration these diverse sources of information as mediating artefacts which are the enabler and product of the shifting goals and outcomes of the programmes participants.

While the rich set of data invites the cross referencing of the many sources, it also presents challenge on how to deal effectively with the large amounts of data being gathered. The use of a 360 camera reduces the amount of live video footage of interactions needed. Instead of multiple cameras pointed in different directions to capture participant interaction, participants are arranged in a square pointing inwards towards a central 360 degree camera. When triangulating data from various sources, I will prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes. A key strategy of AT used to locate learning happening in an environment, is via the identification of contradictions between different elements of the activity systems and subsequent study of how these contradictions are resolved (Engeström and Sannino, 2010). I plan to use my journal and participant interviews to identify key moments of contradictions and resolution to study in greater detail using the range of data available. I am also inspired by the work of Oliver and Pelletier (2006)who employed contradictions between systemic elements to create a coding scheme used to interpret video data in a study on game based learning.

Work Already Undertaken -----------------------

I have carried out three stages of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline activities that have taken place at each stage of activity and include some early results.

The first phase of delivery in late 2018 was based on initial research stage; I drew on literature to identify factors to consider when designing for collaboration. I adopted an open project based approach which integrated drama games to aid group bonding and reflection. I chose a tool set which drew on relevant design principles explored earlier (Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013). The tools allow participants to create games using a combination of a free to use online tools. They comprise a coding environment using the phaser javascript game library (glitch.com), a pixel art editor (piskelapp.com), and a sound effect generator (sfbgames.com/chiptone). One of the principles that I prioritised in the choice of tools was that of immediate feedback for participants. For example, in the code editing interface of glitch.com shown in Illustration 1, changes made to the code on the left section take immediate effect in the resultant game on the right side of the screen.

In terms of supporting resources, stage one was exploratory and responsive; I had no pre-existing supporting materials and created a starting code framework of a platform game and code examples to add extra functionality to the game as the programme developed. At the end of this stage participants showed their games to students in the foyer of the MMU Brooks building and gave me feedback on their participation in the programme.

The second phase in early 2019 drew on this participant feedback and detailed reading of relevant literature to bring substantial changes to the programme. While still driven by participant interests, it took a more structured approach. The resources included small scale starting challenges as A5 hand-outs, step-by-step tutorials as book chapters, and code examples as online projects illustrating key additions to the game. I have brought the workshops resources together a book published on the FLOSS Manuals documentation platform (Chesterman, 2019) and an online project-hub linking to all resources (Chesterman and Potts, 2019). I also carried out four video-recorded interviews with practioners who work with creative methods and technology with young people or families. Early analysis of these interviews has helped shape the evolving design of my programme and has brought into focus key areas of interest already identified in journal entries.

In the third iteration in May 2019 I drew on previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department (Patterson et al., 2019) to create a simple drama process to give a simple external motivation and narrative to the creation of games for a fictional audience of visiting aliens. I also began the data gathering process. I recorded all interactions via use of 360 camera and screen capture of workstations and undertook post-course interviews with participants. Work on analysis of this data is contained in early results section below.

**Early results**

Pictures of the three key activity systems are followed by an additional short commentary.

This representation of different sized systems as units of analysis allows for comparison of the different objectives and outcomes. At times these may be shared between participants, at times in conflict. Example interviews with participants showed overlaps and divergence between young people's motivations (to have fun, work with others together, 'learn how to make hard games,' create art), those of parents (create opportunities to learn coding and gain digital skills, 'understand my child's world of games', build collaboration and teamwork skills) and those of the facilitators (create opportunities for collaborative problem solving and media creation between participants, build meta-cognition of participants and roles as peer supporters). I have already started analysis of journal entries and parent and child discourse and wider interactions from the screen capture data. The following areas of interest are emerging.

**Early contradictions between my goals and those of families**

Initial feedback from participants on stage one showed tensions between my initial desire for a minimally-guided project approach in team groups consisting of three families -- which I believed would maximise personally meaningful goal setting and collaborative work -- and the experience of participants. While participants enjoyed the playful, and flexible approach to learning, they requested more structure and supporting resources. While many appreciated the social nature of the course they found working as a large group problematic at times. Specifically they identified a tendency for the younger participants to focus on making pixel art game elements while parents felt a responsibility to drive coding work. Some parents found coordinating group work stressful particularly in the light of their unfamiliarity with the coding tools and processes. One parent with experience of arts studio practice pointed to a need to have more hands-on time working with the tools before engaging with creative group work.

Subsequently, when more resources were in place, I observed the leveraging of programme tools and resources by parents. I was struck how the printed and online resources designed to support the technical process of game making were used at times by parents to refocus young people on tasks. One iteration of the programme used a narrative device of designing a game for an alien audience. Informal workshop evaluation and interview data shows that this device was embraced not only by young people who enjoyed a surreal and playful elements, but also by parents who used the urgency and direction of the fiction to redirect the attention of young people towards goals which they values such as trying to integrate new coding elements or to work more collaboratively. The intervention seemed successful to resolve some of the tensions present due to their divergent goals.

**Tensions and resolutions related to programme goals and family culture **

As previously mentioned, there are often significant cultural barriers to computer coding (Wong, 2016). While early results indicate that for some young people parental involvement in shaping a positive attitude to the programme and persist in undertaking challenging activities, the accompanying challenge of overcoming parental fear of text coding is also apparent. There is also a complexity in conflicting reactions of young people which at times seek to exclude parents from involvement in their game making favouring peer interaction at times and whilst returning for parental approval at others. Media literacy and digital fluency, much more than computational thinking and competency while not a core part of my goals but it emerged as a significant outcomes of pilot studies. Interestingly the remembering of passwords, specific administration processes for webtool use and other aspects of fluency were often delegated to other family members. I am interested in this emerging social dimension of the operationalising -- in the sense of making routine -- of such processes (Leont'ev, 1974).

**Tensions related to community norms, tools and participant goals**

A significant conflict exists between programme tools which promote a social approach to learning, and the individual desire for control over the game making environment. A revision of programme design which allowed participants to self select working grouping led to greater individual and parental pair working. Participants were motivated by their full control over the incorporation of graphical and audio elements and ability to make changes in code and see the effects immediately. This has prompted further adaptations in the learning design which allow for this retention of control, which encourage learners to experiment with multiple pathways but which also promote shared creation of meaning in collaborative activities. Additionally, I identified a tension that excessive fragmentation of the activities undertaken -- driven by the motivating factor of learner choice -- could decrease the ability of participants to learn from each other. My journal entries document my thinking of the role of resources which evolved from a step-by-step guide to a dual approach which encouraged diverse learner pathways stemming from a shared framework and complementary instruction-based resources. Some parent-child pairs worked through the structured foundation on coding structures and concepts at home and found this supported their more exploratory work in sessions well.

**Observations on frustrations from coding errors**

A simple tension for all participants is that of not being able to achieve goals due to coding errors. While the concept of learning from failure is well worn, the demotivating effect of mistakes that appear impenetrable to solution was both palpable and time consuming to address. In our context of the glitch.com web coding tool, code syntax errors would often result in a blank white screen. As a counterpoint to this kind of blank screen error were *glitches*. Here the result often retains a recognisable link to the intended effect, but with some unexpected behavior or characteristic. The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce these glitches and their unintended effects in game play. For example when adding a new enemy a glitch would be that they enemy did not zap a player in the way it was intended to. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful.

Next Steps  -----------

As per the timeline of my RD1 I will continue to iterate the design of the programme and record data as detailed above during the next academic year 2019-2020. There is one alteration; development and revision of the programme is happening concurrently to programme delivery via response to in-session feedback and participant interviews rather than separate design sessions outlined in the original.

While, data from in-depth interviews, in-situ observations and conversations with participants have proven to be a extremely rich source of material for revisions to the design, much of this has been on an ad-hoc basis. Two attempts at more to gather design suggestions outside of the making context were less successful. My impression is that participants lacked the language and confidence to fully participate. As such, I will create activities to develop the co-design faculties of participants and to integrate more feedback processes into each session to bring the process more inline with an expansive learning principles outlined in the methodology section.

I will work with university colleagues to further develop a drama process incorporating playful ways to increase a feeling of authenticity within project work. I will incorporate more elements of the Mantle of the Expert approach (Heathcote and Herbert, 1985), specifically in the way in which participants are given challenges to allow them to inhabit the decision-making processes of professionals. My goal here is to facilitate more opportunities for reflection and collaboration between participants.

My work on supporting resources in the form of a starting game code framework, tutorials and supporting code examples, which had been in active development in previous iterations of workshop delivery, has now stabilised. This stability will allow me to give a greater focus to studying the way parents and young people interact with these resources to achieve personal and group goals. I have previously noted parents use of resources to redirect young people's attention to their goals; I am now particularly interested in the way young people demonstrate evidence of their initial goal setting and revision of aims through their interaction with these resources.

In terms of data analysis, my next challenge is the triangulation of the diverse data gathered around critical moments of participant experience. Based on the foundational literature explored above and my journal entries I will evolve a coding structure for workshop and participant interview recordings structured around AT and discourse analysis. I will use the software package NVivo to record and code research data from key moments of interactions and participant interviews.
