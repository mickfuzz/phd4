Aims of Study  --------------

Context and Need

-   Coding and digital fluency increasingly required (including STEM and     beyond) and access gaps exist -   UK response to formalise CS education in curriculum, but resulted in     decreased IT provision -   Potential identified in RS report to use game making projects to     teach computing -   Potential offered by engagement at home in game playing, to motivate     game making as educational activity. -   Digital Making via project work has benefits beyond inequality of     access to STEM pipeline, 21C skills, and the media literacy needed     to be engaged citizens -   More educational designs / project programmes need to be developed     to support development of 21C skills. I propose a good way to do     this is via expansive learning in non-formal environments, expose,     analyse and resolve design tensions, before scaling to formal     environments.

B**road approach**

Research Questions and changes

-   What methods currently exist to facilitate collaborative learning in     non-formal digital making environments? -   What factors should be considered when designing for learner choice     and collaboration in digital game making environments? -   What effect does family involvement have on the potential for     collaborative pedagogical approaches to digital game making? -   What effect does a pedagogical model focused on collaborative design     and learner choice have on parent and child learner experiences of     digital game making ? -   How do new technologies allow experimental processes to capture and     analyse data to study collaborative learning in a complex     environment?

Summary of changes:

-   Two questions are dropped which will be covered by other questions,     specifically the family nature of the project is not a primary     focus, and the question on methods. -   One question is added which is the additional focus on the process     of designing for learner choice and collaboration as the novel     learning design has generated extensive notebook material based on     intersection of theory and practice.

It maps out the research concerns under investigation in the field, as gleaned from a dataset of almost 500 publications of different types specifically dedicated to the topic. The review forms part of the author's research activities in game making for learning carried out with an EC co-funded project called MAGICAL (Making Games in Collaboration for Learning).

We found that the majority of studies focused on teaching coding and academic content through game making, and that few studies explicitly examined the roles of collaboration and identity in the game making process. We argue that future discussions of serious gaming ought to be more inclusive of constructionist approaches to realize the full potential of serious gaming. Making games, we contend, not only more genuinely introduces children to a range of technical skills but also better connects them to each other, addressing the persistent issues of access and diversity present in traditional digital gaming cultures.","DOI":"10.1080/00461520.2015.1124022","ISSN":"0046-1520","note":"PMID: 27019536\nPMCID: PMC4784508","shortTitle":"Constructionist Gaming","journalAbbreviation":"Educ Psychol","author":[{"family":"Kafai","given":"Yasmin B."},{"family":"Burke","given":"Quinn"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]}},"label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDJSe8eAxdnd}(Earp,     2015; Kafai and Burke, 2015), find some personal dimensions are     relatively well established, (computing knowledge, subject     knowledge), social skills including communication and collaboration     are less researched, and cultural-historical perspectives barely     mentioned. -   As such, this literature review widened to include broader contexts     of digital making, an informal STEM making and tinkering.

However, educational games are often limited in scope to the topic of the game itself and position learners as 'players' in the game space, rather than giving them control over the gaming environment. In fact, the increasing body of research literature suggests that making games could better address the needs of learners than just playing existing learning games. Collaborative game-making provides a model in which learners can work together to create something that is meaningful for them, giving them input into both the process and product, and facilitating the development of a range of 21CS (21CS), such as digital literacy. Intuitive digital game-making tools have become increasingly available in recent years, allowing students to directly access game-making environments and support the growth in use of collaborative game-making learning activities in schools. Making Games in Collaboration for Learning (MAGICAL) is an EU-funded project that aims to explore the use of collaborative game-making as a pedagogic model. It seeks to establish whether, and in what ways, the approach can support collaboration, problem-solving, creativity and digital literacy skills. This paper starts by considering the literature on digital game-making, particularly highlighting the benefits, drawbacks and research gaps. It then goes on to describe the MAGICAL project in more detail, particularly focusing on the way in which the 21CS can be defined, communicated to learners, and assessed. Next, the different approaches to collaborative game-making in the classroom are discussed. The paper concludes by highlighting lessons learned from the project so far, and presenting recommendations for collaborative game-making in the classroom.","author":[{"family":"Bermingham","given":"Sue"},{"family":"Charlier","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Dagnino","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Duggan","given":"James"},{"family":"Earp","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Kiili","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Luts","given":"Evelien"},{"family":"Whitton","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Stock","given":"Lien"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10,3]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDM3yKBDas3K}(Bermingham     et al., 2013). -   This study narrows the focus to collaboration and decision making. -   Collaboration around projects and problems can broken down further     from wide participation to a narrow joint focus on *Joint Problem     Spaces*     []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"J83tcokp","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Dillenbourg, 1999; Jordan, 2004; Roschelle and Teasley, 1995)","plainCitation":"(Dillenbourg, 1999; Jordan, 2004; Roschelle and Teasley, 1995)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":6527,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/Z3K75XH2"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/Z3K75XH2"],"itemData":{"id":6527,"type":"chapter","title":"What do you mean by collaborative learning?","container-title":"Collaborative- learning: Cognitive and Computational Approaches","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher-place":"Oxford","page":"pp.1-19","source":"Zotero","event-place":"Oxford","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Dillenbourg","given":"Pierre"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]}},"label":"page"},{"id":7068,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/M39J295K"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/M39J295K"],"itemData":{"id":7068,"type":"chapter","title":"Scaffolding learning and co-constructing understandings","container-title":"Early childhood education: Society and culture","page":"31–42","author":[{"family":"Jordan","given":"Barbara"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]}},"label":"page"},{"id":6536,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/7PPJ9ZS4"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/7PPJ9ZS4"],"itemData":{"id":6536,"type":"chapter","title":"The Construction of Shared Knowledge in Collaborative Problem Solving","container-title":"Computer Supported Collaborative Learning","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","page":"69-97","source":"Crossref","event-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","abstract":"This paper focuses on the processes involved in collaboration using a microanalysis of one dyad's work with a computer-based environment (the Envisioning Machine).

Concepts important to educational settings for choice and collaboration

**WHY - **Outline concepts of choice and collaboration from different schools cognitive background and more ecological background. Coming from more social naturalistic however, cognitive school useful as more interventionist by nature, which helps my intervention -- I'll bring them together at end.

-   Roschelle and Teasley (1995) also talk of the importance of     negotiated meanings and repairs in understandings in analysis of     dyad problem solving . Compare 'repairs' in meaning in R and T /     Dillenbourg, to conflicts and tensions in AT. -   From this I propose, collaboration in problems solving is more     realistic when choice is present and therefore genuine negotiation     can take place.

**LINK --** Ultimately, while this section is on social approaches and factors to learning, there is tension surrounding conceptions of personal learning that must be addressed. The focus of this study is on language use, shared meaning and learning of digital making and coding practices. These are processes that the individual is involved in learning. Contrast constructivist notion of personal learning as transmission with that of Rogoff's understanding of appropriation of practices in-situ.

If practices need to be studied in context then the conventions, tools and concepts of different elements of my design are important to explore in enough depth for a non-expert reader to understand.

In short     informal is without structure (e.g. Communities of Practice),     non-formal is structured but out of formal settings (e.g ) .

This study assumes no specialised knowledge of these areas thus relevant contextual factors to outline are:

-   background experience of digital game playing, and wider discorses     that family bring to the process -   characteristics of non-formal, third space learning (contrasted with     formal and totally unstructured learing) -   value of project-based approaches and playful elements like ARGs and     Mantle of Expert -   game making and modding as an educational practices, particularly in     non-formal settings, -   characteristics of code playgrounds as an educational tool for     coding and multimedia remixing

**\ LINK** - I have selected contextual factors which have informed my choice of design, which will impact on or which have potential to illuminate the analysis of results. For some of these sections, eg - family, game making, it is clear why an overview of research concepts is needed, for others -- including playful project approaches and collaborative production in playgrounds -- my justification fro in will be explored.

Concepts here normally emerge from empirical studies, however there is not space to go into detail, inclusion here indicates that I think they are valid unless otherwise stated.

Family, Professional Contexts & Media Literacy

-   From earlier ecological approach to research and our understandings     of the learning happening from Rogoff, for this study wider     ecologies of interest are digital family learning in the home, retro     game playing and wider game making communities of indy games.     Livingstone here? -   Media literacy studies, Burn, Gee, Jenkins, a wide spectrum of     digital fluency. Gee's affinity spaces could be seen as non-formal,     as designed spaces compared to more chaotic Participatory Culture

Research on the domestication of media technology is drawn on to examine the social impulses and conditions under which family-centred video gaming is introduced in the home as a domestic leisure activity. In response to parental anxieties about children’s disengagement from family life through new media use, industry-led claims that video gaming can foster family harmony are appealing. Representations of family gaming in the Wii commercials are analysed in relation to the findings of recent independent surveys on emerging patterns of gaming between parents and children. Policy issues emerge about the potential social and educational benefits of family-centred gaming and assumptions about them made in surveys and government-commissioned reports. Important questions are raised about the family dynamics of video gaming and children’s potential to benefit from this family-centred media entertainment in diverse family contexts.","DOI":"10.1080/02614367.2011.568065","ISSN":"0261-4367","shortTitle":"‘Wii play as a family’","author":[{"family":"Chambers","given":"Deborah"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,1]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDyR4XCss5HK}(Chambers,     2012). video game play seen as positive for communication bringing     families closer together     []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"6haptZ6K","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(It\\uc0\\u333{} et al., 2010)","plainCitation":"(Itō et al., 2010)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":3072,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/URKI7FTD"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/URKI7FTD"],"itemData":{"id":3072,"type":"book","title":"Hanging out, messing around, and geeking out: kids living and learning with new media","collection-title":"The John D. and Catherine T.

In this paper we analyze the instructional potentials of learner-controlled hypermedia environments as well as possible reasons for the ambiguous results of studies that have aimed at determining the effectiveness of hypermedia learning. According to our analysis, the potential effectiveness of self-controlled learning with hypermedia might be difficult to demonstrate due to (1) usability problems (i.e., disorientation, distraction, cognitive overload), (2) moderating learner characteristics (i.e., prior knowledge, self-regulatory skills, cognitive styles, and attitudes towards learning), (3) a lack of conceptual foundations, and (4) methodological shortcomings of many hypermedia studies.

Playful Project Approaches

-   Summary of Project based approaches, especially in relation to     collaboration and autonomy. -   Informal design lends to soft rather than hard scaffolding, however     there are approaches used in non-formal settings which have harder     scaffolding like Mantle of the Expert, or ARG (Whitton Mossley)     (Heathcote) -   **WHY?** -- These elements narrow the gap of an educational     intervention and genuinely authentic contexts. In this case     providing scaffolding tools for participants to engage in dialogue.

In this paper, we discuss how constructionist approaches can inform and benefit the cultivation of computational thinking by exploring the case of modifying and sharing digital games. In this context game modding is implemented as a constructionist activity that enables students' progressive engagement in computational thinking through their interaction with various affordances such as coding, data processors, graphics editors, etc. To further investigate this approach, we present the results of a design-based research in which junior-high school students modified games with the digital tool ChoiCo. ChoiCo (Choices with Consequences) in an online platform that integrates three different affordances for designing and modding digital games: a map-based (GIS) game scene, a simplified database and block-based programming editors.

Children’s participation in the design of learning technologies is a difficult challenge to address, due to limitations in children’s domain-knowledge around which these technologies are developed. Their role in the design process is thus usually limited to that of a user or tester. In this paper we discuss the role of children as “hackers” of what we call ‘half-baked’ games. By hacking a pedagogically engineered half-baked game in order to improve or change it, children are expected to challenge the values, the mechanics and the rules of a fully functioning, but faulty, or inappropriate game originally designed to provoke students to modify it. This discussion uses an example of children modding such a game provocatively called ‘PerfectVille’, which was specially designed to raise problems around the issue of urban sustainability. The game itself was designed with the use of a GIS rule-based authoring tool for game design called ‘sus-x’. The children grappled with both value-laden issues and concepts embedded in the tool they used. The issue of taking children’s values into account but also of helping them to build understandings of wider contested societal values can be addressed by studying the process by which children design and change games affording such experiences. It also illuminated their own perspective and values, which they embedded in the games.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212868916300861","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijcci.2018.04.001","ISSN":"2212-8689","shortTitle":"Children challenging the design of half-baked games","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction","author":[{"family":"Kynigos","given":"Chronis"},{"family":"Yiannoutsou","given":"Nikoleta"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,21]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,18]]}},"label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDlpcOLl3jcB}(Gee     and Tran, 2016; Grizioti and Kynigos, 2018; Kynigos and     Yiannoutsou, 2018) -   Remixing as practice rather than the abstract, professional     reference of plumbing rather than architecting, and then concrete vs     abstract approaches     []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"Nt1LVh4H","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Papert and Turkle, 1990)","plainCitation":"(Papert and Turkle, 1990)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":3905,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/PN46846P"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/PN46846P"],"itemData":{"id":3905,"type":"article-journal","title":"Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete","container-title":"Signs","volume":"16","issue":"1","URL":"http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html","author":[{"family":"Papert","given":"Seymour"},{"family":"Turkle","given":"Sherry"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1990"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,1]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDGWMdMDH2BI}(Papert     and Turkle, 1990).

We find that people make a surprisingly rich set of social inferences from the networked activity information in GitHub, such as inferring someone else's technical goals and vision when they edit code, or guessing which of several similar projects has the best chance of thriving in the long term. Users combine these inferences into effective strategies for coordinating work, advancing technical skills and managing their reputation.","URL":"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2145204.2145396","DOI":"10.1145/2145204.2145396","ISBN":"978-1-4503-1086-4","shortTitle":"Social Coding in GitHub","author":[{"family":"Dabbish","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Stuart","given":"Colleen"},{"family":"Tsay","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Herbsleb","given":"Jim"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,18]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDj6UisZNcx7}(Dabbish     et al., 2012)., and emergent use of git for collaboration and     version control in education     []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"vWCCpg7F","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Zagalsky et al., 2015)","plainCitation":"(Zagalsky et al., 2015)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":6811,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/3MHI86M8"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/3MHI86M8"],"itemData":{"id":6811,"type":"paper-conference","title":"The Emergence of GitHub As a Collaborative Platform for Education","container-title":"Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing","collection-title":"CSCW '15","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","page":"1906–1917","source":"ACM Digital Library","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","abstract":"The software development community has embraced GitHub as an essential platform for managing their software projects.

But if they are to contribute to a rapidly changing and complex global society, they need to understand how digital technologies work. Young people need the skills of content creation, collaboration and communication so they can use digital technologies to solve problems and express themselves. Digital making is the creative process of making a product or digital artefact - from websites, apps, games, and 3D animations to physical objects driven by microcontrollers. Digital making will often mean using coding and programming skills as well as the creative use of digital tools to make new products. Digital making skills are fundamentally underpinned by an understanding of computational thinking but may also include things like creative teamwork, problem solving, engineering and design in order to build new technologies. However, the role of digital technology for learning and the place of making all come with different (often competing) traditions and educational practices. As such, understanding how we best support young people as digital makers is a complex challenge and one which requires careful consideration – something this report sets out to do. As we continue to work with partners such as Nesta and Mozilla to support a generation of digital makers, I look forward to your comments and hope we can work together to address the issues set out in this document. - See more at: http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/knowledge-centre/articles/mapping-digital-makers#sthash.RUEzvur5.dpuf","URL":"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/","shortTitle":"Mapping digital makers","author":[{"family":"Sefton-Green","given":"Julian"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,18]]}},"label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RND9gKyj29yfz}(Mozilla     Foundation, 2014; Sefton-Green, 2013).

The Group's work follows a paradigm for learning research called Constructionism. Several of the chapters directly address the theoretical formulation of Constructionism, and others describe experimental studies which enrich and confirm different aspects of the idea. Thus this volume can be taken as the most extensive and definitive statement to date of this approach to media and education research and practice.

The papers in this book are divided in four interrelated sections as follows:   * Perspectives in Constructionism further develops the intellectual underpinnings of constructionist theory. This section looks closely at the role of perspective-taking in learning and discusses how both cognitive and affective processes play a central role in building connections between old and new knowledge.  * Learning through Design analyzes the relationship between designing and learning, and discusses ways that design activities can provide personally meaningful contexts for learning. This section investigates how and why children can learn through the processes of constructing artifacts such as games, textile patterns, robots and interactive devices.  * Learning in Communities focuses on the social aspects of constructionist learning, recognizing that how people learn is deeply influenced by the communities and cultures with which they interact. It examines the nature of learning in classroom, inner-city, and virtual communities.  * Learning about Systems examines how students make sense of biological, technological, and mathematical systems.

Despite the appeal of the notion that learners construct their understanding, I argue that constructivism is problematic because it ignores the subjectivity of the learner and the socially and historically situated nature of knowing; it denies the essentially collaborative and social nature of meaning making; and it privileges only one form of knowledge, namely, the technical rational. I then present a critique of active learning and student-centered forms of pedagogy. I argue that in our models of teaching we rely on too many unexamined assumptions from developmental psychology and we take for granted the problematic notion that children learn by doing. My central thesis is that constructivism is flawed because of its inability to come to grips with the essential issues of culture, power, and discourse in the classroom. In the concluding section of the article I present a preliminary account of a sociocultural approach to teaching and learning that takes seriously the notion that learning is situated in contexts, that students bring their own subjectivities and cultural perspectives to bear in constructing understanding, that issues of power exist in the classroom that need to be addressed, and that education into scientific ways of knowing requires understanding modes of classroom discourse and enabling students to negotiate these modes effectively so that they may master and critique scientific ways of knowing without, in the process, sacrificing their own personally and culturally constructed ways of knowing.","DOI":"10.1002/tea.3660290805","ISSN":"1098-2736","shortTitle":"Rethinking science education","language":"en","author":[{"family":"O'loughlin","given":"Michael"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]}},"label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDgzfbBmZ2GC}(Fosnot,     1993; O'loughlin, 1992) -   To address the broader move, later work from Kafai incorporates     broader social approaches and attempts to bring them into the     'constructionist' fold     []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"IZHVQct2","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Kafai and Burke, 2015)","plainCitation":"(Kafai and Burke, 2015)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":3644,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/Q7JCMQ3N"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/Q7JCMQ3N"],"itemData":{"id":3644,"type":"article-journal","title":"Constructionist Gaming: Understanding the Benefits of Making Games for Learning","container-title":"Educational Psychologist","page":"313-334","volume":"50","issue":"4","source":"PubMed Central","abstract":"There has been considerable interest in examining the educational potential of playing video games.

Frameworks and Design Strategies --------------------------------

In my research, design frameworks have been useful for as a starting point for my design. Also as a possible output of this study will be a modified framework. As this study aims for practical outputs and not to duplicate existing efforts, a review of some candidates of design frameworks is valid. Criteria for selection here are holistic and advanced frameworks for design, and should have relevance my design, which aims to provoke collaboration and autonomy/ choice, through making a text-game involving making of various digital elements including digital art and audio.

Data Analysis - Activity Theory

Background of socio-cultural approaches. Engestrom linking US and Russian schools.

Overview of parts of AT and third model

Expansive conception of learning and why particularly suited to this intervention.

As the goals of the individuals and the families involved may change as they deepen their participation in the programme. Or shift in and out of individual focus (creativity), family focus, group focus (advance joint learning of creating a game as a group of learners).

Emerging Description of Results -------------------------------

-   Start off by underlining the emergent nature of the results and even     the focus of the research based on emergent and evolving nature of     AT studies (as distinct from some schools of design experiments)     []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"3nWhFZOy","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Nicolopoulou and Cole, 2009)","plainCitation":"(Nicolopoulou and Cole, 2009)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":1313,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/WDGSZM68"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/WDGSZM68"],"itemData":{"id":1313,"type":"article-journal","title":"Design experimentation as a theoretical and empirical tool for developmental pedagogical research","container-title":"Pedagogies: An International Journal","page":"61-71","volume":"5","issue":"1","source":"CrossRef","DOI":"10.1080/15544800903406316","ISSN":"1554-480X, 1554-4818","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Nicolopoulou","given":"Ageliki"},{"family":"Cole","given":"Michael"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12,18]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDCQDKvvB10t}(Nicolopoulou     and Cole, 2009). -   As such following is promising start of this process -   Simple analysis of the dyad, and wider interactions via screen and     audio capture. -   There is a promise to cross reference this with simple gesture     analyis.

This paper explores the\npotential of cultural-historical activity theory to study this relationship. Starting from the complex and multidimensional\nnature of learner autonomy, it highlights some of the weaknesses in the CALL literature addressing some aspects of this\nrelationship. Following a presentation of the main tenets of cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), including the notion of\ncontradiction which is at the core of CHAT, it then seeks to demonstrate how activity theory can assist us in rethinking our\nunderstanding of learner autonomy in the context of technology-rich language learning environments and in formulating suitable\ncriteria and questions, which can guide judgemental and empirical analyses. The paper concludes by illustrating some of the\nprinciples explored through examples drawn from an activity-theoretical judgemental analysis of a French module delivered to\nfirst year students in Dublin City University.","DOI":"10.1017/S0958344004000928","ISSN":"1474-0109, 0958-3440","shortTitle":"CALL and the development of learner autonomy","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Blin","given":"Françoise"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",11]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDU1gjA5ND5p}(Blin, 2004), Kutti expresses the difficulty of expressing relationships between activity and IT as it 'penetrates activities at all levels'

Result - Emerging importance of Media Literacy and fluency

Media literacy and digital fluency, much more than computational thinking and competency was not a core part of my goals but it emerged as one of the big outcomes of pilot studies, thus dimensions of media literacy afforded by the design may emerge.
