**Investigating the Potential of Collaborative Intergenerational Game Making**

**Background**

The increasing prevalence and complexity of digital technology and the subsequent lag in associated teaching strategies is addressed in a recent report on UK computer education (The Royal Society, 2017). The report highlights the potential of digital game making to enhance computing provision and need for more research into this area. It also foregrounds Wing's (2006) conception of computational thinking, which prioritises abstract thought processes and pre-planning, as a key component of a computing curriculum.

Game making is also happening in informal settings including museums, libraries and after school clubs via initiatives like Code Club and Coder Dojo. Here, non-expert volunteers and younger participants form intergenerational learning communities to create games together using accessible technology. While these environments have great potential to inform practice in digital making, teaching of computing and intergenerational approaches, sparse research exists.

This lack of research is disappointing as pioneers of digital game making Papert and Turkle (1990) explored the value of diverse learner pathways, social approaches and multiple media in learning environments in early studies. Subsequent studies have prioritised individual computing progress using particular software tools rather than playful possibilities of material and community activities to support learner autonomy and collaboration in digital making. This study will design a pedagogical framework as part of a participatory game making club for families which addresses these deficits.

**Methodology**

Constructivism will form the core theoretical foundation for this study. Based on constructivism's epistemological belief that knowledge is social and collaboratively constructed, this study will focus on the importance of learner experience. Thus I adopt an applied constructivist approach of student centred learning which highlights feedback, collaboration and learner autonomy (Grabinger and Dunlap, 1995).

**Research Questions**

1.  What methods currently exist to facilitate collaborative learning in     digital game making environments and how effective do participants     and facilitators perceive them to be?

2.  How can activity theory be used to develop a playful pedagogic     framework to facilitate agency and learning in a multi-generational     game making project?

3.  What are the effects of applying of a playful pedagogic framework on     learner autonomy, collaboration and computational thinking skills in     a game making project?

4.  What is an effective way to capture and analyse data to study     collaborative learning in a complex game making environment?

**Research Context & Methods **

Research will happen in phases (timeline in separate document) . Phase activities are outlined in the table above. Data gathering will be undertaken at twice yearly game making courses which I facilitate for MMU's EdLab project. Courses comprise 6 workshops and with 12-15 participants comprising Home Educator parents and children aged 8-12.

P1 begins with interviews with four regional game making facilitators to inform an initial pedagogical framework. The resulting pilot design will be tested with the target group. Two subsequent participatory workshops will record participant feedback and suggested alterations to the design of the intervention.

P2 incorporates a revision of the design and three workshops to test emergent data gathering methods which may include screen capture, wide-angle video of work areas and participant audio logs. The goal is to support naturalistic data analysis without interrupting learning experience or generating unwieldy datasets and address RQ4.

P3 comprises the bulk of data gathering via two iterations of the evolving pedagogical framework using data collection methods emerging from P2. I will take the role of participant observer and focus on user perspective of the learning environment via journal entries and subsequent in-depth interviews with six families to explore areas of emerging interest.

The following table summarises the contents of each phase (a timeline is included as a separate document).

It is expected that rich digital recordings generated by processes developed in P2 and diverse artefacts created by participants as part of the game making process will greatly enhance data on the user perspective in keeping with the constructivist perspective of the study.

**Data Analysis **

The participatory approach outlined above, informed by the philosophical underpinning of constructivism will require an analytical framework capable of interpretation of a rich and reciprocal learning environment over time. Thus activity theory will be used as a suitable lens to analyse the complexity of the emerging pedagogical design including power relations, helping behaviour, role of mediating objects, participant questioning and problem solving strategies (Engeström, 1999).

In P1 a literature review will inform research design and creation of a thematic coding scheme (after Braun and Clarke) to analyse pilot workshop observations. I will use activity theory to analyse interviews of participants in game making communities to represent prototype activity systems of participants, practices and materials.

P2 and P3 are characterised by an on-going analysis of data further refining each iteration of the resultant pedagogical design. While data collection is expected to be extensive, key journal entries will illuminate focal areas. Interview data and digital artefacts of these key moments will be analysed with a particular focus on group dynamics via interaction process analysis (Bales, 2001).
