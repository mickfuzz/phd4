**Investigating the potential of collaborative multi-generational gamemaking.**

This study seeks greater understanding of processes of the formation ofplayful game making communities to enhance computing provision ininformal learning spaces.

The increasing prevalence and complexity of digital technology andsubsequent lag in associated teaching strategies is addressed in arecent report on UK computer education (The Royal Society, 2017) Wing'sconception of computational thinking, which is foregrounded in thereport as a key component of a computing curriculum, will be criticallyevaluated in this study (2006). The report also highlights the potentialof digital game making to complement existing strategies and the needfor more research into this area.

Beyond formal education, there is strong potential for game making ininformal learning in museums, libraries and after school clubs viainitiatives like Code Club and Coder Dojo. Here, non-expert volunteersand younger participants form intergenerational learning communitiesabout which there is currently spare research (Cucinelli et al., 2018).

This study will examine a learning environment comprising of diversepathways and media, a focus present at genesis of studies of digitalgame making and one explored by Papert and Turkle (1990). While theirstudies highlighted the pluralism of approaches possible rich gamemaking communities involving both digital and physical objects, manysubsequent studies focus on individual progress and particular softwaretools and thus deemphasise the playful, collaborative possibilities oflinked, non-software activities. (Resnick tinkering?)

**Theoretical Framework** Constructivism will form the core theoreticalfoundation for this study, in particular the social collaborativeelements of the theory. Specifically, this study is influence by theapproaches of student centred learning, with a particular focus on theimpact of feedback and metacognition on learner autonomy.

A Constructionist lens will focus constructivist concepts focusing onthe role of physical materials and digital objects in the learningprocess.

Activity theory will be used to represent complexity of learning processto go beyond efficacy of interventions to study interactions includingpower relations, helping behaviour, role of mediating objects,participant questioning and problem solving strategies (Engeström,1999).

**Methods and Activities**

Data gathering will be undertaken in stages. Stage one (RQ1) includes apilot of a minimum of eight 2 hours sessions with pilot group (homeeducation families), four interviews with practitioners in the field andfour with families active in the field.

Stage two (RQ2,4) incorporates a co-design approach using participantinformation from RQ1 to create a framework. Testing of data gatheringmethods is also carried out in three pilot workshops.

Stage three RQ3,4) comprises data gathering via two iterations of eighttwo hour sessions with target groups (as in table)

Stage Four includes Analysis of data and writing up of results

As facilitator, I will take the role of participant observer. I willtake notes in sessions, and supplement them with extensive journalentries and use of recording equipment.

Game making will happen at stations exploring different media andactivities, including graphic, audio, coding and narrative planning.Video cameras will record activity at each of the stations. Where codinghappens video screen capture and audio recordings will be made.

**Data Analysis **

A literature review will inform research design and creation of athematic coding scheme to analyse workshop observations.

I will use activity theory to analyse interview of practitioners inmulti-age game making communities. From this I will map potentialactivity systems built around intersecting game making practices andmaterials.

Due to the rich naturalistic nature of the environment I will be lookingfor key interactions identified in my journal which illustratetransformation moments or have potential to illuminate significantissues identified in participant learning.

The following areas are of particular interest given the background ofthis study and I anticipate they will be of interest when results areanalysed; transformations surrounding attitudes to participation indigital making cultures, impact of learning design in engagement offemale participants, complementary role of physical materials in adigital making environment.
