## Discussion and Links to other Observations

There are three key pieces of learning that I can initially draw from this interaction which feature extensively in my design and observation journals. These are:  \


* participant awareness of game making patterns and systems concepts
* evidence of different types of game maker behaviour
* the competing value and characteristics of different code errors.


### Game Making Patterns and Systems Concepts

 \
For both participants there is an explicit awareness of game making patterns and concept of the game as a dynamic system. Both seem to drive their work on the design and coding mechanics of the game.

Game making patterns are outlined by both the child and parent. They talk of adding more levels, of the mechanic of keys and doors and then progressing to another level. The child takes delight in outlining this pattern of game progression. The transformation from the period of time when her parent was problem solving code is dramatic. I propose that a contributing factor to this motivation is the ability to replicate a familiar pattern of game play via her own work in construction. It is the ability to translate this home knowledge into her own artefact which gives a sense of mastery over an otherwise foreign environment.

In terms of understanding of the game as a dynamic system, this is seen clearly in the parent’s alarm at the child’s deletion of all elements of hazard. The parent is keen to keep a sense of game balance to ensure a sense of challenge for the imagined player. “It’s no fun having a game without any hazards to avoid.” The child seems determined to remove all hazards. My understanding is that she is also aware of implications for game balance but is taking pleasure in this seeming destruction of the key challenge of the game as an act of disruptive play.


### Game Maker Types \


In and early tentative attempt to define in broad strokes the types of game maker behaviour and underlying goals. In doing this I have taken inspiration from Bartle’s game player types and adapted this based on notes in my observation journal and extracts from screen capture like the one above.



* **Social makers:** form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game
* **Planners:** like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
* **Magpie makers:** like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
* **Glitchers:** mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc for other users

There is more on these player and maker types in a book chapter outlining the process and materials used in my programme here. [https://en.flossmanuals.net/phaser-game-making-in-glitch/_full/#choose-your-own-adventure](https://en.flossmanuals.net/phaser-game-making-in-glitch/_full/#choose-your-own-adventure)

In this interaction we can see attributes of the child as a Glitcher. They are not taking pleasure from ignoring concepts of what should be done to maintain game balance and from the sense of shock from their current audience her parent. Going against this convention is a type of playful destruction in this context.  

**_Contrasting to other data: _**In the latest version of the game making programme this year the child changed perspectives and still included elements of such trickiness but in a different way which retained an element of game balance. In this latest game the child added a bunch of grapes to the last level of a game that involved collecting fruit and avoiding cheese. Contrary to expectations touching the grapes involved the player dying.  This feature allowed a resolution of the conflict between parent and child in that other elements of game mechanics and use of space were more balanced.

This was induced by a challenge issued in the later learning design to make the game more challenging as it progressed. This challenge seemed to provoke the glitcher’s response to make this a tricky response. This can be said to have resolved a previous conflict between parent and child priorities in a positive way as the child’s previous glitching strategy to remove challenge was only limited value in sustaining her interest.


### Types of Errors

In my RD2 results section I started to describe different kinds of errors and block associated with code programming. In the context surrounding this interaction the parent had tried valiantly to overcome a conflict caused by incomplete documentation and her own incomplete knowledge of the computationals patterns used in the construction of the game’s code. 

In trying new locations for a new line of code that she was adding she alternated between and subsequent experiments


* **A bug** where there was an error which caused the game to break and generated an error and a blank screen
* A **no effect** behavior error where the desired behaviour just didn't happen but other game aspects are not affected
* **A glitch** where the desired behaviour didn't happen and something completely unexpected happened instead.

As mentioned in the RD2 I have come to celebrate glitches as a way of exploring what is happening in the code together with participants. However bugs are potentially more frustrating. As a facilitator I feel a need to fix the code as the debugging methods I am using may be beyond the technical ability of the participants. As such there seems less opportunity to learn things together with the participants.

Analysis of the different kinds of errors that are likely to arrive and testing different strategies for dealing with them that take into account the ZPD of the participants may provide not only useful input for the participants, but also opportunities to check understandings of processes and game patterns and computational patterns in use. Such analysis could be of use to other researchers and facilitators.
