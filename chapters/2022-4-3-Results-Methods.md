## Starting thoughts on writing up results.

The 3M model as a pedagogical model which aligns with PBL principles and more general social approach to learning coding.

A start here of mapping in a Matrix that could be included in a concluding chapter.

### Motivational Methods

The final M of the 3M framework stands for motivational methods. These methods are inspired by other projects involving a community approach to teaching technology. Here, I share two methods that emerged from feedback and partnership work that proved valuable in the context of game making.

**Physical Computing and Game Making:** The use of physical computing to create concrete and tangible activities can increase the engagement and motivation of learners [@kaloti-hallak_students_2015]. Making the digital concepts physical, and thus allowing exploration via diverse means, also aligns with inclusive learning principles. To support my game making projects, I created simple arcade cabinets out of wood with retro arcade buttons. Connecting arcade buttons to the computer via simple electronics is a project which can be completed quickly. The process of students building their own arcade cabinets for a games showcase increased their perception of the authenticity of their end goal. Some families created low-tech, customised arcade cabinets using cardboard. Although my studies have been small-scale the self-reported effects on learner engagement and motivation of this part of the program were significant.

**Drama / Fictional Frameworks:** Another method I use to increase learner engagement in game making is the concept of using a fictional scenario or simulation. A fictional community while less authentic than a professional community, can still provide some of the associated benefits of authenticity. I have worked with practitioners of Drama Education department at Manchester Metropolitan University to develop such fictional dramas, but you do not have to be a trained drama practitioner to draw on key techniques to increase learner engagement. For example, I asked trainee teachers to devise a scenario to support a series of sessions and they used a fiction of making games for an alien race coming to destroy the earth. The process of using a fictional situation can help with the motivation and reflection of learners in the following ways:

- Asking learners to step into a role can increase identification with participation in the project. For example you may say "As game designers, we will make this game for a particular audience".
- Fictional situations can help create a sense of imagined jeopardy which can help learners stay on track with their creative timescale and may increase their commitment to the process.
-  When learners share their games with their real or imagined audience, they can talk through their design decisions and challenges, thus creating an opportunity for reflection.
- Drama processes can help explore identification with or hostility to gaming cultures.
