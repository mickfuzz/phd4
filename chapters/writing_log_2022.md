# Writting Log 2022

I'm entering a complicated phase after book chapters. Notes here may help.

## 3.4.2022 -
- created a new chapters section - and moved lots of data / writing in to the planning part of it
- looking at "writing on emerging results 2020 doc" and also the RD2 - to try to extract any relevant writing on methodology.- I put this into - chapters/holding/methodology_notes.md
- trying to keep an eye on how to present results when doing reading
