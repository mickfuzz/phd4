## Theoretical Framework

### Introduction to social turn, school,
As explored in the intro and lit review there are particular limitations in the kind of empirical research that characterises many studies involving game making. Many of these limitations involve research in to background cultures of participants and how they can be involved into making activities and a focus on creating and sustaining an authentic learning environment.

This focus on the environment and context is in line with social and cultural lines of research. Socio-cultural research and perspectives can be broadly described as...

For the focus of this study on developing game coding abilities particular aspects of importance are of understanding of the importance of context, and the ongoing development of cultural artefacts

As we have seen in the literature review on game making, context plays out in the way
 that xy, and z.

Barab and Squire [@barab_design-based_2004]

The focus of this study is on the construction of shared meaning and practices as part of an emerging community of game makers. To do this I adopt a sociocultural approach and specifically design-based research. This section explores complementary methodologies of value before outlining key characteristics of design-based research which make it an attractive candidate for this study.

## Why a social focus rather than Piaget's constructivism


Cobb -@cobb_where_1994 identifies two broad schools of constructivism, one focusing more on individual cognitive processes which follows the work of Piaget and the other drawing on the academic lineage of Vygotsky which locates knowledge formation as a cultural activity. Much of the foundational literature on game making focuses on personal dimensions of learning (Harel and Papert, 1991; Kafai and Burke, 2015; Kafai and Resnick, 1996). They draw on Papert's constructionist approach which extends a piagetian take to propose that construction of personal knowledge happens best where learners can experiment and manipulate objects Ackermann, 2001). Such a focus on individual learning is problematic from perspective of sociocultural approaches due to a tendency to ignore both contextual factors influencing the learning setting and the evolving use of resources, processes and shared understandings by emergent communities of learners O'loughlin, 1992). Some of the specifics of these processes have already been named in the section above looking at collaboration. Other concepts of value include Vygotsky's concept of mediated action Wertsch, 1994); Rogoff's take on guided participation within a community of learners Rogoff, 1993); and more detailed analysis of roles community-based transfer of knowledge in practice Lave and Wenger, 1991).

While noting the limits of an individualist approach of many studies from constructionist researchers, it is important not to dismiss the value of this lineage of studies. Notably, later work from Kafai incorporates broader social approaches and attempts to bring them into the constructionist fold Kafai and Burke, 2015). Kafai and Burke draw on the conceptions of Rogoff 1993) of personal, social and community learning planes to advocate the wide-ranging benefits of 'constructionist gaming'. However for this study constructionism seems of best value in providing design guidelines but much weaker as either an underlying theoretical or analytical framework.

As my study seeks to address cultural factors which act as barriers to participation in digital making, it requires a method of research which allows the detailed description and evaluation of complex, emergent learning environments. While other suitable methodological approaches exist including participatory design Muller, 2007), ethnography and guided participation, Rogoff et al., 1993), communities of practice Lave and Wenger, 1991), Activity Theory
, I have chosen


## Design-based research and Intervention studies within educational field

My own research in game making is an experimental approach to create a new learning design. I have worked with young learners, local families and undergraduate student helpers to evolve a game making design. A key driver of my research was to explore the potential to draw on family experience in learning activities by working with families to make games together. I propose that this environment is a fertile research base to jointly create learning activities with a wider potential application. To facilitate this goal I have taken a design-based approach which acknowledges the importance of context in educational research [@brown_design_1992]. Design based research is a varied discipline which can take a multitude of forms [@mckenney_educational_2021]. The core elements include: research as an intervention, iteration, involvement of participants in the evolution of designs, and a flexibility of research outcome based on how events unfold [@easterday_design-based_2014]. One of the key motivations of this approach is to produce educational research that has a high utility for practitioners through developing theory that is rooted in contextual practice and which can produce new pedagogies and resources [@cobb_design_2003-2].  

Barab and Squire [-@barab_design-based_2004] describe the messiness of design-based research and that this creates a challenge to the researcher of how to present results in a coherent way which is of use to other practitioners. There is a tension between sticking closely to the context of the research and the concrete specifics or stepping back to generalise and being lost in abstraction. Here, I try to strike a balance which stays concrete but which also pulls from my observations a framework which may translate in to other game-making and creative project based approaches.

Another guiding principle of design-based research - which is present in the techniques of design experiments, mutual appropriation and participatory action research - is that research participants also influence the ongoing design of the research [@barab_critical_2004; @cobb_design_2003; @downing-wilson_design_2011]. The design of the research experiment and learning I started from a very open position and has evolved from several iterations of collaborative work with participants. One experimental team consisted of Home Educating families another involved local primary schools with Year 6 (10-11 year old) classes. Learners acted as researcher participants to guide the next iteration of the game making program both directly and indirectly. Direct input was through requests and informal feedback and structured end-of-course interviews. Indirect input came from research data in the form on the games participants created, my research journal entries on my interactions with and observations of participants and recorded audio and video data of the participants and their computer screen capture.


## Data gathering methods and justification

My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer (facilitator and designer), participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. Specifically I will study in detail the use of the online help tutorials and example code snippets I have created and the code and other media content that participants create in their resulting video games. I also include other methods which suit the deeper analysis of participant actions to help construct models of activity systems, namely the videoing of the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants.

One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour. Large amounts of video data are being gathered, up to 20 hours of footage for each 2 hour session. I am developing a process of identifying appropriate episodes for closer analysis. I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies Derry et al., 2010). I will use a variant of discourse analysis to explore interactions of participants captured on video recordings. Mercer and colleagues identify discourse analysis as a loose associations of methods to support linguistic analysis of interactions to identify emergent patterns Mercer et al., 2004). While a common pattern in classroom interactions is that of IRF, initiation (teacher), response (student) and follow up (teacher) Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975), the inherent assumption that a teacher will be leading an activity will not consistently be appropriate for my study; although at times a parent may take this role. Other discourse analysis frameworks that take a sociocultural approach Lyle, 1993; Phillips, 1985), and specifically those from project focused studies Hmelo-Silver and Barrows, 2008; Moje et al., 2001), may be of greater use to allow more detailed treatment of the incorporation of tools and cultural artefacts into a collective discourse. To avoid distraction from AT as my principle analytical framework I am in agreement with Wells 1999, p. 172) who proposes the use of AT's concepts to situate 'spoken discourse \... as one, but only one, of the semiotic tools that participants use to achieve the goals of action'. Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals.

Turning attention to the gathering and analysis of other data, such a rich set of data, will allow the cross referencing of the many sources. My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music. To be able to effectively analyse these diverse sources, I will need to prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes. I explore some of the emerging themes and criteria for selection which incidents to explore in depth in the results section below. Again while diversity of data invites drawing on diverse methods of analysis, AT will provide a foundation for the analysis of these diverse data.

Generalisation is one of the guiding principles of DBR. While results are intertwined with context, designs should be assessed for generalisation to other settings.

### Journal notes on participation, partial screen capture data,   

In early stages of delivery I adopted an open project based approach. I will later describe how this evolved in to a template game using a javascript game making library and an online tool used for phases 1-4 which participants were invited to add to and alter.

 The last iterations of the learning design adopted the MakeCode Arcade tool as a new game authoring tool. This block based programming environment reduced participant coding errors allowing a greater focus on game making concepts.

 My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer, participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. I also record the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants. One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour.

 I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies (Derry et al., 2010). I will use a variant of discourse analysis to explore interactions of participants captured on video recordings. Mercer and colleagues identify discourse analysis as a loose associations of methods to support linguistic analysis of interactions to identify emergent patterns (Mercer et al., 2004). While a common pattern in classroom interactions is that of IRF, initiation (teacher), response (student) and follow up (teacher) (Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975), the inherent assumption that a teacher will be leading an activity will not consistently be appropriate for my study; although at times a parent may take this role. Other discourse analysis frameworks that take a sociocultural approach (Lyle, 1993; Phillips, 1985), and specifically those from project focused studies (Hmelo-Silver and Barrows, 2008; Moje et al., 2001), may be of greater use to allow more detailed treatment of the incorporation of tools and cultural artefacts into a collective discourse.

 <!-- To avoid distraction from AT as my principle analytical framework I am in agreement with Wells (1999, p. 172) who proposes the use of AT's concepts to situate 'spoken discourse \... as one, but only one, of the semiotic tools that participants use to achieve the goals of action'. Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals. -->

 My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use and other relevant interests. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music.

 <!-- AT allows an exploration these diverse sources of information as mediating artefacts which are the enabler and product of the shifting goals and outcomes of the programmes participants. -->

 While the rich set of data invites the cross referencing of the many sources, it also presents challenge on how to deal effectively with the large amounts of data being gathered. The use of a 360 camera reduces the amount of live video footage of interactions needed. Instead of multiple cameras pointed in different directions to capture participant interaction, participants are arranged in a square pointing inwards towards a central 360 degree camera. When triangulating data from various sources, I will prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes.

 <!-- A key strategy of AT used to locate learning happening in an environment, is via the identification of contradictions between different elements of the activity systems and subsequent study of how these contradictions are resolved (Engeström and Sannino, 2010). I plan to use my journal and participant interviews to identify key moments of contradictions and resolution to study in greater detail using the range of data available. I am also inspired by the work of Oliver and Pelletier (2006)who employed contradictions between systemic elements to create a coding scheme used to interpret video data in a study on game based learning. -->

### Description of Phases

I have carried out three stages of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline activities that have taken place at each stage of activity and include some early results.

<!-- I have carried out six phases of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline the core activities that have taken place including only the most basic detail on tools used. In following sections, the development of toolsets are analysed in greater depth. The core of the game making programme, which emerged in the first phase and has remained, is a starting template of a simple platform game which participants alter to make their own. The evolution of different versions and locations of this starting template has proven to be a key marker of the progress of the programme. The timeline of phases of activities is outlined in the following table.

#### Common between Phases

Certain features either common practice, or inspired by research and interviews, were common to all phases.

* Playtesting
* Showcase


#### Phase One

The first phase of delivery in late 2018 was based on initial research stage; I drew on literature to identify factors to consider when designing for collaboration. I adopted an open project based approach which integrated drama games to aid group bonding and reflection.

I chose a tool set which drew on relevant design principles explored earlier (Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013).

The tools allow participants to create games using a combination of a free to use online tools. They comprise a coding environment using the phaser javascript game library (glitch.com), a pixel art editor (piskelapp.com), and a sound effect generator (sfbgames.com/chiptone).

 One of the principles that I prioritised in the choice of tools was that of immediate feedback for participants. For example, in the code editing interface of glitch.com shown in Illustration 1, changes made to the code on the left section take immediate effect in the resultant game on the right side of the screen.

In terms of supporting resources, stage one was exploratory and responsive; I had no pre-existing supporting materials and created a starting code framework of a platform game and code examples to add extra functionality to the game as the programme developed.

At the end of this stage participants showed their games to students in the foyer of the MMU Brooks building and gave me feedback on their participation in the programme.

#### Phase Two

The second phase in early 2019 drew on this participant feedback and detailed reading of relevant literature to bring substantial changes to the programme. While still driven by participant interests, it took a more structured approach. The resources included small scale starting challenges as A5 hand-outs, step-by-step tutorials as print outs, and code examples as online projects illustrating key additions to the game.

I have brought the workshops resources together a book published on the FLOSS Manuals documentation platform (Chesterman, 2019) and an online project-hub linking to all resources (Chesterman and Potts, 2019).

<!-- I also carried out four video-recorded interviews with practitioners who work with creative methods and technology with young people or families. Early analysis of these interviews has helped shape the evolving design of my programme and has brought into focus key areas of interest already identified in journal entries. -->

Second iteration in May 2019 I drew on previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department (Patterson et al., 2019) to create a simple drama process to give a simple external motivation and narrative to the creation of games for a fictional audience of visiting aliens.

I also began the data gathering of . I recorded all interactions via use of 360 camera and screen capture of workstations and undertook post-course interviews with participants. Work on analysis of this data is contained in early results section below.
