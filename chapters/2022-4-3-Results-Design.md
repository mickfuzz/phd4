## Evolution of Design

I am separating out this writing into a separate chapter for the moment. It may need to be integrated into others.
This should be framed within DBR language and concepts.

For now just descriptive, based on observation of what was happening with participants and my journal notes.


### Description of Phases

I have carried out three stages of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline activities that have taken place at each stage of activity and include some early results.

#### Common between Phases

Certain features either common practice, or inspired by research and interviews, were common to all phases.

* Playtesting
* Showcase
* Drama Games

#### Phase One

The first phase of delivery in late 2018 was based on initial research stage; I drew on literature to identify factors to consider when designing for collaboration. I adopted an open project based approach which integrated drama games to aid group bonding and reflection.

I chose a tool set which drew on relevant design principles explored earlier (Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013).

The tools allow participants to create games using a combination of a free to use online tools. They comprise a coding environment using the phaser javascript game library (glitch.com), a pixel art editor (piskelapp.com), and a sound effect generator (sfbgames.com/chiptone).

 One of the principles that I prioritised in the choice of tools was that of immediate feedback for participants. For example, in the code editing interface of glitch.com shown in Illustration 1, changes made to the code on the left section take immediate effect in the resultant game on the right side of the screen.

In terms of supporting resources, stage one was exploratory and responsive; I had no pre-existing supporting materials and created a starting code framework of a platform game and code examples to add extra functionality to the game as the programme developed.

At the end of this stage participants showed their games to students in the foyer of the MMU Brooks building and gave me feedback on their participation in the programme.

#### Phase Two

The second phase in early 2019 drew on this participant feedback and detailed reading of relevant literature to bring substantial changes to the programme. While still driven by participant interests, it took a more structured approach. The resources included small scale starting challenges as A5 hand-outs, step-by-step tutorials as print outs, and code examples as online projects illustrating key additions to the game.

I brought the workshops resources together a book published on the FLOSS Manuals documentation platform (Chesterman, 2019) and an online project-hub linking to all resources (Chesterman and Potts, 2019). In the first iteration the hub linked to self contained games which contained code examples of game design patterns. 


<!-- I also carried out four video-recorded interviews with practitioners who work with creative methods and technology with young people or families. Early analysis of these interviews has helped shape the evolving design of my programme and has brought into focus key areas of interest already identified in journal entries. -->


I also began the data gathering of . I recorded all interactions via use of 360 camera and screen capture of workstations and undertook post-course interviews with participants. Work on analysis of this data is contained in early results section below.

#### Phase Three

Second iteration in May 2019 I drew on previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department [@pattersonDramaSTEM2019] to create a simple drama process to give a simple external motivation and narrative to the creation of games for a fictional audience of visiting aliens.

I revised the  an online project-hub to link to the project chapters rather than the code examples.


#### Evolution of Template and supporting resources
I'm not sure if this even goes into this chapter - it certainly starts to answer some of the research questions.

Go into more detail than previously on the choice and use of tools.

Revisit FM book as a guide for Glitch/ Phaser



### Issues Emerging from Evolution of Design

More detailed analysis - thoughts on validity of data -->



<!-- I have carried out six phases of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline the core activities that have taken place including only the most basic detail on tools used. In following sections, the development of toolsets are analysed in greater depth. The core of the game making programme, which emerged in the first phase and has remained, is a starting template of a simple platform game which participants alter to make their own. The evolution of different versions and locations of this starting template has proven to be a key marker of the progress of the programme. The timeline of phases of activities is outlined in the following table.
