Questions ---------

-   How effective is digital game making to improve problem solving skills in intergenerational learning contexts?

-   How to best design an inclusive digital game making environment aimed at intergenerational groups?

-   What impact does using authentic web technologies have in terms of authenticity of context and goals and resulting motivational issues including self determination?

-   What is the impact of code playgrounds and collaborative text code projects on integrating multiple strands of project work, and thus facilitate a "many paths" approach?

-   Impact of family learning environment on collaborative video games making?

-   Is there an impact on the willingness of family units to ngage with learning stemming from the positive affect of parents towards retro video games?

-   To what extent can the characteristics of code playgrounds reduce fear of text coding?

-   **Can using activity theory with participants help develop their understanding of systems and engender deeper equality of participation in the process**

-   

Notes on possible Methods -------------------------

Questionnaires

-   Pre and post questionnaire. (but what to measure? Ability or  > attitude?)

-   Post questionnaire only, potential self determination focus.

Observation & Documentation

-   Naturalistic observation and notes for emergent issues

-   Video and screen capture, of a coding work station

-   Audio capture of a coding work station

-   Video and audio capture of non digital workstation, perhaps story boarding opening scene

Interviews

-   

Analysis  ---------

Analysis of the global working environment of club activity via activity theory framework into interrelated systems. Particular focus on the combination and manipulation of assets.

Choose an applied and adapted constructivist or constructionist framework or to code activity against also code against a computational abilities frame, to identify iteration, conditional, etc.

Notes on challenges making environments inclusive  --------------------------------------------------

-   Facilitating and planning multiple paths

-   Designing strategies to merge work together.

-   Importance of physical objects in generation processes but danger that these become to time consuming if I am most interested in digital collaboration

-   Strategies to accept complexity, divergent paths and finding ways to facilitate participants bringing them together.

-   Facilitating participants to follow their interests within a manageable frame and scope

-   Communication of scope and collaboration strategies without families losing interest

-   Use of tools that are accessible but then can be transferred and used in other domains.
