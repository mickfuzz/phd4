# Methodology

## Introduction

This chapter sets out the methodological approach underpinning this study, building directly from the theoretical commitments explored in Chapter 3. Drawing on the principles of activity theory  and design-based research (DBR), this research was designed as an iterative, situated process embedded in a real-world, non-formal learning environment. Rather than applying a fixed method to a controlled setting, the study developed responsively, shaped by the complex interplay of context, participant input, and pedagogical experimentation.

Chapter 3 introduced the conceptual foundations shaping this approach: learning as socially and historically situated, agency as emergent and distributed, and design as a driver of transformation. These principles are here translated into methodological commitments, especially a focus on mutuality with participants, flexibility in design, and responsiveness to the evolving dynamics of the setting. The chapter begins by establishing the scope of the research as qualitative, general, and exploratory. It then discusses the authenticity of the context, the significance of my dual role as researcher-facilitator, and the rationale for a method that privileges a rich approach to detail. Following this, the chapter details how the project was delivered in practice, including the recruitment process, session formats, and the diverse forms of data collected such as journal entries, artefacts, video and screen recordings.

The analytical process developed over three broad stages. In the early phase, journal reflections, interviews and preliminary video reviews helped surface initial patterns and contradictions. This was followed by a deeper exploratory phase of theme clustering and iterative coding, including attempts at both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The final stage involved selecting key vignettes for closer analysis, integrating participant voices and triangulating across data sources to refine conceptual insights into learner agency, tool use, and learning processes. The chapter concludes with reflections on ethical considerations, validity  of the data analysis, returning to the methodological frameworks of activity theory and DBR, considering how this study both draws from and contributes to those evolving traditions. At this stage the limitations of the thesis are also examined.




### Defining Scope and Approach

This chapter outlines a methodological approach grounded in the general principles of formative interventions and design-based research (DBR). To do this it will  draw on techniques from those disciplines including specifically social design-based experiments (SDBE) and design-based implementation research (DBIR) [@penuel_design-based_2021].

While the previous chapters have established the theoretical framework and research questions, this chapter connects those questions more directly to methods. To provide a an overview to ground the reader, an outline how the research questions informed data collection, analysis, and theoretical framing follows:

**RQ1**: *What contradictions emerged during participation in CGD&P activities, and how were they addressed via an innovative pedagogy?*  
Data were drawn from video observations, participant and practitioner interviews, facilitator reflections, and gameplay interactions. These were analysed through systemic tension mapping and activity system analysis, using cultural-historical activity theory to frame contradictions as drivers of expansive transformation.

**RQ2**: *How can a collection of game design patterns support CGD&P, particularly regarding abstract and concrete dimensions of existing pedagogies?*  
Data included gameplay documentation, screen capture analysis, and participant reflections on pattern use. Thematic analysis focused on mediation through design patterns and how these related to shifts in learning activity. Framing drew on the mediational lens of CHAT and the pedagogical scaffolding emphasis of DBR.

**RQ3**: *How do learner agency and game-maker identity develop within CGD&P communities of practice, and what pedagogical strategies best support this evolution across diverse learning contexts?*  
A longitudinal dataset spanning phases of community interactions and design development, interviews, and field notes was analysed through thematic clustering, relational mapping, and narrative analysis. This was informed by DBR’s emphasis on iterative refinement and 3GAT’s view of expansive learning in situated activity.

### A Qualitative, General, and Exploratory Approach

This study is qualitative, general, and exploratory in nature, shaped by DBR and CHAT. It adopts an iterative, context-sensitive approach to understanding learning environments in CGD&P, avoiding rigid experimental constraints. In terms of educational objectives, the goal is to generate situated knowledge that can inform responsive educational practices rather than to produce more universally generalisable outcomes [@cobb_design_2003]. However, the methodology of this research also seeks to reveal pedagogical tensions, contradictions, and shifts in learner agency and develop understandings which have potential for a broader application.

Rather than starting with fixed aims, the inquiry evolved through mutual engagement with participants and an openness to emergent goals. This orientation is justified both by the nature of the setting (non-formal, collaborative, and often resistant to conventional evaluation [CITAION]) and by the desire to avoid prematurely deciding on what kinds of pedagogical or methodological innovations might arise. While certain features remained consistent throughout, the process was fundamentally shaped by what unfolded during iterative cycles of engagement.

MOVED HERE
This emphasis on rapid iteration aligns with the aims of this thesis, where the ongoing feedback from participants informed the development of a novel learning design via phases of delivery. The iterative nature of DBR, with its focus on refining learning materials in response to feedback, supports the dynamic, practice-based approach explored in the following chapters. By integrating these DBR concepts, this thesis leverages the strengths of design-based approaches while aligning them with the systemic insights offered by CHAT. This flexible approach addresses both the complexities of real-world learning contexts and the need for practical, and ideally replicable outcomes.

Pedagogical elements of the research design were  co-developed through collaboration with young learners, their families, and undergraduate student helpers. Over time, iterative design phases were informed by participant feedback, emergent needs, and reflection on practice. This collaborative shaping of both tools and pedagogy reflects established principles in participatory research [@iversen_computational_2018-1; @iivari_critical_2017], DBR [@barab_design-based_2004], and formative interventions [@cole_fifth_2006; @blunden_formative_2023].

Participant input took multiple forms: direct feedback in interviews and structured activities, observations of gameplay and design behaviour, and artefacts produced in workshops. The ongoing trialling and adjustment of software environments, templates, and resources took place over an extended period and, involved undergraduate trainees, colleagues, and parent volunteers. These iterative changes are documented throughout the study and explored further in Chapters 5 to 7.

Bakker offers guidance in the formulation of research questions in DBR studies which are relevant to this thesis [@bakker_design_2018]. He promotes HOW and WHAT CONSIDERATIONS formulation of question to be represent the exploratory nature of DBR approaches and to increase the possibility of possible generalisation without over promising in terms of projecting beyond the embedded nature of the findings as embedded in the context of the study.

### Utility, Holistic Data and  Rich Descriptions  

This study provide _thick_, descriptive accounts of learning in CGD&P across multiple levels of activity [@maxwell_qualitative_2013]. Informed by Rogoff’s [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of analysis in communities of learners, data collection included both individual and group-level video capture, journal notes, screen recordings, and design artefacts. These layered sources enabled analysis of how learning processes unfolded across time, tools, and interactions. This approach also brought challenges, particularly in managing and interpreting complex video data, which are discussed later in this chapter.

The commitment to rich description is not just analytical rigour but also driven by the purpose of sharing of pedagogical practice to fellow practitioners. Following Ann Brown’s original call for design experiments to align with the needs of real-world learning contexts [@brown_design_1992], and later work by Bakker and Penuel, for utility to be at the heart of the DBR process, this research prioritises design decisions that allow for replicability in both academic and diverse educational contexts.

Applied to software, tools should be replicable within the target audience of informal settings which may have restricted budget.  FLOSS or freely available tools were used wherever feasible, following software sustainability principles [@crouch_software_2013], and ensuring that both the pedagogical design and research methodology can be adopted or adapted by others [@bonneel_code_2020].

### Authentic and Ecological Orientation

To produce findings are contextually valid and socially relevant, pedagogical interventions too place within a real-world CGD&P learning programme in a non-formal educational context shaped by home education practices, local community logistics, and varied participant demographics. This ecological embeddedness shaped recruitment, session scheduling, and the kinds of learning interactions that were possible (covered in a following section). These factors also brought an authenticity that aligns with ecosystem models of learning design [@barnett_ecosystem_2019]  where value is created through contextually relevant pedagogical engagement.

### Researcher–Facilitator Dual Role

My role as both researcher and facilitator was central to the methodological design. Each data collection session was also a workshop, planned and adapted to meet the varied needs of participants. While this dual role introduced challenges such as balancing intervention with observation and recognising positionality, it also provided opportunities for sustained engagement, flexible design, and a clearer view of pedagogical evolution in action.

As explored in Fifth Dimension work by Cole and others, this researcher-practitioner stance invites critical reflection on the ethics, logistics, and value of practice-based inquiry. Throughout the process, I aimed to recognise and support emergent participant practices, using tools and scaffolds that could adapt dynamically. These choices are revisited across the following findings chapters, which trace how participants responded to, reshaped, and extended the learning environment.



## Data collection within project delivery phases


This section outlines both the delivery of the game-making programme and the data collection activities embedded within each phase. As the next chapter presents the evolution of the intervention as a design narrative, the focus here is primarily on methods of data collection and the analytical approaches they supported.

The project was delivered over five distinct phases, along with a development period. Each phase involved changes to tools, group sizes, and facilitation practices. These shifts reflected both planned redesign and more responsive adaptations to participant needs. Figure 4.x shows a summary of these phases.

**Fig. 4.x Summary of delivery phases and development periods**

My involvement in previous work through the EdLab programme[^1] and its playful technology strand meant that I had already built relationships with a number of home-educating families. Between 2016 and the start of this study, I had run various workshops in libraries, the university, and through CoderDojo events. These helped maintain contact with families, supported by regular posts in three established home education communication networks[^2]. I recruited participants informally, sharing a short message and asking interested adults to contact me by email. Once they did, I sent them a participation sheet and asked for confirmation of interest. Further ethical considerations are addressed later in this chapter.

The following table gives an overview of participant numbers, number of sessions, and key learning activities by phase. These changes in focus and activity shaped the kinds of data generated, and also influenced the form and feasibility of collection.

| Phase | Sessions | Participants | Key learning activities and data generated |
|-------|----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| P1    | 10       | 5 (p) + 8 (c) | Exploratory phase with three larger groups of mixed ages. Data includes paper-based planning, basic coding using a text-based toolset, and early asset creation. Game files and code were collected. See Appendix t.x. |
| P2    | 6        | 8 (p) + 11 (c) + 4 (sh) | Groups became smaller and more focused. A shared template supported game development. Asset creation was more limited, but participants used printed guides extensively. [^3] |
| P3    | 5        | 4 (p) + 8 (c) + 1 (sh) | Same coding environment as in P2. Additional drama activities and side missions were introduced. See Appendix t.x. |
| P4    | 6        | 4 (p) + 7 (c) | MakeCode, a block-based toolset[^4], was introduced and used throughout. Sessions became more modular. See Appendix t.x. |
| P5    | 5        | 3 (p) + 3 (c) | A smaller cohort continued to use MakeCode, focusing on individual and pair-based work. See Appendix t.x. |

The development of learning resources took place alongside delivery, and participants influenced this process in various ways. Some changes were shaped by direct input, such as help requests, informal conversations, and interviews. Others were shaped by more indirect means, including the games participants made, my journal entries reflecting on interactions, and video or screen capture data from sessions.

The table below outlines the types of data collected and where they occurred across the phases.

| Name                        | Details                             | Description                                                                                          | Used in which phases |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Screen capture data         | 72 recordings from 12 sessions      | Recorded using Flashback Pro. Included video, audio, mouse activity, and keystrokes.                 | P2, P3, P4, P5        |
| 360 video data              | 9 recordings from 9 sessions        | Captured using a 360-degree camera on SD card.                                                       | P2, P3, P4            |
| Journal entries             | 3 paper journals and 50 pages digital | Reflections, session planning, design sketches, and notes on challenges and evaluation.              | All phases            |
| Programme resources created | Varied (see Chapter 5)              | Materials evolved through participant feedback and facilitator experimentation. Stored digitally.    | All phases            |
| Practitioner interviews     | 4 interviews, around 90 minutes each | Conducted via Zoom. Recorded and stored as video files.                                              | After P3              |
| Participant interviews      | 4 interviews, around 90 minutes each | One via Zoom, three captured using screen recording to prompt reflection on games and artefacts.     | After P3              |

Journal notes were kept throughout the process in both paper and digital formats. These notes included session reflections, design challenges, and links to emerging themes in the literature. Alongside this, I archived the digital resources used in each phase, including templates, guides, and materials created by the young participants. The games themselves were treated as a form of data. This was partly informed by activity theory's emphasis on tools as culturally mediated artefacts, and by the principle of double stimulation, where learners appropriate and repurpose tools for their own ends.

There were practical challenges in collecting and maintaining access to these digital artefacts. In 2025, the platform Glitch.com announced it would no longer host user projects[^5]. I responded by downloading HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files for each game, and archiving them in a Git repository. While some projects created in Piskel were lost, many had been exported in advance and could be preserved. Game data was also stored offline to protect against future platform issues.

Video data played a key role in capturing situated activity. Flashback Pro was chosen for screen capture due to its accessibility and compatibility with home computers. The software recorded user input and screen activity, but to make the files usable in coding software like NVivo, they had to be converted from `.fbr` to `.mp4` format. This conversion process removed some data, such as mouse and keyboard events. I avoided using webcams as they were more intrusive and would have required additional technical management. Instead, the 360 camera was placed centrally in the room, capturing whole-group interaction without fragmenting the learning space.

Managing this data involved careful planning. The large video files required consistent naming and regular backups. The 360 recordings were particularly complex, sometimes split into segments that made time navigation difficult. Specialised software from the camera manufacturer was needed to process the raw footage. To address these challenges, I developed a Linux-based workflow for organising and processing video and audio data, which is included in the technical appendix.

Participant and practitioner interviews took place after Phase 3. These were semi-structured and conducted online due to practical and, at times, COVID-related constraints. While the interviews were not fully transcribed, key sections were reviewed and analysed in combination with other data. Participants were sometimes asked to revisit their games during the interview to support reflection on design choices and problem-solving strategies.

Interviewees included Saskia Leggett, a researcher involved in the Creative Family Learning programme; Matt Curinga, an academic and educator active in community-based coding projects; Dave Potts, a professional programmer and long-term CoderDojo volunteer; and James Clegg, a PGCE computing student who had also supported sessions in person.

## Data analysis process

The analysis was structured in three stages to reflect the evolving relationship between the data and the research questions. This staged approach allowed for an iterative process: beginning with exploratory review, progressing through thematic refinement and methodological adjustment, and concluding with interpretive consolidation. Each stage responded to new insights and practical constraints, and together they represent a strategy for understanding how learning, agency, and contradiction played out within the CGD&P interventions.

Due to the exploratory nature of the research and the openness to emergent directions, the analysis process evolved iteratively across multiple stages. For the purposes of clarity, this process is presented in three simplified stages that reflect broad shifts in focus and method. Each stage marks a move toward greater granularity, using different analytical strategies suited to the emerging needs of the study. This structure also proved particularly useful in managing the large volume of video and screen capture data generated during the CGD&P sessions.

The table below provides a cross-reference between the research questions, the types of data collected, and the analytical and theoretical approaches employed. It serves as a conceptual map to clarify how each question was addressed through the methodological process described in this chapter.

### Stage 1 - Exploratory analysis

Stage 1 served as a exploratory review of the dataset to assess data quality, relevance, and initial themes. This included reviewing researcher journals, practitioner interviews, and preliminary video footage to develop a sense of the emerging pedagogical and methodological issues. The goal was to understand the types of contradictions and learning behaviours present, and to inform the next steps for more focused analysis. This phase aimed to determine which datasets merited deeper analysis and refine the methodological processes for subsequent analytical stages, aligning with approaches of iterative refinement in DBR [@bikner-ahsbahs_introduction_2015-1].

The process was initially driven by the need to produce a summary of the facilitation process and to surface contextual tensions for a book chapter [@chesterman_game_2023], as well as to contribute to a mapping of learning dimensions developed during the D3 phase[^6] for online resource design . Journal analysis provided a foundational perspective on facilitation and early thematic tensions. Given the breadth of journal data, a comprehensive thematic analysis and exhaustive coding was impractical; instead, insights were triangulated with findings from the literature review to expose key themes and contradictions in the evolving pedagogy. Rogoff’s [-@rogoff_observing_1995] three planes of sociocultural activity were particularly useful here, allowing reflections on facilitation to be categorised across personal, interpersonal, and institutional dimensions, a technique further refined by Morcom [-@morcom_scaffolding_2014]. Alongside journal entries, evolving teaching resources, participant-created games, and assets  were examined to provide insight into how learners engaged with design elements, navigated  constraints, and appropriated resources for their own purposes. The use of these materials  informed subsequent iterations of facilitation and resource development, and contributed to  the emergent facilitation strategy.




Practitioner interviews were used alongside journal reflections to identify key pedagogical concerns, barriers to participation, and evolving priorities within the learning design. Four extended interviews (averaging 90 minutes each) were conducted with professionals and collaborators from overlapping fields. The semi-structured format allowed for responsive dialogue, helping to surface themes such as learner identity, creative constraint, scaffolding strategies, and the design tensions in non-formal learning contexts. Themes included: agency as a focus, which emerged from Dave Potts’ reflections on the value of surfacing and supporting participants’ own interests in digital making; the value and tensions surrounding competition in non-formal settings, raised by Matt Curringa; the helping roles played by parents in young people's engagement with technology, highlighted by Saskia Leggett; and the affordances of online toolkits and game mechanics as mediational strategies, discussed by James Clegg. These interviews also helped focus subsequent cycles of video analysis by informing early coding directions and refinement of the research questions.

Finally, video data was explored through a broad review of selected screen capture and 360-degree recordings from P2, P3, and P4. This initial dip into the video archive was used to assess both the quality and analytic potential of the recordings. Observations were recorded using a spreadsheet format and structured around Rogoff’s [@rogoff_observing_1995] three-plane framework. This approach provided an initial sense of the rhythms of sessions, the emergence of roles, and the unfolding of mediational practices. At this stage, full transcription was not attempted; instead, time-stamped observations helped determine which sessions might warrant deeper analysis in subsequent stages.



This first stage set the foundation for the later interpretive work by clarifying the practical constraints of the data, surfacing early thematic directions, and testing the viability of a multi-source, iterative approach.



### Stage 2 – Thematic Refinement

The second stage of analysis began with the intention of developing a structured coding schema that could support both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Inspired by a desire to systematically compare themes across video data, interviews, and journals, the original plan involved using NVivo (a qualitative-first data analysis software that also supports mixed-methods queries) to apply a consistent thematic structure, combining insights from the literature, practitioner interviews, and preliminary analysis. NVivo allows researchers to apply codes across datasets and run queries, for example to examine how much time participants spent on specific tasks or how often particular behaviours occurred [^7].

However, as the coding process began, a number of challenges arose. Technically, NVivo struggled to handle the extended screen and 360-degree video files smoothly. Syncing multiple video streams, switching between screen capture and wide-view footage, and viewing timestamps simultaneously became cumbersome [^8]. At one point, a workaround using VLC Player allowed for dual playback, and time-coded observations were trialled using five-minute transcription segments imported into Word and then into NVivo. But even this solution remained resource-intensive and prone to breakdown. The complexity of comparing behaviours across screen and 360 recordings also made queries and coding comparisons inconsistent or difficult to manage.

These frustrations coincided with more conceptual questions. It became clear that applying a fixed coding frame would risk obscuring key features of the learning environment, particularly the emergent, improvisational, and tool-mediated aspects of learner agency. Some candidate codes, such as computational thinking, were deprioritised due to either their conceptual overlap with existing literature or a lack of richness in the CGD&P data. Other categories, such as game design stages, became harder to apply consistently across groups and sessions. A rigid schema, in this case, risked flattening what was most interesting: the improvised use of resources, peer scaffolding, and negotiation of meaning in action.

The shift from planned coding to a more interpretive, emergent strategy was not abrupt; it evolved through repeated attempts to organise, code, and revisit earlier transcripts. The use of Rogoff’s three planes of analysis (personal, interpersonal, and cultural) became increasingly helpful as a scaffolding framework. Instead of developing a strict taxonomy, the process moved towards memoing, sketching, and thematically clustering insights using Word documents. These techniques allowed a more flexible and responsive mode of interpretation that could adjust to the complexity of participant behaviour, tool use, and social interaction.

To manage the scope of analysis, ten sessions were selected for deeper review. Criteria included clarity of audio and visuals, richness of peer and facilitator interaction, and representation of different phases of the intervention. In practice, most of the analysis focused on data from phases P2 and P3, as these contained the richest examples of interaction. One session from the end of P2, in particular, stood out due to the complexity of collaboration and the variety of participant roles observed. Transcripts were created in five-minute intervals, pairing 360-degree footage with screen recordings. These were not fully coded line-by-line, but were annotated descriptively with researcher memos noting tensions, tool use, gestures, and participant roles. In some cases, episodes were flagged for deeper treatment in later vignette analysis.

A sample spreadsheet of analysis structured using Rogoff’s three planes is included in the appendix, along with a word-processed document representing one screen capture recording. In this context, the term refers to a segment of recorded participant activity captured via screen recording, typically involving one learner or a pair working at a laptop during a broader workshop session.

While NVivo was initially used to trial some of this coding process, its limitations ultimately led to the adoption of Word-based transcription and thematic logging. This shift reflected a broader methodological commitment: staying close to the activity as it unfolded, rather than forcing it into predefined analytic categories. The process of trying, adapting, and discarding coding strategies also mirrored the study’s broader design ethos, where tools and structures evolved in response to emergent practice instead of being imposed from above.

As new patterns emerged, such as the significance of game design patterns in shaping learner trajectories or the role of peers and parents in scaffolding complex actions, the original research questions were refined. This phase helped surface key areas for Stage 3, including clusters of agency, mediational strategies, and participant repertoires. It also clarified which transcripts and artefacts were most generative for deep, vignette-style interpretation. By the end of this stage, the goal had shifted decisively away from quantifying learning behaviours and toward richly describing how learners appropriated tools and reshaped their participation. What began as a trial of software and schema evolved into a process of conceptual grounding through situated observation and practical compromise.


### Stage 3 – Interpretive Consolidation

The third and final stage of analysis focused on consolidating insights through detailed, interpretive work. Building on the broad mapping of Stage 1 and the thematic refinement of Stage 2, this phase returned to key segments of data selected for their richness, complexity, and relevance to the evolving research questions. The goal was to generate grounded, contextualised understandings of learner agency, design mediation, and pedagogical interaction through the construction of vignettes.

This stage centred on ?six? key vignettes drawn from screen capture and 360-degree video recordings. These were chosen for their representation of diverse learner roles, visible design decision-making, and interactional dynamics. Full transcriptions were produced for these segments, integrating verbal dialogue, on-screen activity, and embodied communication such as gestures and movement within the learning space. At my second formal review, my supervisor Ricardo Nemirovsky encouraged a more deliberate integration of gesture analysis. Viewing the 360 footage alongside the screen capture recordings proved essential in several cases, especially where participants referenced their physical environment or used gesture to support peer explanation. Gestures were also used often to communicate planned  game movements on screen, or for other on-screen actions or procedures, e.g in Vignette x, indication of action of cropping an image.

These vignettes were not designed to be representative in a statistical sense, but to offer rich accounts of how specific learners or pairs navigated their tools, peers, and task structures. Each vignette was treated as an episode that could inform the research questions, including how learners asserted agency, interpreted guidance, or adapted resources. Where possible, these micro-analyses were triangulated with post-session interview data, artefacts (such as games created), and reflective journal entries made immediately after facilitation.

#### GDPs as a germ cell in design and analysis

A key focus during this stage was to examine the ways game design patterns (GDPs) user employed as mediational strategies. A spreadsheet of thematic codes, begun in Stage 2, was extended to cluster GDP use more systematically across planes of activity (individual, interpersonal, and cultural). Patterns of adaptation and reinterpretation were particularly salient, as learners often modified a pattern’s purpose or linked it to emergent gameplay goals. These shifts were interpreted through a CHAT lens as evidence of agency enacted through tool transformation and appropriation. The findings of this process are described in Chapter 6.


This study identifies gameplay design patterns (GDPs) as a germ cell concept within its methodological and analytical framework. Chapter 4 outlines the development of this concept and its structuring role in the design; Chapter 5 traces how GDPs were introduced and iteratively embedded in response to practical contradictions; and Chapter 6 explores how they mediated participation, creativity, and collaboration across different episodes of activity.

Drawing on principles from third-generation activity theory and design-based research, the process of rising to the concrete is used both analytically and pedagogically. In seeking a germ cell or unit of analysis, the researcher attends to complex, evolving activity to identify a minimal yet generative concept that can support expansive development. 3GAT distinguishes between empirical abstraction, such as categorising observed features of activity, and theoretical abstraction, which helps explain or guide transformation. The identification of GDPs as a germ cell falls into the latter category [@sannino_activity_2011, p.590]. In line with understandings of DBR research outputs, the identification of guiding principles to address tension in the table above, would be expressed as a set of "tentative generalisations" in the form of design heuristics drawn from the analysis of the concrete practices observed [@hoadley_design-based_2022, p.215].

GDPs are understood here not only as practical design elements but also as conceptual tools that link participant action, shared language, and the structure of the learning environment. Their recurring role in shaping trajectories of participation positioned them as an increasingly central organising feature. As the learning environment evolved, pedagogical structures were developed around progressively more complex engagements with GDPs. These supported varied forms of learner participation while maintaining coherence and a manageable technical scope.

Rather than introducing entirely new materials at each phase, the learning design was structured to allow for deepening engagement with GDPs over time. This enabled participants to recognise, use, and eventually adapt or create gameplay patterns, supported by different forms of documentation. From a methodological perspective, the germ cell framing helped interpret how tools and resources mediated activity at different levels of granularity, from individual design actions to broader shifts in the object of community practice.

As later chapters show, GDPs were not fixed instructional tools but mutable artefacts shaped in and through practice. Their value lay not only in the structures they provided but in how they were interpreted, adapted, and occasionally resisted by participants. This reinforced the germ cell’s analytical utility—not as a static unit, but as a dynamic mediator of developmental possibility. Framing GDPs in this way helped make visible the shifting relationship between individual action, shared artefacts, and the broader activity system over time.

#### Analysing learner agency

In parallel, the concept of learner agency was refined through a return to participant action across different learning contexts. Gestural and embodied data played a key role here, with several vignettes including analysis of how learners moved around the room, negotiated turn-taking, or used physical props alongside digital tools. These embodied interactions were interpreted as expressions of how agency was enacted, co-constructed, and at times constrained within the learning environment.

The final phase of analysis examined how learners asserted influence over their trajectories, tools, and social roles. Agency was treated as relational and distributed, shaped by how participants appropriated resources, collaborated with others, and navigated tensions or uncertainty. This included attention to gesture, humour, spatial positioning, narrative framing, and tool access.

The analysis focused on how participants engaged with the learning environment to make meaningful choices, express identities, and adapt design pathways. This involved tracking participant interactions across tools, roles, and physical or social settings. These patterns were interpreted through close examination of video, dialogue, and observational notes, forming the basis for later thematic and theoretical development.

Thematic interpretations related to identity, participation, and constraint are developed in greater depth in Chapter 7, where learner agency is explored as both a relational and developmental process.

This interpretive work aimed to clarify not only how the learning environment supported certain forms of agency and design fluency, but also what constraints remained. In some vignettes, learners struggled to access tools or articulate their ideas, prompting reflections on equity, inclusion, and the role of facilitation. These observations informed both the final conceptual model, developed in Chapter 7, and ongoing questions about how pedagogical environments can be designed to support participation across multiple modes and identities.

By the end of this stage, the analysis had shifted from mapping general trends to closely engaging with specific examples that embodied tensions and possibilities within the CGD&P project. These vignettes became the foundation for articulating the study’s contributions to both theory and practice.


### Ethical considerations and validity

Ethical approval for this study was obtained through the ESRI ethics process using the ETHOS system. Participants were recruited via outreach to home education networks, coding events and community meet-ups. Inclusion criteria included being part of a family unit (including guardians) with the ability to travel to the Manchester Metropolitan University campus. Participating families included children aged approximately 7 to 13, and all participants needed to have sufficient English literacy to engage with written materials and communication. An expressed interest in learning to make digital games together as an educational project was also required.

Consent and assent processes were tailored to suit different participant groups, including home-educating families, children and university students. For children, assent was negotiated through informal discussion followed by a simple written agreement, and parents remained nearby or directly involved throughout. DBS-checked adult facilitators and volunteers supported sessions, and alternative activities were always available so that children could opt out at any time. These steps aimed to protect participant autonomy while recognising the relational dynamics of informal learning settings.

While data collection involved video and screen recordings that could not be fully anonymised at source, all analytic materials and outputs used pseudonyms, removed or obscured identifying visuals. The raw video data was stored on a password-protected external computer drive, separate from other working research data. Only the lead researcher had direct access to this material, although the ethics approval process stated that project supervisors could be given access on request.

Addressing validity of data interpretation, the analysis of this research has prioritised ecological validity by studying interactions that emerged in authentic, practice-based contexts, rather than in controlled or experimental conditions. In addition this study adopted a critical stance on objectivist notions of validity, drawing on DBR and activity theory traditions that position the researcher as an active participant in meaning-making. Validity was approached through triangulation across media data formats such as video, interviews, journals and supporting resources, and supported by ongoing reflection and iterative analysis. Following the transformative activist stance [@stetsenko2020radical], validity in this study is grounded in my ethical and practical engagement with participants, and in the co-construction of knowledge aimed at transforming learning relationships and tools. In this process, autoethnographic reflections played an important role. While not directly analysed alongside participant data, these notes informed the design of resources and facilitation strategies. Selected of journal notes  are included in Appendix 4.x [^9] as evidence of the evolving researcher-practitioner role.

### Generalisability and Replication

This study does not aim to generalise in a statistical sense. Instead, it supports transferability of insights and replication of tools and design elements. Project artefacts, including template resources, facilitation guides and open-source tools, are included in the appendices and online repositories. These were created with adaptability in mind, particularly for informal learning contexts or community-led education.

Chapter 5 extends the idea of replication through a design narrative, outlining how tools, materials and pedagogical structures evolved in response to emerging contradictions. This narrative reflects the ethos of DBR by documenting iterative and context-responsive design decisions that may be useful to others working in similar settings.

Turning the replicability of the methodology more broadly, the blend of methods and ethos outlined in this chapter is a potential contribution back to the DBR and CHAT community.

Rather than following an established applied CHAT methodology like the Change Laboratory, I synthesise different concepts outlined in this chapter. Chapter 4, which describes the methodology in more detail, will explain how I draw on CHAT, DBR, and Rogoff's concept [-@rogoff_observing_1995] of the three foci of analysis. In the analysis, I focus on the tensions between system elements, the iterative processes used to address these tensions, and transformational concepts of agency.

This methodology pays particular attention to the development of the artefacts and processes developed as part of the learning design as a form of evidence of these transformations. The more rapid iterations of design align to a greater extent to DBR process of than that of Change Laboratory.

Despite this, this study does aim for a full application of the stricter interpretation of the term formative intervention as outlined by Engeström and Sannino [-@engestrom_methodological_2014]. This hybrid approach addresses a key critique of the Helsinki school's implementation of third-generation activity theory (3GAT) via formative interventions such as the Change Laboratory, specifically that it is time-consuming and requires stable stakeholders [@spinuzzi_trying_2020-1]. However, while this hybrid process has proven fruitful in some areas, it has also posed challenges during the analysis stage. The implications of both successes and challenges are explored in the thesis conclusion.

### Methodological and Practical Limitations

Several limitations shaped the scope of this research. Interview data was limited in number and timing due to logistical constraints and the emphasis on supporting live sessions. More regular or follow-up interviews might have added further depth. Similarly, while significant video data was collected, only a subset was transcribed or coded in detail, reflecting a balance between depth and breadth in analysis.



Demographic information was not formally collected, which limited opportunities to analyse learning in relation to categories such as class, neurodiversity or ethnicity. This reflected a deliberate effort to avoid over-formalising informal learning contexts, but it also constrained the interpretation of inclusion and representation.

Plans for comprehensive coding using NVivo were revised (see Stage 2). Several predefined categories were collapsed or removed, and the process became increasingly interpretive and inductive. This was in line with the study’s broader DBR orientation, where analytical strategies were refined in response to the needs and limitations of the data and context.

The methodological approach combined principles from the Helsinki School’s interpretation of formative intervention with naturalistic methods of observing practice in situ. While not all research decisions can be justified as systematic, they reflect an evolving effort to understand learning as a complex, socially situated process. The design and delivery of the learning intervention itself served as both a context and a method for exploring agency, contradiction and tool use.

The stages of formal analysis started at the end of the phases of delivery. A more accepted process is to undertake some formal analysis between each phases.

The role of the researcher as facilitator, designer and analyst brought both opportunities and risks. Some decisions were intuitive, shaped by prior experience in digital learning facilitation. While this raises questions of objectivity, the Transformative Activist Stance frames such positioning not as bias but as part of a legitimate  commitment to utilitarian change. Autoethnographic materials trace the development of the intervention and the researcher’s own evolving perspective. These are included to support transparency rather than as direct data sources.

### Wider Limitations

Following the guidance of Thompson [@thomson_category_2024]
wider limitations are included in this chapter rather than the concluding chapter, as a way to avoid reducing the narrative flow and impact of those conclusions.

The greatest limitation is the lack of focus on the impact or efficacy of the intervention on any particular aspect of the map of learning dimensions. CT, Ssytems thinking, use of coding constructions.
Such a focus would require either a deeper dive into existing data or ideally collecting a new data in a further iteration which also featured additional methods to triangulate understandings of the concepts and processes that were the subject of study. ADD A FOOT NOTE HERE WITH EXAMPLES? For example, how effective was the intervention

Such an approach here was not taken based on early and sustained guidance from multiple supervisors and follows the more general advice of Bakker on formulating DBR research questions.

Bakker offers guidance in the formulation of research questions in DBR studies which are relevant to this thesis [@bakker_design_2018]. He promotes HOW and WHAT CONSIDERATIONS formulation of question to be represent the exploratory nature of DBR approaches and to increase the possibility of possible generalisation without over promising in terms of projecting beyond the embedded nature of the findings as embedded in the context of the study.

Limitations of the data collected in P4 and P5 were practical in scope due to the room being used and the existing amount of data.

In addition, a comparison of the different toolsets being used could be potentially instructive. HOW?

### Chapter conclusion

This chapter has outlined the methodological framework that underpins the study, combining a staged analytical process with reflexive and design-based strategies. Emphasis has been placed on the evolving nature of the research design, and on the relationships between analysis, tool development and facilitation practice.


To situate the reader at this stage, concepts related to the methodological approach explored in this chapter are briefly outlined in the context of this study. Figure 3.broad below presents a broader picture of the activity within the context of other activity systems.

Fig 3.broad - environmental positioning with game making activity mediating the interactions between stakeholders.

The representation above shows a relation between systems which allows transmission of funds of knowledge and existing repertoires of communication from the existing   activity systems of different stakeholders and learning contribution to a new, emerging system. Following an approach taken by Lecusay [-@lecusay_telementoring_2015], the processes at work in the emerging shared object merits examination as an activity system in their own rights a process tackled in chapter five.

The next chapter builds on this foundation by tracing the co-development of the CGD&P programme over time. Using a design narrative approach IS THIS EXPLORED? [@hoadley_method_2002], Chapter 5 explores how emerging contradictions within the learning environment shaped key shifts in goals, resources and the collaborative object of the game-making intervention.
