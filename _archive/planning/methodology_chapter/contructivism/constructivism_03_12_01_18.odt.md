 Constructivism and Complex Learning Environments =================================================

This writing covers the foundations and characteristics of the learningtheory of constructivism and explores its relevance to understandingcomplex learning ecologies, such as my study interest of digital gamemaking in intergenerational environments.

Foundations of constructivism-----------------------------

The foundations of constructivism can be usefully contrasted tobehavioural and cognitive learning theories through the lens of theconcept of objectivism. Objectivism in a philosophical context can bedescribed as viewing the reality as external to and independent of thehuman mindJonassen,1991). Applied to a learning context, the behavioural school uses thisperspective to justify for a focus on direct instruction as knowledgesuits direct transmission. Effective learning then is the maximisationof fidelity to the original knowledge which can be tested withoutrecourse to examining the processes of the mind.

While, the cognitive school began to explore mental processes, oftenusing a metaphor of mind as computer. Concepts of informationprocessing, memory and cognitive load became prevalent. Bruner, apioneers of the cognitive movement later questioned the overreliance oncomputer metaphors and subsequent implications for application ineducationBruner,1990). His concern is that the specialisation of cognitivists oninformation capabilities of the mind was detractive from exploring its'meaning-making' capabilities1990,p. 2).

This constructivist focus on meaning-making and a view of knowledge asconstructed rather than received a philosophical break from anobjectivist world, one with significant implications to the design oflearning environmentsJonassen,1991). The foundations of constructivism are outlined in the followingsection.

Outline of key concepts of constructivism-----------------------------------------

To best explore implications for education of a constructivistperspective, fundamental concepts of the theory should be examined. Thisprocess is made more complex by the varieties of schools ofconstructivism. Palincsar explores a tentative spectrum, with aconstructivism rooted in a social construction of reality at one end anda more individually focused view of the construction of knowledge at theother1998).Phillips proposes a three dimensional model of divergences, extendingthe individual/ social focus to incorporate dimensions of publicknowledge and radical nature of knowledge construction, concepts whichare explored in context later in this writingDerry,1996).

Despite this variety, overarching themes of a constructivist view oflearning can be identified. The work of Grabinger and colleagues oncreating rich environments for active learning is instructive in thisaspectGrabingerand Dunlap, 1995; Grabinger et al., 1997).

When describing common features of constructivism, Grabinger and Dunlapidentify three characteristics; knowledge is cumulative and a result ofactive processes, context is used by individuals to personaliseknowledge and the importance of collaboration and social negotiation ofmeaning. These themes are now explored in more depth.

Active nature of knowledge creation

The interrelated concepts of puzzlement, perturbment and disequilibriumare used to explore the active view of knowledge construction prevalentin constructivist theory . Piaget described knowledge is an activeprocess where the learner constructs knowledge using evolving cognitivestructures. In his view dis-equilibrium occurred when mental structureswere no longer viable for the learner in response to new experiences.Piaget referred to these structures as schema, which can be described asmental frames grouping together understanding of and reactions to aroundconcepts and situations. Piaget's understanding of schema can becontrasted to a more inclusive definition favoured in informationprocessing / cognitive science circles were schemas are smaller in scopeand including memory objects and mental modelsDerry,1996).

Schema facilitate the processing and storing of information. Whenexperiences being processed is experienced as in 'dis-equilibrium' withexisting schema, then a process of 'accommodation' is said to happen,resulting in an updated and more complex schema. Experiences not incontradiction with the existing schema, are integrated in a processPiaget described as 'assimilation'. Von Glasefeld highlights theinaccuracy of a view of assimilation as a passive process where schemataare seen as a containers for knowledgevonGlasersfeld, 1998). Instead Piaget's conception of a schema as a'cohesive, repeatable action sequence'1952,p. 240) is emphasised. The concept of viability introduced to clarifythat the restructuring of the schema does not bring the learner closerto an objective reality but one which can be said to be more 'viable'within the learners social contextvonGlasersfeld, 1998, p. 9)

The active process of knowledge creation is also identified by Duffy andSavery who redefine Piaget's dis-equilibrium as puzzlement and citevonGlaserfeld's assertion that the people and environment surrounding usprovide the greatest source of such perturbationvonGlasersfeld, 1998). The importance of context is explored in the nextsection.

Situated nature of knowledge creation

In the framework of constructivism, knowledge is viewed as situated,that is, knowledge best is linked with specific and authenticcontextsCollinset al., 1988). Brown and colleagues talk of 'inert knowledge'accumulated by learners able to perform , for example, rotetransformations of figures with out the ability to use such proceduresusefully in the context from which they are derived1989,p. 33). Inert knowledge can be compare to learning concepts viaauthentic contexts and associated tools which they assert allows aricher, more complex understanding and reproducibility of knowledge. Theauthours describe an indexicalising of knowledge, reflecting a complexconstruction of links between context and the mental models constructed,thus a similar context require to allow reapplication or reuse of thelearning. The primacy of context has wide ranging implications forlearning environments which are explored in the final section of thiswriting.

Collaboration and social negotiation of meaning

The importance of context forms a foundation for a further strand ofconstructivism identified by Grabinger, the socially negotiated natureof knowledge and the importance of collaboration in the process. Theseconcepts are now briefly explored through an examination of fundamentalconcepts of the sociocultural theory of Vygotsky and its influence onthe wider the cultural-historical school of psychologyPalincsar,1998).

For Vygotsky the role of context is extended beyond its impact on the(acknowledged) internal construction of knowledge of individual toencompass the joint creation of a cultural context by its participantsColeand Wertsch, 1996). For example, the previously mentioned concept ofviability depends on the existence of a social environment which allowsthe relative testing of such viability. This environment, and itsassociated tools, norms and processes are socially constructed throughon-going negotiation and active participation of its participants.

These tools and processes are referred to as artefacts. The interactionof present and past participants are seen to create historical andcultural artefacts that compose authentic environments and thuspossibility for deep, contextualised learningBrownet al., 1989). The view of tools and symbolic artefacts as mediating thelearning process is key to a constructivist view of higher mentalprocesses, such as language use or problem solvingColeand Wertsch, 1996; Cunningham and Duffy, 1996; Vygotsky, 1978). Thiscontinued co-construction of the learning environment has significantimplications for educational design which are explored in the followingsection.

Application of concepts to educational settings-----------------------------------------------

In Duffy and Cunningham's exploration of the implications ofconstructivist approach on the design of educational environments,concepts and responses of interest they identify include; discoverylearning, zone of proximal development. scaffolding, cognitiveapprenticeship, coaching, learner control, assessment and collaborativelearning1996).

Since initial interest of constructivist concepts they have beenevaluated and recombined in a number of responses and frameworks. Manyresearchers have integrated and evolved aims from the fieldInstructional (Systems) Design to create a rich seam of literature andstudies around constructivist learning environments and their thepossibilities offered by emerging tools and technologiesJonassenet al., 1996; Jonassen and Mandl, 1990; Mcmahon, 1997; Wilson, 1996).

Given the focus of my study on complex, collaborative learningenvironments, I have selected the following to explore in more detail inthis section; learner control, context (including discovery learning),collaborative learning. I will draw on this seam literature to provideexamples

Learner Control

Duffy and Cunningham initially situate learner control through the lensof computer enhanced instruction. Learner control can be contrasted tocomputer control. Learners control the sequence of information andtasks.

Wilson characterises constructivist learning environments as opensystems where learner choice is emphasisedWilson,1995). However, rather than deemphasising the importance of teacher ordesigner input, he asserts that this open nature can tend to chaos andeventually de-motivation of learners and thus good design is needed ineach component of that system and in the linkages to help maintainlearner activityWilson,1995).

Hannafin and Lee identify student autonomy as a key factor in learnermotivation, performance and creativity, as outlined by selfdetermination theoryDeciand Ryan, 2000; Lee and Hannafin, 2016). The identify student centre

Authentic Contexts

Given the constructivist understanding of the indexical nature ofknowledge and effective recall, learning contexts should be as close orideally identical to the target domain of use of the skills being learntBrownet al., 1989). Beyond the cognitive motivations for this fidelity toreality, Grabinger and Dunlap cite advantages of increased studentownership of challenges addressed and that genuine challenge in teamwork encourages desireable student 'collaboration and negotiation'1995,p. 21).

The importance of authentic context presents a challenge to classroombased instruction that many initiatives attempt to overcome. Theseinclude the creation of simulations, dynamic case-studies inProblem-based learning,

Duffy and Cunningham are critical of learning methods includingcognitive apprenticeship that while aiming to provide proximity to anauthentic context, focusing on a transmission from master to apprenticerather than a more mutual learning process that genuine participation acommunity would enableCunninghamand Duffy, 1996; Wenger, 1998).

While this mutually can certainly be seen as advantageous, it appears tome conterproductive to negate non-optimal learning environments for twopragmatic reasons. Firstly, as the artificially of most learningenvironments, necessitated by an erosion of community infrastructure andincreasingly professionalised working conditions prevent suchintegration of diverse learners. Secondly, if we grant the faciltator ofa teacher-learner oversight into the two way nature of a dialogicprocess, then mutual learning will occur in any case.

Collaborative Learning

The importance of a collaborative approach to learning is supported byone of Vygotsky's key theory, that of the zone of proximal developmentVygotsky,1978).

The nature of social learning as based on dialogue is made fruit throughthe use of collaborative learning, in many cases group work.

Conclusion / Implications for designing a learning environment--------------------------------------------------------------

In a poetic introduction to Constructivist Learning Environments,Perkins describes neighbourhood knowledgeWilson,1995). He outlines a depth of local knowledge concerning where to findthings, who to talk to to find out certain information which mirrors thedepth of knowledge described above.

To address learning which goes beyond a totally naturalistic approach,in the case of my study how to set up a learning environment whichsupports the nurturing of a game making community, we can take on boardkey observations in terms of design choices, and the pitfalls to avoid.

At this point I also want to draw new conclusions on a previous piece ofwriting on constructionism. Proponents of constructionism present it asa new theory which extends constructivism with a novel focus on thevalue of the production of external objects in a context that valuessocial sharing of them. I would take issue with this and characterise itas a subset of constructivism as to do otherwise negates thecontribution of Vygotsky and the following school

In this aspect, while not devaluing th contribution of constructionisms,I would like to invoke diSessa and Cobb's distinction between grandtheories (constructivism) and narrower theories focused on effectiveapplication to learning environments (in this case constructionism)DiSessaand Cobb, 2004).
