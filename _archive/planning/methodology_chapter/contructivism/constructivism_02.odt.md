 Constructivism and Complex Learning Environments =================================================

My study interest is in learning surrounding digital game making inintergenerational environments. This writing covers the foundations andcharacteristics of the learning theory of constructivism and exploresits relevance to understanding such complex learning ecologies.

Foundations of constructivism-----------------------------

The foundations of constructivism can be usefully contrasted tobehavioural and cognitive learning theories, both of which have anobjectivistic views of the world. Objectivism in a philosophical contextcan be described as viewing the reality as external to and independentof the human mindJonassen,1991). Applied to a learning context, the behavioural school uses thisperspective to justify for a focus on direct instruction as knowledgesuits direct transmission. Effective learning then is the maximisationof fidelity to the original knowledge which can be tested withoutrecourse to examining the processes of the mind.

Bruner and Kant (also in Jonassen)

Kant

While, the cognitive school began to explore mental processes, oftenusing a metaphor of mind as computer, some pioneers of this movementincluding Bruner began to question the effectiveness of this metaphor,conclusions and implications for application in educationBruner,1990).

More on computer metaphor?

His concern is that the specialisation of cognitivists on informationprocessing capabilities of the mind was detractive from exploring its'meaning-making' capabilities1990,p. 2). This focus on meaning-making and a view of knowledge asconstructed rather than received form the foundation of constructivism.The core element of knowledge construction is expanded with furtheranalysis in the following section.

Outline of key concepts of constructivism-----------------------------------------

To best explore implications for education of a constructivistperspective, fundamental concepts of the theory should be examined. Thisprocess is made more complex by the varieties of schools ofconstructivism. Palincsar explores a tentative spectrum, with a radicalconstructivism rooted in a social construction of reality at one end anda move conservative, individually focused view of the construction ofknowledge at the other1998).*(Phillips has a three dimensional model of divergences*[]{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"x6gOX5Uh","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Derry, 1996)","plainCitation":"(Derry, 1996)"},"citationItems":[{"id":4447,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/9RLFJYIF"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/9RLFJYIF"],"itemData":{"id":4447,"type":"article-journal","title":"Cognitive schema theory in the constructivist debate","container-title":"Educational Psychologist","page":"163-174","volume":"31","issue":"3-4","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","abstract":"Cognitive constructivism is not a unique theoretical framework, pedagogical approach, or epistemology, but a general, metaphorical assumption about the nature of cognition that virtually all cognitive educational researchers accept.

It then attempts to represent the range of theoretical approaches within cognitive constructivism, pointing to examples and potential educational applications of cognitive constructivist ideas. Cognitive schema theory receives special attention as an important theoretical perspective that has been relatively neglected in recent theoretical discussions. It is believed to have significant potential for building conceptual bridges between information processing and radical constructivist viewpoints.","DOI":"10.1080/00461520.1996.9653264","ISSN":"0046-1520","author":[{"family":"Derry","given":"Sharon J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",6,1]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDaT6nJLdzMg}*(Derry,1996))*

Despite this variety, overarching themes of a constructivist view oflearning can be identified. The work of Grabinger and colleagues oncreating rich environments for active learning (REALs), which isexamined in more detail in the final section of this writing, isinstructive in this aspectGrabingerand Dunlap, 1995; Grabinger et al., 1997).

Grabinger and Dunlap prioritise three characteristics of constructivism;knowledge is cumulative and a result of active processes, context isused by individuals to personalise knowledge and the importance ofcollaboration and social negotiation of meaning. These themes are nowexplored in more depth with examples and some divergent opinions.

Active nature of knowledge creation

Piaget's work can be seen as a strong influence on constructivisttheory. A significant contribution was his work to support the positionthat knowledge is an active process where the learner constructsknowledge using evolving cognitive structures. Piaget referred to thesestructures as schema and the process of their construction asassimilation of accommodation of information. These terms will now beexplained.

Schema from the Piaget can be described as mental frames groupingtogether understanding around big ideas DEFINE BETTER

Piaget's understanding of schema can be contrasted to a working,inclusive definition favoured in information processing / cognitivescience circles including memory objects and mental modelsDerry,1996).

Their use facilitates processing and storing of information that is notin contradicting with the existing model, a process Piaget described asassimilation. While many see that process as frictionless, von Glasefeldasserts the active nature of the process. CITATION

Conversely, when information being processed is experienced as in'dis-equilibrium' with existing schema, then a process of accommodationis said to happen, resulting in an updated and more complex schema.

There is a debate about weather the social nature or individual focus ofknowledge creation is compatible, pitching Piaget against Vysgotky.While Cobb doesn't see a conflict Duffy does -Cunninghamand Duffy, 1996, p. 6).

The active process of overcoming this conflict is also identified byDuffy & Savery in a review of constructivist viewpointsSaveryand Duffy, 1995). The authors redefine Piaget's dis-equilibrium aspuzzlement and cite vonGlaserfeld's assertion that the people andenvironment surrounding us provide the greatest source of suchperturbationVonGlasersfeld, 1998). The importance of context is explored in the nextsection.

Von Glasersfeld also discusses a useful concept of viability statingthat as the active restructuring of the schema does not bring thelearner closer to an objective reality but it can be said to be moreviable within the learners social contextVonGlasersfeld, 1998)

Situated nature of knowledge creation

The assertion that knowledge is situated in the framework ofconstructivism, can be described more fully as knowledge being linkedwith specific and authentic contexts. Such situated knowledge can becontrasted with knowledge, learnt in decontextualised fashionsCollinset al., 1988). An example of a decontextualised method would be aclassroom instruction of information about a process for the purposes ofexam recall or other forms of learning where the learner is not able toapply knowledge in real situations.

Brown and colleagues talk of 'inert knowledge' accumulated by learnersable to perform , for example, rote transformations of figures with outthe ability to use such procedures usefully in the context from whichthey are derived1989,p. 33). The authours compare this to learning concepts via authenticcontexts and associated tools which they assert allows a richer, morecomplex understanding and reproducibility of knowledge. The process ofbuilding knowledge that can be recalled is described as indexicalisingof knowledge, reflecting a complex construction of links between contextand the mental models constructed which require a similar context to bereapplied by the subject. The primacy of context has wide rangingimplications for learning environments which are explored in the finalsection of this writing.

Collaboration and social negotiation of meaning

The importance of context forms a foundation for the final strand ofconstructivism identified by Grabinger, the socially negotiated natureof knowledge and the importance of collaboration in the process. Theseconcepts are now explored through an examination of fundamental conceptsof the sociocultural theory of Vygotsky and its influence on the widerthe cultural-historical school of psychologyPalincsar,1998).

For Vygotsky the role of context is extended beyond its impact on the(acknowledged) internal construction of knowledge of individual toencompass the joint creation of a cultural context by its participantsColeand Wertsch, 1996). For example, the previously mentioned concept ofviability depends on the existence of a social environment which allowsthe testing of such viability. This environment, and its associatedtools, norms and processes are socially constructed through on-goingnegotiation and active participation of its participants. It is theinteraction of present and past participants to create these historicaland cultural artefacts that creates an authentic environments and thepossibility for deep, contextualised learningBrownet al., 1989).

The importance these tools and symbolic artefacts to mediate thelearning process is key to a constructivist view of higher mentalprocessesColeand Wertsch, 1996; Cunningham and Duffy, 1996).

This continued co-construction of learning spaces has significantimplications for the design of learning environments. There is aninitial exploration of come of the most significant of these in thefollowing section.

Application of concepts to educational settings-----------------------------------------------

Duffy and Cunningham have identified and explored the implications ofconstructivist approach on the design of educational environments .Concepts and responses of interest they identify include; discoverylearning, zone of proximal development. scaffolding, cognitiveapprenticeship, coaching, learner control, assessment and collaborativelearning.

Given the focus of my study on complex, collaborative learningenvironments, I have selected the following to explore in more detail inthis section; learner control, context (including discovery learning),collaborative learning.

Learner Control

Duffy and Cunningham situate learner control through the lens ofcomputer enhased instruction, where the terminology describe control tothe sequence of information and tasks, but also mention student-centredapproaches in non-computer focused environments.

In a review of constructivist learning environments Wilson characterisesthem as open systems where learner choice is emphasised. However, ratherthan demphasising the importance of teacher input, he asserts that thisopen nature can tend to chaos and eventually de-motivation of learnersand thus good design is needed in each component of that system and inthe linkages to help maintain learner activityWilson,1995).

Authentic Contexts

Given constructivism understanding of the indexical nature of knowledgeand effective recall, learning contexts should be as close or ideallyidentical to the target domain of use of the skills being learnt. Beyondthe cognitive motivations for this fidelity to reality, Grabinger andDunlap cite advantages of increased student ownership of challengesaddressed and that genuine challenge in team work encourages desireablestudent 'collaboration and negotiation'1995,p. 21).

The importance of authentic context presents a challenge to classroombased instruction that many initiatives attempt to overcome.

These include the creation of simulations, dynamic case-studies inProblem-based learning,

The prioritisation of is context authenticity, discussed by Duffy andCunningham who are critical of certain learning methods includingcognitive apprenticeship as focusing too much on a transmission frommaster to apprentice and thus not not fitting the more mututal processas suggested by the community of practice model.

While this mutually can certainly be seen as advantageous, it appears tome conterproductive to negate non-optimal learning environments for twopragmatic reasons. Firstly, as the artificially of most learningenvironments, necessitated by an erosion of community infrastructure andincreasingly professionalised working conditions prevent suchintegration of diverse learners. Secondly, if we grant the faciltator ofa teacher-learner oversight into the two way nature of a dialogicprocess, then mutual learning will occur in any case.

Collaborative Learning

The importance of a collaborative approach to learning is supported byone of Vygotsky's key theory, that of the zone of proximal developmentVygotsky,1978).

The nature of social learning as based on dialogue is made fruit throughthe use of collaborative learning, in many cases group work.

Conclusion / Implications for designing a learning environment--------------------------------------------------------------

In introduction to 1996 book Constructivist Learning Environments,Perkins talk about neighbourhood knowledgeMeij,1997; Wilson, 1995). He outlines a depth of local knowledge concerningwhere to find things, who to talk to to find out certain informationwhich mirrors the depth of knowledge described above.

To address learning which goes beyond a totally naturalistic approach,in the case of my study how to set up a learning environment whichsupports the nurturing of a game making community, we can take on boardkey observations in terms of design choices, and the pitfalls to avoid.
