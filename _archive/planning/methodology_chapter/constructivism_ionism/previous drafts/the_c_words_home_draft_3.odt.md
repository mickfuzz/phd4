[]{#anchor}The key word of constructionism is popular when describing game building.

Less so for game playing and making.

What are underpinning concepts of a constructionist approach to game making.

This writing traces the genesis of the term from in Papert's Mindstorm

then explores the foundations of constructionism in the constructivism of Piaget and the landscape at the time of this formation, linking with foundational concepts in the contemporary cognitive revolution

Then the underpinning concepts of constructionism as a teaching and learning theory.

Then explores other uses in more contemporary studies to test of elaborations or deviations of the term

Make this enough of an intro to Papert to justify the journey back to Piaget

Notes on Methodology  ---------------------

If there is space include notes on the research methodology of Piaget, Papert and socio-cultural schools. What does this say about their underlying assumptions. Ackermann addresses this indirectly in her characterisation of the three in Ackermann, n.d.).  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Look at Elemental and Systems based approaches.

Perhaps also look at language compared to mathematics approaches.

Cognitive Foundations ---------------------

-   Summary of Piaget's constructivism -   Background of Constructivism, interactionism, as base -   Key differences in perspective (end with the celebration on concrete     stage)

Ackermann's exploration of the similarities between constructionism and constructivism places Papert's focus on the way learners identify and accommodate new information thus creating new internal representations of the world.

Constructivism** ** -------------------

We can see the Constructionist approach of Papert as rooted in Constructivist learning theories as proposed by Piaget. Constructivism in this context refers to a view of the learning process as an active process where the learner constructs knowledge using evolving cognitive structures. We can examine some of the concepts and background to this school of thought.

We can see Piaget work as intertwined with the a reaction against the limits of Behaviourism seen by many as a Cognitive Revolution Miller, 2003). The behaviourist approach to psychology had a focus on empirical observation of measurable behaviour rather than mental processes and thus took place in strictly controlled environments. In this context the overall tag of cognitive is a signifier for mental activity rejected by Behaviourists.

While positioning the advancement of cognitive approaches as a revolution is in danger of ignoring activity exploring the realms of mental activity in Europe, particularly Gestalt psychology. In the US from 1950s onwards there was a growth of studies with such a cognitive focus on information processing and phenomenology. The research methods used by Piaget of naturalistic observation

Piaget's Constructivism through a Philosophical Lens

Cavet that this area is outside my comfort zone but clearly a more detailed exploration of it is in order as...

Piaget has been interpreted as a realist but this contested highly Richards and Von Glasersfeld, 1980).

Also constructivism is an alternative to both rationalism/nativism and empiricism. <http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_constructivism.html>

There are strong links to Kant in the content

Attempts to place Piaget in a school of philosophy prove elusive as this is not his focus.

Piaget has been credited with evolution of epistemology from a branch of philosophy to as science in its own right.

This tactic is perhaps best illustrated in Piaget's quote "Je m'en fou de la realite" Gruber and Voneche, 1995, p. xxiv). The authors take this to be a reflection on the work Piaget has one in translating difficult ontological questions into epistemological concerns that are more easily

addressed by educators.

However, we do need to explore some underlying philosophical concepts before being able to fully grasp the concept of how knowledge is created. (or do we can they be integrated? - probably as too lengthy otherwise)

-   First, empiricism, (piaget very anti empiricism -- too simplistic),     knowledge isn't transmitted it's constructed) -   Nativism

Underlying Concepts of Piaget's Constructivism

We can then explore the nature of interactionism as an underlying, uncontroversial characteristic shared with other theorists. However for Piaget the process is much more active than for others. A simplistic interaction with environment resulting in frictionless empirical learning is something Piaget would reject.

We can now explore constructivism as an active process involving assimilation, accomodation into evolving structures.

In their initial directions, assimilation and accommodation are obviously opposed to one another, since assimilation is conservative and tends to subordinate the environment to the organism as it is, whereas accommodation is the source of changes and bends the organism to the successive constraints of the environment. Piaget, 2013)

Distinction from strict nativism

We can make a distinction between a progression of underlying structures and stages which the learner is constantly creating and a set of a priori stages which unfurl as the child ages. This distinguishes Piaget's constructivism from a more nativist approach is subtle especially due to Piagets' claim that they are Universal. Rather they are a seen as a logical progression Gruber and Voneche, 1995, p. xxxix).

Overview of Constructionism  ----------------------------

What is is what it is't -- More of a meta theory than a learning theory in itself - Hoban et al., 2010)

Contrasts to pure discovery Kafai, 2014)

Celebrating the Concrete ------------------------

-   Objects to think with -   Bricolage -   Hard and Soft coding approaches.

Papert's interest in the educational value of the production of digital artefacts as objects drove the creation of the LOGO coding language some associated physical tools, notably drawing turtles. For this study Papert's concept of Microworld is of particular interest. Microworlds are designed spaces which act as incubators for certain kinds of learning. His criteria for Microworlds are that they should give examples of the chosen subject learning, bring all needed concepts inside the Microworld and that there should be footholds for the end user to put this kind of learning to use with interaction with the world Papert, 1980, p. 126). It must comply to the learning principle that for a concept to progress beyond making links to your existing knowledge, you must use it, play with it to find out more and assimilate or accommodate your findings into your world view Ackermann, 2001).

Of particular interest to this study are the concept of soft and hard approaches to coding Papert, 1990). Whereas a hard approach infers a top down perspective mirrored by recent conceptions of computational thinking Wing, 2008), soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner directed connection with the materials or digital artefacts involved, a connection evoking Levi Strauss' concept of bricolage 1962).

Physical vs Digital Construction --------------------------------

Change in focus for papert?

Objects that can be shared.

The evolution of practice.

Maker spaces designed to highlight the physical interactions and facilitate peer learning.

Exploring Social aspects of Constructionism -------------------------------------------

Kafai adds in the open windows model

Constructionism and Current Practice ------------------------------------

-   Papert's take in Mindstorm / Children's machine

Resnick et al develop the process of designing a software tool to facilitate a constructivist approach into a framework containing an analogy to building design 2005). Such a tool should have wide walls catering for diverse interests, a low threshold to allow for novices with little technical experience and high ceilings so learners are not restricted by the technical limits of the creative environment as their designs become more complex. * *

*I would develop this more if there were a greater word count to discuss their framework outlined below.\ Immediate Feedback: See the result, see the process\ Fluid Experimentation: Easy to get started, easy to connect,\ Open Exploration: Variety of materials, variety of genres *

Resnick and Rosenbaum also discuss 'tinkering with tinkerability', detailing facilitation guidelines to support the open learning processes. These include; set themes not challenges, highlight diverse examples, tinker with space, encouraging engagement with people, posing questions instead of giving answers and combining diving in with stepping back 2013, pp. 17--19). They identify this as an area for further research.
