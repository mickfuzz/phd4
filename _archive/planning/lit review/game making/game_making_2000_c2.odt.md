An overview of literature on Game Design

My proposed study is on the role of collaboration in digital game makingintergenerational learning contexts. It will therefore require anextensive exploration of the literature concerning game making inlearning, and where with a focus on young people. While my choice to usedigital games, specifically two-dimensional video games as a learningmedium ( a choice justified elsewhere in the study), does effect thefocus of the following exploration of concepts, many of them aretransferrable to non-digital mediums.

As explored in the introductory chapter and previous sections theframeworks of 21^st^ Century skills and Computational Thinking areprevalent in the literatureBrennanand Resnick, 2012; Earp et al., 2012; Grover and Pea, 2013; Wing, 2006).Following a situated learning approach many of these frameworks areintertwined with the tools linked in the studies. Despite, a widediversity in these frameworks and processes, key overarching concernscan be identified (see appendix). What follows is a review focusing thefollowing areas; developing critical literacies, creative designmethodologies, game play and mechanics as systems thinking.

Developing Critical Literacies

Much of the literature exploring literacies and games focuses on theplaying of games, rather than game making, as a medium well suited tothe development of active meaning making in keeping with aconstructivist and situated approach to learningGee,2003; Jenkins, 2008).

Following constructivist principles, we may imagine a higher potentialof game making compared to playing. However, while some authors can seethe value of studying the making games to address 21^st^ century skillsEarpet al., 2013), other advocates are keen to not prioritise making andthus devalue playing elements with an assumption that "to be a fullparticipant, one must alsoproduce."Salen,2007, p. 308).

Conceptual work that has been done around developing multiple literaciesapplies not just to playing but also making. The work of Buckingham andBurn on gaming literacies puts social and cultural context at heart ofthe process.Buckinghamand Burn, 2007). The summary of Critical Framing (Cope and Kalantzisp329) -- supported by Shaffer . Developing metalanguage .

They identify potential problems with the application of existingcritical media theory in terms of there being an over emphasis on .

In identifying that games complicate distinctions between making andconsuming literacies, their study looks to develop a framework on gamemaking literacies the authors explore dimensions of cultural, criticalgame literacies and then creative approaches.

In order to document and assess the kinds of literacies outlined aboveand specifically learning in the development of the software toolGamestar Mechanic, Games proposes a three-dialog model of gamingliteracies2008).Material literacies provide language to address the often complexaffordances of interrelated objects and system components of games, atopic covered on more depth later. The two other dialogues addressperspectives of the real and ideal game players.

In his exploration of literacies surrounding thinking around designinggame for an the the ideal player, Games identifies a key different inthe dialogue surrounding playing and making games. To do this he drawson conceptions of the "virtual, real and projective" identities in gameplayGee,2003, p. 54). The real identies of game players are lost to an extent asthey attempt to play a virtual role. This transformation is not imaginedas complete and thus the merged in a projected identity with elements ofboth real and virtual. In imagining the experience of the ideal player,the games designer addresses issues of interactivity and systemsdynamics. Thus the ideal player is a useful construct to aid design andhelping the designer imagine the virtual player that the real playerwill project themselves into. This shift in perspective has parallelswith the process of designing for others outlined in next sectionKafaiet al., 1997; Owston et al., 2009).

Finally, the real player dialogue comprises feedback from others in thetesting of the designed games. This vital stage begins the movement ofthe game into a wider social ecology. The interaction between designerand real player happens during the testing of game prototyping in aprocess know as play-testing. Again this is detailed in the nextsection.

Games Creative Design Process

\In early work exploring the educational potential of game making usingthe LOGO language, Kafai identifies a convergence of previously separatedomains of design and learning theoriesKafai,1995). Specifically, increased interest in problem and project basedapproaches in education mirror the challenge or brief focused nature ofdesign methods.

The importance of the process of design is covered in many foundationalstudies on game making. Salen highlights the value of prototypes in gamedesignSalen,2007). Both Salen and Kafai cite the influence on the field of theprocess of reflection in action and the value of iteration, both keyconcepts of the work of Schön1984).In this context, these concepts position the game maker a reflexiveindividual in a social context of a wider game making community creatingon-going test designs which are given feedback and modified further in aiterative process.

The development of the Adventure Author 3D narrative game developmenttool prompted research to understand of the discreet stages of creativeprocessRobertsonand Nicholson, 2007). These are outlined as; exploration, ideageneration, game design, game implementation, game testing andevaluation were drawn from a mix of design fields including generalcreative process support, commercial game design and software design.While analysis of these stages can yield important stages of processesincluding problem finding, problem-solving, evaluation, communicationand collaboration, there is also a recognition the tension between theutility of this presentation discreet stages and the iterative nature ofthe process.

Iteration is at the heard of Resnick's model for creative design whichwas created in parallel with the Scratch tool.Resnick,2008, 2007). Graphical representation of this model explicitly referencethe creative, expanse spiral beginning and ending with Imagine, andfollowed by the stages of create, play, share and reflect.

There is a good overview of the benefits of design in descriptions ofthe learning in the computer clubhouse projectResnickand Rusk, 1996). While this is short of definition this exists in laterwork on computational thinking which is very convincing.

Collaboration

We can argue that collaboration is another tool which is supported bythe design process. Indeed, it would be hard to identify any part of thedesign process does not allow for collaboration. For example in the teamsetting of priorities, prototype creation, peer review process andgiving and receiving feedback. However, while we can draw on otherstudies of project-based approaches to support design processes whichsupport collaborationBereiterand Scardamalia, n.d.; Blumenfeld et al., 1991), Earp and colleaguesnote that studies in collaboration and game making are restricted to theareas of feeback via peer review2013).

The area I am most interested in for this study is collaboration in thecreation of elements of systems thinking. In video games this ismanifested in related concepts of game mechanics and game play. Theinterrelationship between these concepts and studies addressing them arecovered in the following section.

Systems analysis via game mechanics and game play

Gee characterises systems thinking in video games as an analysis of\"relationships, not isolated events, facts, and skills"Gee,2013, p. 12). As part of foundational theory to support the design ofGamestar Mechanic (GSM) Torres identies four main aspects ofunderstanding of systems thinking from the literature; system dynamicsinvolves the ability to recognise when multiple, dynamic relationshipsexist within a system, feedback dynamics requires identification offeedback loops, analysis of the quality of system linkages and theability to identify similar systems in other domainsTorres,2009). In the GSM these foundational concepts using a frameworkconsisting of the key elements of games namely; space, rules, coremechanics, components and goals.

In this work using Gamestar Mechanic, a purpose built, Torres and otherdesigners of the game brings the process of analysing and creating gamemechanics into the realm of a formal learning approach suitable of forformal eduction and after school environments.

Torrest advocates the use of these specialist terms in game creationworkshop early on, even the incorrect use of the these terms to builddevelopment of use in situ to as supported by the work of Hmelo2000).

The work surrounding GSM can be seen as a manifestation within educationof a wider desire to define terms of game design as a means tofacilitate evolution of associated processes and culturesCostikyan,2002).

One of the elements explored is that of *game mechanics.* While a broaddefinition of game mechanics may cover many elements of game play.Sicart finds a more exact definition of game mechanics which excludeselements of rules and player challenges and focuses more on mechanics askey actions that can be carried out by players in a gameplay context .

Following Järvinen (2008), the best way of understanding mechanics asmethods is to formalize them as verbs, with other syntactical/structuralelements, such as rules, having influence on how those verbs act in thegameSicart,2008).

We can compare this compared to game play and how used in quest tolearn.

Another study on deepening understanding and application of gamemechanics looked at children's understanding of game rules form playerand game perspectivesAdamsonet al., 2002).

The effect of systems in a game is described as game play in this studywhich aims to explore game mechanics in video games in order to helpdesignersFABRICATORE,n.d.).

One of the more advanced designs exploring game play and mechanics isQuest to LearnTekinbaş,2011, p. 55). The key learning practices are on page 55 , some overlapwith design and meaning making but some elements first two are reallynovel.

Appendix A

What follow are notes on a quick review of some of the frameworks usedto categorise the game making learning, or the outcomes of studiesexploring the value of digital game making.

A wide literature review identified "seven distinct -- but closelyrelated -- classes: literacies & skill

sets, individual learning attributes, inclusion, pedagogy, socialissues, technology and curriculum."Earp,2015, p. 10).

Other frameworks of gaming literacies exist which have a wider focus oncritical approaches and multiple literacies as well as culturesA.Peppler and B. Kafai, 2009; Buckingham and Burn, 2007). These worksaimed to extend media literacy and production frameworks to thisemerging area.

We can look at the why games arguments of Hayes and Games in theirreview of tools and strategies as a frameworkHayesand Games, 2008). As Kafai and Burke point out their categorisation ofpurpose within 4 sets namely; learning programming, getting girls tocode, learning other subjects by proxy, understanding designing concepts-- is not exhaustive and overlaps, often expresslyBurkeand Kafai, n.d.).

Kafai uses a wider framework for looking at value of constructionistgames -- personal learning, social and culturalKafaiand Burke, 2015). While I can see the value of this encyclopedicappraoch to categorise existing studies, this seems too broad for thepurpose of this review.

What about the "rules, play and culture framework"Salenand Zimmerman, 2003, p. 4).

In this writing, we'll concentrate mostly on rules and play. They notethat the framework can be applied to wider contexts than game design.

Zimmerman later explores , systems, play and designPerronand Wolf, 2009). as gaming literacies,.

There are multiple areas to explore, in this review, given themotivation of developing 21^st^ Century skills, I have prioritised thefollowing;

-   developing critical literacies-   creative design processes-   game play and mechanics as systems thinking
