**Overall on link to main approach **

Constructionism seems great as design guidelines,

Can help with design and environments questions

So reframing research question

Coding In browser, what design benefits? What limits.? Transparency linkto real,

Like tinkering kit

But pAperts Constructionism less strong for social interaction and peerlearning compared to CHAT or COP (situated learning / cognition)

**This leads to a dvevlop**ment in kafai and resnick s version ofconstructionism to include objects to share with.

"For an introduction to objects-to-think-with, see Papert 1980. Forextensions of the concept, see Kafai and Burke 2014. See also Stevens,Boden, and von Rekowski 2013."\\Excerpt From\What Making Video Games Can Teach Us about Learning and Literacy

Contrast the concrete focus of pAperts c word with more inclusive def ofkafai

Personal social and cultural, incorporating design principles

Including computational thinking, not as oppositional.

It is worth noting that the pc is not a tool of wonder or exotic objectfor students nowadays, in many ways it would be negatively viewed fromboring ict classes.

**Indeed** kafai makes this point of computer games in the intro toconnected gaming. Serious games as a consumer product suffer if there islittle novelty.

**On Constructionism**

**Papert** had a plAyful take on not defining constructionism as hewanted readers to construct their own version from the stories hepresented.

(In situating constructionism )

It would be good to take a similar playful approach in writing this. Butmay be trivckty.

**Let's** look at constructionism as others have used it as a frameworkfor investigating game making, kafai, others?

**But so what? Why this as a method? What tools does it provide? Whatelse is there? **

Why apart from the spiritual link back to papert would you keep thisslight extension of constructionism, with the focus on uncoveringmathematical ideas in creative ways?

Much of what he adds in terms of focus. Is heuristic in nature,practical and inspirational in nature rather than addressing underlyingtheory.

In the same way he clelebrates piagets concrete explorations rather thangrand theory, he offers little in this realm.

For resnick and kafai this preserves pAperts leagacy and th3 groundbreaking work and intuitive insights.

However his emergent concerns have been extended in more stystematic wayby other schools in sympathy with pAperts focus.

Sociocultural approaches, activity theory may allow more nuanced studyof interacting activity systems in a project based learning environment.

Flexible and have strong track record.

Situated learning , cop more of a focus on roles, and affinity cultures.Great for the surrounding interactions but maybe less for individuallearners journey. Look at critique of fully decentred situativism interm of cognition. Explore where my line is here.

Good summary of constructivism & social cultural approaches.

Then goes on to contrast ELEMENTAL and SYSTEMs based research.

This is applicable to the approach of Papert in that Ackermann suggestsconstructionism is more focused on the individual.

The research used to support constructionism, while there are somesocial elements, does seems to be individual in nature.

Kafai sees constructivism as more individual and constructionism asfocused on the connected nature of learning, social and personal.

Also contends that constructionism isn't technocentric in approach.However all her examples from this chapter have a tech focus.

Question would be how does constructionism differ from a socialconstructivist approach if not in this more individual and tech centredfocus of its proponents?

Explores the TURTLE and concepts of SYNTONIC tools.

And outlines value of Logo in

-   Learning coding

-   Learning maths

-   Learning metacognition - debugging as an example p. 23 mindstorms

There is debate on the effectiveness of logo for the third,transferrable skills aspect here.

**Piaget** In exploring how constructionism extends constructivism,

**Kafai foregrounds appropriation** - linking with earlier concepts ofobjects to think with and learner projection via syntonic objects.

**Importance of Affect and Embodied understanding (especially inmaths)-** and as an extension -

Papert claims piaget agrees with this importance but just didn't want toproject beyond data here.

**Then importance of the concrete -** rejecting the greater value of theformal stage
