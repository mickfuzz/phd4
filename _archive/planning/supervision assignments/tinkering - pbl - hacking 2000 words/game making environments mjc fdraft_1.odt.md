[]{#anchor}The starting position of this study is that making computergames has great potential supporting a diverse set of competenciesincluding computational practices, team work, problem solving andcritical thinking. Many exciting models of practice exist which have attheir core authentic links with real world issues, complex ecologies ofcooperation and accessible tool sets and practices. An open question toset context is: *What environments exist to facilitate the learning themaking of games in an authentic context in ways that maximise studentcontrol and engagement?*

This opening piece examines some verlapping concepts, environments andprocesses rather than specifics of the tools involved. Due to widefocus, the aim is more to catalogue than to contrast.

When discussing digital game making here, a wide definition is usedwhich includes: creating original games, video game level modding,sand-box games and hardware digital game hybridsGeeand Tran, 2016). Indeed, as Buckingham and Burn point out2007),the difference between making, playing and modding games is oftenblurred.

Constructionism and the legacy of LOGO--------------------------------------

Papert's interest in the educational value of the production of digitalartefacts drove the creation of the LOGO coding language some associatedphysical tools, notably drawing turtles and programmable LEGO. For thisstudy Papert's concept of a microworld is of particular interest.Microworlds are designed spaces which act as incubators for certainkinds of learning. His criteria for microworlds are that they shouldgive examples of the chosen subject learning, bring all needed conceptsinside the microworld and that there should be footholds for the enduser to put this kind of learning to use with interaction with the worldPapert,1980, p. 126). Through the microworld Papert espouses the learningprinciple that for a concept to progress beyond your existing knowledge,you must use it, play with it to find out more, finally assimilating oraccommodating your findings into your world viewAckermann,2001).

Ackermann's exploration of the similarities between constructionism andconstructivism identifies Papert's focus on the way learners identifyand accommodate new information thus creating new internalrepresentations of the world. *There is a lot more to be written in thisarea but I want to move on to more concrete and contemporaryenvironments. *

Of particular interest to this study are the concepts of soft and hardapproaches to codingPapert,1990). Whereas a hard approach infers a top down perspective, onemirrored by recent conceptions of computational thinkingWing,2008), soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner directedconnection with the materials or digital artefacts involved, aconnection evoking Levi Strauss' concept of bricolage1962).

This school of thought and Papert's co-creation of the LOGO language,has been extremely influential in the sphere of teaching STEM and mathsconcepts via computer coding. A significant output of this lineage isthe Scratch visual coding tool and community. The pedagogicalunderpinning of the Scratch project is a reframing of contructionistmethodology as software tinkeringMaloneyet al., 2010; Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013).

Some of the key learning concepts valued in software tinkering are; aplayful and iterative approach, visual methods using code blocks, theability to easily revise aims and a 'bottom-up' construction processwhere small clusters of code blocks are rapidly built, tested and canthen be combined in to larger code structures. Coding concepts are saidto discovered through explorationMaloneyet al., 2010, p. 14).

Resnick et al share their design principles as a framework containing anod to architectural design2005).Software tinkering tools should have wide walls catering for diverseinterests, a low threshold to allow for novices with little technicalexperience and high ceilings so learners are not restricted by thetechnical limits of the creative environment as their designs becomemore complex. * *

*I would develop this more if there were a greater word count to discusstheir framework outlined below.\Immediate Feedback: See the result, see the process\Fluid Experimentation: Easy to get started, easy to connect,\Open Exploration: Variety of materials, variety of genres *

Resnick and Rosenbaum also discuss 'tinkering with tinkerability',detailing facilitation guidelines to support the open learningprocesses. These include; setting themes not challenges, highlightingdiverse examples, tinker with space, encouraging engagement with people,posing questions instead of giving answers and combining diving in withstepping back2013,pp. 17--19). They identify this as an area for further research.

Physical tinkering and making environments------------------------------------------

The keyword tinkering has also gained traction amongst practitioners andresearcher in this domain of physical making. We can contrast the moreexperimental side of the maker movement with the more instructional kitassembly approaches. Repetitive making based on preset instructions ortemptation towards 'trivial fabrication' fails to exploit potentialproblem solving and design challenges latent in the materialsBlikstein,2013; Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013).

Bevan et al propose another perspective which values the potential ofsuch kits to build confidence and technical skills which serve to openfurther possibilities for a more playful and non-directed approach. Theysuggest a learning design strategy of alternating between fabricationand tinkeringBevanet al., 2014).\\Let us examine in detail a study by Bevan et al on the creation of aframework to evaluate learning through tinkering in a museum settingBevanet al., 2015). The authors revise and extend a set of learningdimensions created in a previous study of after-school ISE (informalscience education) activitiesPetrichet al., 2013). Their framework for initial environmental design factorsis included as Table 1.

The framework can be seen to incorporate elements of Resnick andRosenbaum's tool focused design framework and to extend it. The authorssee their focus on the learning dimensions of the process as a valuableextension to the scope of the research in this area beyond that of makerenvironments, tool sets and activities. The research is based on jointanalysis of video recordings of a variety of tinkering museum exhibitsby researchers and domain practitioners. A brief commentary follows onthe four categories identified in their learning dimensions framework.

*Engagement:* Beyond an observation of engagement via the duration andfrequency of undertaking activities researchers evaluated demonstrationsof emotion in the process. The authors highlight that the open endednature of tinkering allows for many moments of transition, of startingagain, refocusing, scaling up of ambition of projects, which in turnallow for evidence of persistence, improvisation and identification withthe process which give potential to map a more nuanced analysis ofengagement. *I would be interested to cross referencing this with otherexplorations definitions of engagement in this and related areas*[]{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"qeFkH8wk","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Hidi and Renninger, 2006; Kearsley and Shneiderman, 1998; Whitton and Moseley, 2014)","plainCitation":"(Hidi and Renninger, 2006; Kearsley and Shneiderman, 1998; Whitton and Moseley, 2014)"},"citationItems":[{"id":3891,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/2RB2EG5Q"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/2RB2EG5Q"],"itemData":{"id":3891,"type":"article-journal","title":"The four-phase model of interest development","container-title":"Educational psychologist","page":"111–127","volume":"41","issue":"2","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Hidi","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Renninger","given":"K.

*Initiative and Intentionality: *The research team noted that whileintentionality was present in nearly all interactions of participants,the term intentionality was best clarified further by relating it to theproblem space in focus at the time. Practitioners placed great value onpersistence and on initiative which went beyond the an open-endedapproach. Particularly when individuals self-assigninged a problem whichsignificantly increased the challenge at hand and showed a form ofintellectual courageDuckworth,2006).

*Social Scaffolding:* The revision of this category to replace that of'solidarity' from the previous framework places a greater emphasis onthe design choices of facilitators to create an environment wheresupportive interactions take place. More specifically, the authorsidentify the organisation of the space and materials in it to aid peerlearning and encouragement through physical interaction with the work ofothers.

*Dimensions of Understanding: *This category, which replaces theprevious one of 'innovation', reflecting the difficulty of measuring thenewness (and thus level of innovation) of knowledge or processes inmuseum visitors. Understanding is defined as something beyond simplefact recall. It encompasses the inclusion of tinkering activities withconcrete outcomes as well as piagetian concepts of abstract andtransferable knowledgeAckermann,2001). The framework outlines categories of visible or articulatedrealisations of concepts, peer explanations, application of learned andprior knowledge and the complexification of problems. Particularattention is placed on the idea of overcoming problems and respondingintuitively to new challenges, specifically the "improvisational"qualities of learning via tinkering.

Hackathons, Game Jams and accelerated production methods--------------------------------------------------------

Hackathon events are characterised by a time-constrained and thusaccelerated production ethos. Initially started in the domain ofprofessional and volunteer code writing, they have widened in scope toembrace other creative and educational domainsJohnsonand Robinson, 2014; Kienzler and Fontanesi, 2017).\

Game Jams are an a type of hackathon where participants create gamesindividually or in teams in a restricted period, typically 24 or 48hours. Team events often take place in physical venues which may be partof a wider global JamsAryaet al., 2013). Within Game Jams a breadth of materials are usedincluding video games, interactive fiction and even Cardboard JamsEberhardt,2016). Eberhardt also identifies potentially incompatible strands ofGame Jams. He contrasts the aims of commercialised events andprofessional Game Jammers to those of Jams with a social purpose with amore diverse, less target driven audienceEberhardt,2016, p. 3).

Goddard et al have analysed key aspects of Game Jams including tools,organisational processes and rewards systems2014),using a playful vs. gameful spectrum from Caillois2001).Design factors include; allowing teams to register before the event orenforcing a more playful team creation process, varied award categorieswhich encourage diverse outcomes rather than technically structuredawards and the culture of the Jam which may encourage risk taking andexperimental process over the creation of commercially viable products.

On the playful end of the spectrum, a collective of New York educatorshave collaborated to create a process aimed at young people that can beapplied in a shorter time-frameGamesfor Change, 2017). Their process, the Moveable Game Jam, emphasiseslow-cost and both digital and analogue offline game production. Themotivation is to communicate fundamental concepts of game design processto participants. They identify these concepts as; space, goal,components, mechanics and rules. Their educational motivation is designand systems thinking for young people aligned with the Framework for21st Century LearningGilbert,2016).

The Moveable Game Jam uses loosely structured activities and broad goalsallowing for significant learner agency. Conversely, there are elementof a more structured approaches in the steering of game outputs towardsparticular social goals, the use of periodic facilitator checking of thefundamental concepts previously mentioned and the recommendation ofextensive play testing in the process. Play testing is the process ofinvolving other participants to try out prototypes of games regularly aspart of the creation processEladhariand Ollila, 2012). It has a particular value in forcing an iterative andtime boxed approach and can be used to foster community feedback.

*With more time I would explore the details, advantages of acceleratedproduction including the alchemy of peer process, physically being theretogether and time boxing vs. the drawbacks including elements of'crunch' culture*IGDA,2014, pp. 21--22; Schreier, 2015)*. A comparison to the gamefulartificial constraints of hackathons compared to playful open endedapproaches of hacker spaces would be interesting to do*[]{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"y3nL8fKQ","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Raison, 2010)","plainCitation":"(Raison, 2010)"},"citationItems":[{"id":3913,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/5Q3DK9MD"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/5Q3DK9MD"],"itemData":{"id":3913,"type":"thesis","title":"Hackerspaces, postmodern learning spheres beyond the virtual?","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://david.raison.lu/hackerspaces_online.pdf","author":[{"family":"Raison","given":"David"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDhiAPaLgeNl}*(Raison,2010). *

Game making and Project / Problem Based Learning------------------------------------------------

Game making can be seen as an example of the kind of wicked problemfavoured in project-oriented problem based learning (referred to fromnow on as PBL)Mateasand Stern, 2005). PBL has a variety of forms, an exploration of which isbeyond the scope of this studyAditomoet al., 2013). The most pertinent areas of PBL of to this study are theover-arching focus on authentic learning environments and the process ofbuilding learner autonomy within a structured and supportive approachHernandezet al., 2015).

When learners undertake real life projects with relevance for, or with adirect link to, environments outside of the learning space, there arestrong parallels to the models of peripheral participation incommunities of practiceWenger,1998). A PBL game making process would do well to foster participationby highlighting playful paths into community participation to maximisegroup identification and sustainabilityThorstedet al., 2015). Fictional tasks and roles can also impact learnerengagementHeathcoteand Herbert, 1985).

The structuring of the learning involved in PBL is highlighted by thosewishing to defend it from dismissal as unsupported, pure discoverylearningHmelo-Silveret al., 2007; Kirschner et al., 2006). We can see parallels in PBLprogramme design to that tinkering tools and environments in thatdecisions are made to support specific areas of learner discovery deemedof particular value by carefully obscuring other potentially distractingaspects behind 'black box' processesResnickand Silverman, 2005).

Working with complex issues via Critical Making-----------------------------------------------

The final concept I want to dip into in this smörgåsbord of autonomouslearning processes is that of Critical MakingRatto,2011). In Ratto's description Critical Making he targets criticalthinking as a possible outcome of a guided process involving the socialmaking of technical objects. His aim is a widening the potential of'objects to think with' beyond science and maths to encompass civicconcerns.

The author highlights a gulf between certain schools of technical andsocial work that critical making can bridge, particularly theexploration of societal issues effected by technology. He finds use in adistinction between *caring about* an issue and a more informed *caringfor* an issue informed by experience and a sense of responsibility. Thisdistinction stems from a reframing of our reality as designed ratherthan discovered, thus shifting matters of fact (which can't be changed)into matters of concern where the outcome is at playLatour,2008).

\Ratto maps three, non-linear phases of Critical Making: exploration ofexisting areas (via texts or ideas), making prototypes to reductivelymap such ideas and finally reflection and exploration of ideas throughthe revision of prototypes. The author links the process to three keyelements of constructionism: the possibility for emotional dimension oflearning, the importance of transitional objects (projecting your selfinto objects to think with) and the value of 'messing about' to avoidconstrictive working processesPapert,1988).

In the exploration of two case studies the author recommends acknowledging and exploring the reductive nature of process of translating complex social issues into physical and digital models as a way of mitigating risks of over simplification discussions Ratto, 2011, p. 8).   **Conclusion and areas for future development **--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This writing has addressed certain pedagogical approaches and learningenvironments which may be of use in the creation of a digital gamemaking communities. There is certainly scope to find further autonomouslearning in left field areas including of hacker spaces, diy media labs,free music festivals, forum theatre and pirate communitiesWilson,2003).

\An investigation of the specific of the tools and interacting productionchains would build on the work in this study. This area would suit aconcurrent examination of the possibilities and drawbacks of the gameand game asset making software and frameworks. The low cost nature ofdeveloping in a browser using web technologies may address concernssurrounding the cost of tools and the time involved in learning digitalgame making processesWhitton,2012).

Another area of interest is the value of technological transparency in alearning context where mobile technology is ever-present but littleunderstoodEisenberget al., 2006; Resnick et al., 2000). Or put more simply, how can we bestget under the hood of the technologies that surround us to find out whatmakes them tick?
