The starting position of this study is that making computer games hasgreat potential supporting a diverse set of competencies includingcomputational practices, teamwork, problem solving and criticalthinking. Many exciting models of practice exist which have at theircore authentic links with real world issues, complex ecologies ofcooperation and accessible tool sets and practices. An open question toset context is: *What environments exist to facilitate the learning themaking of games in an authentic context in ways that maximise studentcontrol and engagement?*

This opening piece examines some overlapping concepts, environments andprocesses rather than specifics of the tools involved. Due to widefocus, the aim is more to catalogue than to contrast.

When discussing digital game making here, a wide definition is usedwhich includes: creating original games, video game level modding,sand-box games and hardware digital game hybrids (Gee and Tran, 2016).Indeed, as Buckingham and Burn point out (2007), the difference betweenmaking, playing and modding games is often blurred.

Constructionism and the legacy of LOGO--------------------------------------

Papert's interest in the educational value of the production of digitalartefacts drove the creation of the LOGO coding language some associatedphysical tools, notably drawing turtles and programmable LEGO. For thisstudy Papert's concept of a microworld is of particular interest.Microworlds are designed spaces which act as incubators for certainkinds of learning. His criteria for microworlds are that they shouldgive examples of the chosen subject learning, bring all needed conceptsinside the microworld and that there should be footholds for the enduser to put this kind of learning to use with interaction with the world(Papert, 1980, p. 126). Through the microworld Papert espouses thelearning principle that for a concept to progress beyond your existingknowledge, you must use it, play with it to find out more, finallyassimilating or accommodating your findings into your world view(Ackermann, 2001).

Ackermann's exploration of the similarities between constructionism andconstructivism identifies Papert's focus on the way learners identifyand accommodate new information thus creating new internalrepresentations of the world. *There is a lot more to be written in thisarea but I want to move on to more concrete and contemporaryenvironments.*

Of particular interest to this study are the concepts of soft and hardapproaches to coding (Papert, 1990). Whereas a hard approach infers atop down perspective, one mirrored by recent conceptions ofcomputational thinking (Wing, 2008), soft coding suggests a moreimmediate and learner directed connection with the materials or digitalartefacts involved, a connection evoking Levi Strauss' concept ofbricolage (1962).

This school of thought and Papert's co-creation of the LOGO language,has been extremely influential in the sphere of teaching STEM and mathsconcepts via computer coding. A significant output of this lineage isthe Scratch visual coding tool and community. The pedagogicalunderpinning of the Scratch project is a reframing of constructionistmethodology as software tinkering (Maloney et al., 2010; Resnick andRosenbaum, 2013).

Some of the key learning concepts valued in software tinkering are; aplayful and iterative approach, visual methods using code blocks, theability to easily revise aims and a 'bottom-up' construction processwhere small clusters of code blocks are rapidly built, tested and canthen be combined in to larger code structures. Coding concepts are saidto discovered through exploration (Maloney et al., 2010, p. 14).

Resnick et al share their design principles as a framework containing anod to architectural design (2005). Software tinkering tools should havewide walls catering for diverse interests, a low threshold to allow fornovices with little technical experience and high ceilings so learnersare not restricted by the technical limits of the creative environmentas their designs become more complex.

*I would develop this more if there were a greater word count to discusstheir framework outlined below.\Immediate Feedback: See the result, see the process\Fluid Experimentation: Easy to get started, easy to connect,\Open Exploration: Variety of materials, variety of genres*

Resnick and Rosenbaum also discuss 'tinkering with tinkerability',detailing facilitation guidelines to support the open learningprocesses. These include; setting themes not challenges, highlightingdiverse examples, tinker with space, encouraging engagement with people,posing questions instead of giving answers and combining diving in withstepping back (2013, pp. 17--19). They identify this as an area forfurther research.

Physical tinkering and making environments------------------------------------------

The keyword tinkering has also gained traction amongst practitioners andresearcher in this domain of physical making. We can contrast the moreexperimental side of the maker movement with the more instructional kitassembly approaches. Repetitive making based on preset instructions ortemptation towards 'trivial fabrication' fails to exploit potentialproblem solving and design challenges latent in the materials(Blikstein, 2013; Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013).

Bevan et al propose another perspective which values the potential ofsuch kits to build confidence and technical skills which serve to openfurther possibilities for a more playful and non-directed approach. Theysuggest a learning design strategy of alternating between fabricationand tinkering (Bevan et al., 2014).\\Let us examine in detail a study by Bevan et al on the creation of aframework to evaluate learning through tinkering in a museum setting(Bevan et al., 2015). The authors revise and extend a set of learningdimensions created in a previous study of after-school ISE (informalscience education) activities (Petrich et al., 2013). Their frameworkfor initial environmental design factors is included as Table 1.

![petrichetal.PNG](media/image1.png){width="6.5in"height="3.607638888888889in"}

The framework can be seen to incorporate elements of Resnick andRosenbaum's tool focused design framework and to extend it. The authorssee their focus on the learning dimensions of the process as a valuableextension to the scope of the research in this area beyond that of makerenvironments, tool sets and activities. The research is based on jointanalysis of video recordings of a variety of tinkering museum exhibitsby researchers and domain practitioners. A brief commentary follows onthe four categories identified in their learning dimensions framework.

*Engagement:* Beyond an observation of engagement via the duration andfrequency of undertaking activities researchers evaluated demonstrationsof emotion in the process. The authors highlight that the open endednature of tinkering allows for many moments of transition, of startingagain, refocusing, scaling up of ambition of projects, which in turnallow for evidence of persistence, improvisation and identification withthe process which give potential to map a more nuanced analysis ofengagement. *I would be interested to cross referencing this with otherexplorations definitions of engagement in this and related areas (Hidiand Renninger, 2006; Kearsley and Shneiderman, 1998; Whitton andMoseley, 2014).*

*Initiative and Intentionality:* The research team noted that whileintentionality was present in nearly all interactions of participants,the term intentionality was best clarified further by relating it to theproblem space in focus at the time. Practitioners placed great value onpersistence and on initiative which went beyond an open-ended approach.Particularly when individuals self-assigned a problem whichsignificantly increased the challenge at hand and showed a form ofintellectual courage (Duckworth, 2006).

*Social Scaffolding:* The revision of this category to replace that of'solidarity' from the previous framework places a greater emphasis onthe design choices of facilitators to create an environment wheresupportive interactions take place. More specifically, the authorsidentify the organisation of the space and materials in it to aid peerlearning and encouragement through physical interaction with the work ofothers.

*Dimensions of Understanding:* This category, which replaces theprevious one of 'innovation', reflecting the difficulty of measuring thenewness (and thus level of innovation) of knowledge or processes inmuseum visitors. Understanding is defined as something beyond simplefact recall. It encompasses the inclusion of tinkering activities withconcrete outcomes as well as Piagetian concepts of abstract andtransferable knowledge (Ackermann, 2001). The framework outlinescategories of visible or articulated realisations of concepts, peerexplanations, application of learned and prior knowledge and thecomplexification of problems. Particular attention is placed on the ideaof overcoming problems and responding intuitively to new challenges,specifically the "improvisational" qualities of learning via tinkering.

Hackathons, Game Jams and accelerated production methods--------------------------------------------------------

Hackathon events are characterised by a time-constrained and thusaccelerated production ethos. Initially started in the domain ofprofessional and volunteer code writing, they have widened in scope toembrace other creative and educational domains (Johnson and Robinson,2014; Kienzler and Fontanesi, 2017).

Game Jams are a type of hackathon where participants create gamesindividually or in teams in a restricted period, typically 24 or 48hours. Team events often take place in physical venues, which may bepart of a wider global Jams (Arya et al., 2013). Within Game Jams abreadth of materials are used including video games, interactive fictionand even Cardboard Jams (Eberhardt, 2016). Eberhardt also identifiespotentially incompatible strands of Game Jams. He contrasts the aims ofcommercialised events and professional Game Jammers to those of Jamswith a social purpose with a more diverse, less target driven audience(Eberhardt, 2016, p. 3).

Goddard et al have analysed key aspects of Game Jams including tools,organisational processes and rewards systems (2014), using a playful vs.gameful spectrum from Caillois (2001). Design factors include: allowingteams to register before the event or enforcing a more playful teamcreation process, varied award categories which encourage diverseoutcomes rather than technically structured awards and variations in theexperimental culture of the Jam. Certain Jam organisers may encouragerisk taking and new processes over the creation of commercially viableproducts.

On the playful end of the spectrum, a collective of New York educatorshave collaborated to create a process aimed at young people that can beapplied in a shorter timeframe (Games for Change, 2017). Their process,the Moveable Game Jam, emphasises low-cost and both digital and analogueoffline game production. The motivation is to communicate fundamentalconcepts of game design process to participants. They identify theseconcepts as: space, goal, components, mechanics and rules. Theireducational motivation is design and systems thinking for young peoplealigned with the Framework for 21st Century Learning (Gilbert, 2016).

The Moveable Game Jam uses loosely structured activities and broad goalsallowing for significant learner agency. Conversely, there are elementsof a more structured approaches in the steering of game outputs towardsparticular social goals. This may involve the use of periodicfacilitator checking of the fundamental concepts previously mentionedand the recommendation of extensive play testing in the process. Playtesting is the process of involving other participants to try outprototypes of games regularly as part of the creation process (Eladhariand Ollila, 2012). It has a particular value in forcing an iterative andtime boxed approach and can be used to foster community feedback.

*With more time I would explore the details, advantages of acceleratedproduction including the alchemy of peer process, physically being theretogether and time boxing vs. the drawbacks including elements of'crunch' culture* (IGDA, 2014, pp. 21--22; Schreier, 2015)*. Acomparison to the gameful artificial constraints of hackathons comparedto playful open ended approaches of hacker spaces would be interestingto do (Raison, 2010).*

Game making and Project / Problem Based Learning------------------------------------------------

Game making can be seen as an example of the kind of wicked problemfavoured in project-oriented problem based learning (referred to fromnow on as PBL) (Mateas and Stern, 2005). PBL has a variety of forms, anexploration of which is beyond the scope of this study (Aditomo et al.,2013). The most pertinent areas of PBL of to this study are theover-arching focus on authentic learning environments and the process ofbuilding learner autonomy within a structured and supportive approach(Hernandez et al., 2015).

When learners undertake real life projects with relevance for, or with adirect link to, environments outside of the learning space, there arestrong parallels to the models of peripheral participation incommunities of practice (Wenger, 1998). A PBL game making process woulddo well to foster participation by highlighting playful paths intocommunity participation to maximise group identification andsustainability (Thorsted et al., 2015). Fictional tasks and roles canalso impact learner engagement (Heathcote and Herbert, 1985).

The structuring of the learning involved in PBL is highlighted by thosewishing to defend it from dismissal as unsupported, pure discoverylearning (Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007; Kirschner et al., 2006). We can seeparallels in PBL programme design to that tinkering tools andenvironments in that decisions are made to support specific areas oflearner discovery deemed of particular value by carefully obscuringother potentially distracting aspects behind 'black box' processes(Resnick and Silverman, 2005).

Working with complex issues via Critical Making-----------------------------------------------

The final concept I want to dip into in this smörgåsbord of autonomouslearning processes is that of Critical Making (Ratto, 2011). In Ratto'sdescription Critical Making he targets critical thinking as a possibleoutcome of a guided process involving the social making of technicalobjects. His aim is a widening the potential of 'objects to think with'beyond science and maths to encompass civic concerns.

The author highlights a gulf between certain schools of technical andsocial work that critical making can bridge, particularly theexploration of societal issues effected by technology. He finds use in adistinction between *caring about* an issue and a more informed *caringfor* an issue informed by experience and a sense of responsibility. Thisdistinction stems from a reframing of our reality as designed ratherthan discovered, thus shifting matters of fact (which can't be changed)into matters of concern where the outcome is at play (Latour, 2008).

Ratto maps three, non-linear phases of Critical Making: exploration ofexisting areas (via texts or ideas), making prototypes to reductivelymap such ideas and finally reflection and exploration of ideas throughthe revision of prototypes. The author links the process to three keyelements of constructionism: the possibility for emotional dimension oflearning, the importance of transitional objects (projecting your selfinto objects to think with) and the value of 'messing about' to avoidconstrictive working processes (Papert, 1988).

In the exploration of two case studies the author recommends acknowledging and exploring the reductive nature of process of translating complex social issues into physical and digital models as a way of mitigating risks of over simplification discussions (Ratto, 2011, p. 8).  **Conclusion and areas for future development** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This writing has addressed certain pedagogical approaches and learningenvironments which may be of use in the creation of a digital gamemaking communities. There is certainly scope to find further autonomouslearning in left field areas including of hacker spaces, diy media labs,free music festivals, forum theatre and pirate communities (Wilson,2003).

An investigation of the specific of the tools and interacting productionchains would build on the work in this study. This area would suit aconcurrent examination of the possibilities and drawbacks of the gameand game asset making software and frameworks. The low cost nature ofdeveloping in a browser using web technologies may address concernssurrounding the cost of tools and the time involved in learning digitalgame making processes (Whitton, 2012).

Another area of interest is the value of technological transparency in alearning context where mobile technology is ever-present but littleunderstood (Eisenberg et al., 2006; Resnick et al., 2000). Or put moresimply, how can we best get under the hood of the technologies thatsurround us to find out what makes them tick?
