### The Research Project

Is the working title of the project appropriate for the research proposal?

![](media/image2.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes ![](media/image3.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

**Comments**

I\'m not sure. The use of the term \'intergenerational\' in the title made me expect the groups involved to be broader. Parents and children is a a very particular type of intergenerational relationship, so I wondered whetehr you needed to be more specific about this?

Is the proposal approximately 1000 ( 10%) words and a font size 12?

![](media/image13.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes ![](media/image17.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

**Comments**

**Are the academic aims of the research project:**

a\) Clearly stated?

![](media/image36.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes ![](media/image37.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

b\) Developed in a coherent manner?

![](media/image20.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes ![](media/image39.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

![](media/image30.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes ![](media/image15.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

**Comments**

The research questions are clear and coherent - and I can clearly see how they link to the methods.

I\'ve put no for question d) because I didn\'t really understand what you meant by a \'playful pedagogical framework\'. Why (or how) is what you are proposing to do \'playful\'? Material and community activities might be playful, but how do you know the framework you produce will be playful at this point?

### Research Design and Methods

Is the theoretical analysis of methods appropriate to the field of study?

![](media/image7.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes ![](media/image22.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

**Comments**

The methods and data analysis are well explained.

### Contribution to knowledge

**For MPhil/PhD or PhD only:** Will the proposed research make a significant contribution to knowledge?

![](media/image34.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes ![](media/image5.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

**Comments**

You explain how your research relates to prior research and attempts to respond to identified gaps in knowledge.

### Ethics

I have undertaken an independent scrutiny of the Ethics Checklist and reviewed the Ethics Checklist Form (for RNCM students, this will be the Ethical Clearance Form)

![](media/image32.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes ![](media/image1.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

Are there any ethical issues raised within the research?

![](media/image33.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes ![](media/image6.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

**Comments**

There are of course ethical issues (working with under 16s etc), but I am sure these will be addressed through the ethics approval process.

### Risk Assessment

Has a risk assessment been undertaken for the project?

![](media/image29.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} Yes ![](media/image28.png){width="0.6944444444444444in" height="0.6944444444444444in"} No

Written Report for the Student and Supervisory Team ---------------------------------------------------

**The scrutineer is asked to provide context for the recommendation proposed above and to provide guidance or advice that will be beneficial to the student and supervisory team**

This is a clearly written, well-structured proposal that sets out the background to the research, research questions and methods to be used coherently. By focusing on social approaches rather than tools and processes, the proposed research has potential to make an important contribution to knowledge, and also possibly to the practices of educators working on these types of settings.

I have two fairly minor queries:

1\. The use of the term intergenerational in the title: to me, this suggested working with a broader group than just parents and children. I\'m not saying you have to change this: you might decide you want to keep this in the title, but then explain that you are focusing on a particular type of intergenerational relationship?

2\. The \'playful pedagogical framework\': I appreciate you have limited words, but I was struggling to understand how the framework you create will be playful. It may be, but how do you know this at the moment - and what makes it playful if so?

Overall though, it sounds like a really interesting piece and research and I\'m looking forward to hearing about how it develops.
