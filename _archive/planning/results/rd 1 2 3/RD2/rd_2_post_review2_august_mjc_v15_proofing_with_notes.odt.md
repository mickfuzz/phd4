Aims of Study  --------------

This study is concerned with the potential benefits of code-based digital game making via project work. The perceived need to teach young people to code and develop digital fluency is fuelled by disparate motivations, including providing talent for STEM and digital creative industries [@the_royal_society_after_2017], shaping informed and active digital citizens []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"TZ0jcEtG","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Williamson, 2016)","plainCitation":"(Williamson, 2016)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":7352,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/GG66IA53"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/GG66IA53"],"itemData":{"id":7352,"type":"article-journal","title":"Political computational thinking: policy networks, digital governance and ‘learning to code’","container-title":"Critical Policy Studies","page":"39-58","volume":"10","issue":"1","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","abstract":"Reflecting political shifts toward both ‘network governance’ and ‘digital governance’, the idea of ‘learning to code’ has become part of a major reform agenda in education policy in England.

In today’s world digital technology is a given for most young people. But if they are to contribute to a rapidly changing and complex global society, they need to understand how digital technologies work. Young people need the skills of content creation, collaboration and communication so they can use digital technologies to solve problems and express themselves. Digital making is the creative process of making a product or digital artefact - from websites, apps, games, and 3D animations to physical objects driven by microcontrollers. Digital making will often mean using coding and programming skills as well as the creative use of digital tools to make new products. Digital making skills are fundamentally underpinned by an understanding of computational thinking but may also include things like creative teamwork, problem solving, engineering and design in order to build new technologies. However, the role of digital technology for learning and the place of making all come with different (often competing) traditions and educational practices. As such, understanding how we best support young people as digital makers is a complex challenge and one which requires careful consideration – something this report sets out to do. As we continue to work with partners such as Nesta and Mozilla to support a generation of digital makers, I look forward to your comments and hope we can work together to address the issues set out in this document. - See more at: http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/knowledge-centre/articles/mapping-digital-makers#sthash.RUEzvur5.dpuf","URL":"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/","shortTitle":"Mapping digital makers","author":[{"family":"Sefton-Green","given":"Julian"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,18]]}},"label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDqqUvv8HG5U}(Mozilla Foundation, 2012; Sefton-Green, 2013).

As making activities spread from Maker Faires—large events that showcase DIY creations—and fabrication spaces in children’s museums, science centers, and community organizations to school classrooms, they provide new opportunities for learning while challenging many current conventions of schooling. In this paper, we consider one disruptive area of making: electronic textiles. We examine high school students’ experiences making electronic textile designs across three workshops taking place over the course of a school year. To analyze students’ engagement and learning we focused on the following research questions: How does designing with e-textile materials promote transparency of technology? What role do aesthetic considerations play in students’ making of e-textiles? In what ways do e-textile activities complicate students’ gendered perspectives on computing and engineering? Our study is based on an examination of students’ design processes and final e-textile products, observations of workshop activities and conversations, and debriefing interviews conducted with students at the end of each workshop. Throughout this paper, we discuss individual students’ experiences making e-textiles in the context of broader findings regarding themes of transparency, aesthetics, and gender that come into play when making with e-textiles. In our discussion, we examine the role of e-textiles as both an opportunity and challenge facing the Maker movement as it advances into schools as well as more general needs in breaking down traditional barriers to computing.","DOI":"10.17763/haer.84.4.46m7372370214783","ISSN":"0017-8055, 1943-5045","shortTitle":"Electronic Textiles as Disruptive Designs","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Kafai","given":"Yasmin"},{"family":"Fields","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Searle","given":"Kristin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12]]}},"label":"page"},{"id":6512,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/BR375U65"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/BR375U65"],"itemData":{"id":6512,"type":"book","title":"Makeology: Makerspaces as Learning Environments","publisher":"Routledge","number-of-pages":"303","source":"Google Books","abstract":"Makeology introduces the emerging landscape of the Maker Movement and its connection to interest-driven learning.

In this dissertation, I explore the possibilities of engaging kids and their families as computational creators - providing opportunities and support to enable them to create things they care about with computing, to see themselves as creators, and to imagine the ways they can shape their world. I especially focus on families with limited access to resources and social support around computing. I describe the design of a community-based outreach program called Family Creative Learning, which invites kids, their families, and other families in their community to create and learn together using creative technologies. I use a qualitative approach to document the complex and diverse learning experiences of families. Through studies of family participation, I examine how kids and their parents supported one another and how the Family Creative Learning environment, activities, tools, and facilitation supported families in their development as computational creators.

My research will investigate the inclusion of a broad range of communicative and creative competencies via a creative computing activity and the impact of their development in a family learing context.

The ongoing game making programme that forms the basis for this study has already been run in several iterations of between four to eight weeks of weekly two hour sessions. As part of my role in the EdLab programme of the MMU Faculty of Education I run outreach activities and focus groups which target local home education communities; here game making as an educational activity was highlighted by both parents and children as an area of high interest. Children and parents from home educating families attend sessions in the MMU Brooks building in a classroom with access to laptop computers. Young participants from ages eight to twelve attend with one or two family members who are normally parents or grandparents. Normal course attendance comprises six to ten young people; participants are all invited to make games using online software tools and the end products are text-coded computer games which are playable in web pages.

My study takes a social historical approach to support analysis and development of a playful game making programme in a non-formal environment. I will explore family participation in collaborative digital game making to develop twenty-first century skills. I do this by facilitating the creation of a community of learners undertaking a programme making digital games. I expose, analyse and attempt to resolve tensions in my evolving game making programme and investigate how the goals and culture of participants interact with the tools and potential outcomes of the programme.

For the duration of this study, it was noticeable that the group of students easily adapted to Scratch. We concluded that the use of this tool motivates students and improves the learning process. It also contributes to a higher level of concentration and promotes collaborative learning. Additionally, it facilitates creativity, dialogue and the overall relationship among students.

We found that the majority of studies focused on teaching coding and academic content through game making, and that few studies explicitly examined the roles of collaboration and identity in the game making process. We argue that future discussions of serious gaming ought to be more inclusive of constructionist approaches to realize the full potential of serious gaming. Making games, we contend, not only more genuinely introduces children to a range of technical skills but also better connects them to each other, addressing the persistent issues of access and diversity present in traditional digital gaming cultures.","DOI":"10.1080/00461520.2015.1124022","ISSN":"0046-1520","note":"PMID: 27019536\nPMCID: PMC4784508","shortTitle":"Constructionist Gaming","journalAbbreviation":"Educ Psychol","author":[{"family":"Kafai","given":"Yasmin B."},{"family":"Burke","given":"Quinn"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]}},"label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDnd5S0oXwav}(Earp, 2015; Kafai and Burke, 2015) and game modification []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"PVmYPwaT","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Gee and Tran, 2016; Kynigos and Yiannoutsou, 2018)","plainCitation":"(Gee and Tran, 2016; Kynigos and Yiannoutsou, 2018)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":3051,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/CENDC7Q4"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/CENDC7Q4"],"itemData":{"id":3051,"type":"chapter","title":"Video Game Making & Modding","container-title":"Handbook of Research on the Societal Impact of Digital Media:","collection-title":"Advances in Media, Entertainment, and the Arts","publisher":"IGI Global","publisher-place":"Hershey PA","source":"Google Scholar","event-place":"Hershey PA","URL":"http://betsydisalvo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gee_GLS11-Proceedings-2015.pdf","shortTitle":"Video Game Making & Modding in the Wild","author":[{"family":"Gee","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Kelly"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,18]]}},"label":"page"},{"id":5835,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/KLB4BDFL"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/KLB4BDFL"],"itemData":{"id":5835,"type":"article-journal","title":"Children challenging the design of half-baked games: Expressing values through the process of game modding","container-title":"International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"In this paper we look at the potential educational value of placing children in a dual role of identifying and changing rules and values embedded in digital games by hacking them. Children’s participation in the design of learning technologies is a difficult challenge to address, due to limitations in children’s domain-knowledge around which these technologies are developed. Their role in the design process is thus usually limited to that of a user or tester. In this paper we discuss the role of children as “hackers” of what we call ‘half-baked’ games. By hacking a pedagogically engineered half-baked game in order to improve or change it, children are expected to challenge the values, the mechanics and the rules of a fully functioning, but faulty, or inappropriate game originally designed to provoke students to modify it. This discussion uses an example of children modding such a game provocatively called ‘PerfectVille’, which was specially designed to raise problems around the issue of urban sustainability. The game itself was designed with the use of a GIS rule-based authoring tool for game design called ‘sus-x’. The children grappled with both value-laden issues and concepts embedded in the tool they used. The issue of taking children’s values into account but also of helping them to build understandings of wider contested societal values can be addressed by studying the process by which children design and change games affording such experiences. It also illuminated their own perspective and values, which they embedded in the games.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212868916300861","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijcci.2018.04.001","ISSN":"2212-8689","shortTitle":"Children challenging the design of half-baked games","journalAbbreviation":"International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction","author":[{"family":"Kynigos","given":"Chronis"},{"family":"Yiannoutsou","given":"Nikoleta"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,21]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,18]]}},"label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDwTEiV4LuVp}(Gee and Tran, 2016; Kynigos and Yiannoutsou, 2018) show that these interrelated skills are under-represented in the research in this domain.

To allow the development of the social and systems-related elements of twenty-first century skills, the game making programme has been designed to facilitate participant collaboration and learner choice of activities.

Social support can play a major role in engaging and deepening what young people can learn and do with technology.

In this dissertation, I explore the possibilities of engaging kids and their families as computational creators - providing opportunities and support to enable them to create things they care about with computing, to see themselves as creators, and to imagine the ways they can shape their world. I especially focus on families with limited access to resources and social support around computing. I describe the design of a community-based outreach program called Family Creative Learning, which invites kids, their families, and other families in their community to create and learn together using creative technologies. I use a qualitative approach to document the complex and diverse learning experiences of families. Through studies of family participation, I examine how kids and their parents supported one another and how the Family Creative Learning environment, activities, tools, and facilitation supported families in their development as computational creators.

It details both its method of enquiry and theoretical foundations and shares the emerging findings. The purpose of the research was to understand the nature of the support that process drama offers to children as writers and to identify any features of writing which regularly surfaced in children’s drama related writing. The research team, comprising two lecturers and three primary school teachers adopted a qualitative approach and a range of research methods, including: video stimulated recall, observation of the case study children’s involvement, analysis of their writing and focus group interviews. Process drama sessions based on picture fiction were planned and two approaches trialled in the pilot study to connect drama and writing. The first, termed ‘genre specific’ involved working towards a chosen text form at a designated moment during process drama, the second involved more spontaneously ‘seizing the moment’ to write. The main study focused on the latter approach and examined the elements of drama that impacted upon and supported children’s writing. The connecting threads identified included: the presence of tension, emotional engagement and incubation, and a strong sense of perspective and purpose gained in part through role adoption. When these threads were in evidence, the writing produced captured and held the interest and attention of the reader and showed a clear sense of authorial stance. In addition, it was frequently full of inventive details and the choice of language used tended to be powerful and emotive, often demonstrating a marked degree of empathy. The team observed that in addition to a palpable increase in motivation and commitment, an enhanced sense of focus, flow and ease in writing was noticeable when the children wrote in-role during process drama. Furthermore, the children often chose to revisit writing begun in the context of drama, to reshape and develop it further. The paper demonstrates that drama has much to contribute to the composing life of the primary classroom and discusses the pedagogical implications of this research.","DOI":"10.1080/13569780600900636","ISSN":"1356-9783, 1470-112X","shortTitle":"Connecting drama and writing","journalAbbreviation":"Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Cremin","given":"Teresa"},{"family":"Goouch","given":"Kathy"},{"family":"Blakemore","given":"Louise"},{"family":"Goff","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Macdonald","given":"Roger"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",11]]}},"label":"page"},{"id":7594,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/IFNNS9FB"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/IFNNS9FB"],"itemData":{"id":7594,"type":"article-journal","title":"‘Playing the Game called Writing’: Children’s Views and Voices","container-title":"English in Education","page":"4-15","volume":"37","issue":"2","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","abstract":"Teachers’ perceptions of their changing practice in the context of the National Literacy Strategy have been well documented in recent years.

This contribution charts the emergence and establishment of learner-driven digital game making through a systematic review of the global literature on the topic published since the early 1980s. It maps out the research concerns under investigation in the field, as gleaned from a dataset of almost 500 publications of different types specifically dedicated to the topic. The review forms part of the author's research activities in game making for learning carried out with an EC co-funded project called MAGICAL (Making Games in Collaboration for Learning). The review begins with a description of the method and procedure adopted for carrying out the literature search and producing a comprehensive dataset of records. This is followed by reporting and analysis of the generated data. The review concludes with a brief discussion and reflection on the results.","shortTitle":"Game Making for Learning","author":[{"family":"Earp","given":"Jeffrey"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,17]]}},"label":"page"},{"id":3051,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/CENDC7Q4"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/CENDC7Q4"],"itemData":{"id":3051,"type":"chapter","title":"Video Game Making & Modding","container-title":"Handbook of Research on the Societal Impact of Digital Media:","collection-title":"Advances in Media, Entertainment, and the Arts","publisher":"IGI Global","publisher-place":"Hershey PA","source":"Google Scholar","event-place":"Hershey PA","URL":"http://betsydisalvo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gee_GLS11-Proceedings-2015.pdf","shortTitle":"Video Game Making & Modding in the Wild","author":[{"family":"Gee","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Tran","given":"Kelly"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,18]]}},"label":"page"},{"id":4917,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/TN54K9Y3"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/TN54K9Y3"],"itemData":{"id":4917,"type":"article-journal","title":"Making Computer Games and Design Thinking: A Review of Current Software and Strategies","container-title":"Games and Culture","page":"309-332","volume":"3","issue":"3-4","source":"Crossref","DOI":"10.1177/1555412008317312","ISSN":"1555-4120, 1555-4139","shortTitle":"Making Computer Games and Design Thinking","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hayes","given":"Elisabeth R."},{"family":"Games","given":"Ivan Alex"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",7]]}},"label":"page"},{"id":3644,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/Q7JCMQ3N"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/Q7JCMQ3N"],"itemData":{"id":3644,"type":"article-journal","title":"Constructionist Gaming: Understanding the Benefits of Making Games for Learning","container-title":"Educational Psychologist","page":"313-334","volume":"50","issue":"4","source":"PubMed Central","abstract":"There has been considerable interest in examining the educational potential of playing video games.

But if they are to contribute to a rapidly changing and complex global society, they need to understand how digital technologies work. Young people need the skills of content creation, collaboration and communication so they can use digital technologies to solve problems and express themselves. Digital making is the creative process of making a product or digital artefact - from websites, apps, games, and 3D animations to physical objects driven by microcontrollers. Digital making will often mean using coding and programming skills as well as the creative use of digital tools to make new products. Digital making skills are fundamentally underpinned by an understanding of computational thinking but may also include things like creative teamwork, problem solving, engineering and design in order to build new technologies. However, the role of digital technology for learning and the place of making all come with different (often competing) traditions and educational practices. As such, understanding how we best support young people as digital makers is a complex challenge and one which requires careful consideration – something this report sets out to do.

Joint analysis of video recordings by researchers and domain practitioners resulted in created complementary frameworks which address both the factors considered in the design of interventions and the resulting learning that occurs. The resulting learning dimensions framework identifies four learning categories: engagement, initiative and intentionality, social scaffolding and dimensions of understanding. The authors position this work as a response to those sceptical as to the educational value of such open-ended activities where there is no formal testing and expressions of knowledge understandings and creative processes are fleeting. In the next section I outline a methodology which draws on this systematic use of video recordings to potentially create similar outputs.

Methodology and Methods -----------------------

This section will outline the methodology and methods of my study and explain why they are consistent with my research questions, which are;

-   What methods currently exist to facilitate collaborative learning in     non-formal digital making environments? -   What factors should be considered when designing for learner choice     and collaboration in digital game making environments? -   What effect does family involvement have on the potential for     collaborative pedagogical approaches to digital game making? -   What effect does a pedagogical model focused on learner choice have     on parent and child learner experiences of digital game making ?

The first question will be addressed by the literature review of my thesis. In my emerging literature review here I have outlined the gaps in current research which will be explored by the subsequent questions. The focus of this study is on the construction of shared meaning and practices as part of an emerging community of game makers.

Despite the appeal of the notion that learners construct their understanding, I argue that constructivism is problematic because it ignores the subjectivity of the learner and the socially and historically situated nature of knowing; it denies the essentially collaborative and social nature of meaning making; and it privileges only one form of knowledge, namely, the technical rational. I then present a critique of active learning and student-centered forms of pedagogy. I argue that in our models of teaching we rely on too many unexamined assumptions from developmental psychology and we take for granted the problematic notion that children learn by doing. My central thesis is that constructivism is flawed because of its inability to come to grips with the essential issues of culture, power, and discourse in the classroom. In the concluding section of the article I present a preliminary account of a sociocultural approach to teaching and learning that takes seriously the notion that learning is situated in contexts, that students bring their own subjectivities and cultural perspectives to bear in constructing understanding, that issues of power exist in the classroom that need to be addressed, and that education into scientific ways of knowing requires understanding modes of classroom discourse and enabling students to negotiate these modes effectively so that they may master and critique scientific ways of knowing without, in the process, sacrificing their own personally and culturally constructed ways of knowing.","DOI":"10.1002/tea.3660290805","ISSN":"1098-2736","shortTitle":"Rethinking science education","language":"en","author":[{"family":"O'loughlin","given":"Michael"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]}},"label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDMN3aA4EcBJ}(O'loughlin, 1992).

Five central principles of activity theory are presented, namely activity system as unit of analysis, multi-voicedness of activity, historicity of activity, contradictions as driving force of change in activity, and expansive cycles as possible form of transformation in activity. Together the four questions and ve principles form a matrix which is used to present a study of expansive learning in a hospital setting in Finland. In conclusion, implications of the framework for our understanding of the increasingly important horizontal dimension of learning are discussed.","DOI":"10.1080/13639080020028747","ISSN":"1363-9080, 1469-9435","shortTitle":"Expansive Learning at Work","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Engeström","given":"Yrjö"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",2]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDrfSkG4dR5U}(Engeström, 2001).

Three projects, including two Change Laboratories (CL), are analyzed with the help of conceptual lenses derived from basic epistemological principles for intervention research in activity theory. In all three interventions, learners expansively transformed the object of their activity. The CL cases, however, show that this learning process included productive deviations from the researchers’ instructional intentions, leading to significant outcomes, both practical and theoretical, that were not anticipated by the interventionists. Together, these cases illustrate that an activity-theoretical formative intervention approach differs from design based research in the following ways: 1) formative interventions are based on design done by the learners; 2) the collective design effort is seen as part of an expansive learning process, including participatory analyses and implementation phases; 3) rather than aiming at transferable and scalable solutions, formative interventions aim at generative solutions developing over lengthy periods of time in both the researched activities and in the research community.","DOI":"10.1080/10508406.2016.1204547","ISSN":"1050-8406, 1532-7809","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of the Learning Sciences","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Sannino","given":"Annalisa"},{"family":"Engeström","given":"Yrjö"},{"family":"Lemos","given":"Monica"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10]]}},"label":"page"}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDIlhIDRwCip}(Engeström, 2011; Sannino et al., 2016). While both note the value of iteration in experimental design, an expansive approach takes in to account a mutual influence on the evolution of the experimental design from both researchers and participants. As I will explore in the following section, my study has proved to be suitable to an iterative approach with input from participants into the evolving learning design and resources used. While there is a relatively limited scope for large shifts of culture due to the relatively short exposure times and length of participant involvement, there is a relatively high degree of authenticity of tasks. This is relevant as this study my be able to draw on methods which are more commonly applied to workplace research.

The emergent nature of the process of project implementation in expansive learning is mirrored in the evolving nature of the AT itself. The status of AT as a static, consistent set of methods is contested not only by critics who highlight fragmented applications or different variants of AT []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"zQ0XxhCd","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Bakhurst, 2009)","plainCitation":"(Bakhurst, 2009)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":7281,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/KS39YFI2"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/KS39YFI2"],"itemData":{"id":7281,"type":"article-journal","title":"Reflections on activity theory","container-title":"Educational Review","page":"197-210","volume":"61","issue":"2","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","abstract":"It is sometimes suggested that activity theory represents the most important legacy of Soviet philosophy and psychology.

This paper argues that the resulting position is in fact in tension with the concerns of the Russian founders of the tradition.

Data Gathering and Analysis

My study draws on traditional ethnographic methods of my journal as participant observer, participant interviews and analysis of artefacts used and created. I also record the workshop area with a 360 degree video camera and capture of screen data and audio of the laptops used by participants. One of the challenges of adopting a naturalistic research approach is to work with material gathered to find and describe patterns of behaviour.

I am guided by approaches which use video to develop both in-depth thematic analysis and broader narratives such as case studies []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"UMWzf7ug","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Derry et al., 2010)","plainCitation":"(Derry et al., 2010)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":7403,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/UNBJDRSL"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/UNBJDRSL"],"itemData":{"id":7403,"type":"article-journal","title":"Conducting Video Research in the Learning Sciences: Guidance on Selection, Analysis, Technology, and Ethics","container-title":"Journal of the Learning Sciences","page":"3-53","volume":"19","issue":"1","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","DOI":"10.1080/10508400903452884","ISSN":"1050-8406, 1532-7809","shortTitle":"Conducting Video Research in the Learning Sciences","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of the Learning Sciences","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Derry","given":"Sharon J."},{"family":"Pea","given":"Roy D."},{"family":"Barron","given":"Brigid"},{"family":"Engle","given":"Randi A."},{"family":"Erickson","given":"Frederick"},{"family":"Goldman","given":"Ricki"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Rogers"},{"family":"Koschmann","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Lemke","given":"Jay L."},{"family":"Sherin","given":"Miriam Gamoran"},{"family":"Sherin","given":"Bruce L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1,27]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDog54eG27iw}(Derry et al., 2010).

Thus Wells proposes that analysis of dialogue should take place in combination with other action not involving talk and in relation to wider activity goals.

My journal entries contain notes and initial analysis of workshop sessions and resulting reflections on experimental design and facilitation. Post-workshop participant interviews will gather information to support analysis of specifics of in-session interactions and relevant detail of wider activity systems of home digital use and other relevant interests. Digital artefacts created as part of the game making process include text-based games, pixel art, digital audio sound effects and background music. AT allows an exploration these diverse sources of information as mediating artefacts which are the enabler and product of the shifting goals and outcomes of the programmes participants.

While the rich set of data invites the cross referencing of the many sources, it also presents challenge on how to deal effectively with the large amounts of data being gathered. The use of a 360 camera reduces the amount of live video footage of interactions needed. Instead of multiple cameras pointed in different directions to capture participant interaction, participants are arranged in a square pointing inwards towards a central 360 degree camera. When triangulating data from various sources, I will prioritise critical moments in depth which illuminate key themes.

Work Already Undertaken -----------------------

I have carried out three stages of pilot workshops with home educator families. I will outline activities that have taken place at each stage of activity and include some early results.

The first phase of delivery in late 2018 was based on initial research stage; I drew on literature to identify factors to consider when designing for collaboration. I adopted an open project based approach which integrated drama games to aid group bonding and reflection. I chose a tool set which drew on relevant design principles explored earlier []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"5xjcMzwS","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013)","plainCitation":"(Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":613,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/BDRIVMQZ"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/BDRIVMQZ"],"itemData":{"id":613,"type":"article-journal","title":"Designing for tinkerability","container-title":"Design, make, play: Growing the next generation of STEM innovators","page":"163–181","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Resnick","given":"Mitchel"},{"family":"Rosenbaum","given":"Eric"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDGaHetHFlHq}(Resnick and Rosenbaum, 2013). The tools allow participants to create games using a combination of a free to use online tools. They comprise a coding environment using the phaser javascript game library (glitch.com), a pixel art editor (piskelapp.com), and a sound effect generator (sfbgames.com/chiptone). One of the principles that I prioritised in the choice of tools was that of immediate feedback for participants. For example, in the code editing interface of glitch.com shown in Illustration 1, changes made to the code on the left section take immediate effect in the resultant game on the right side of the screen.

![\ Illustration 1: Screenshot of the code editing interface and resulting game output at glitch.com](Pictures/1000000000000416000001B2CE2480DE209EEC24.png){width="17cm" height="7.054cm"}

In terms of supporting resources, stage one was exploratory and responsive; I had no pre-existing supporting materials and created a starting code framework of a platform game and code examples to add extra functionality to the game as the programme developed. At the end of this stage participants showed their games to students in the foyer of the MMU Brooks building and gave me feedback on their participation in the programme.

The second phase in early 2019 drew on this participant feedback and detailed reading of relevant literature to bring substantial changes to the programme. While still driven by participant interests, it took a more structured approach. The resources included small scale starting challenges as A5 hand-outs, step-by-step tutorials as book chapters, and code examples as online projects illustrating key additions to the game. I have brought the workshops resources together a book published on the FLOSS Manuals documentation platform []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"t5mj2dbw","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Chesterman, 2019)","plainCitation":"(Chesterman, 2019)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":7418,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/BBIX88JR"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/BBIX88JR"],"itemData":{"id":7418,"type":"report","title":"Phaser Game Making in Glitch","abstract":"Free Manuals for Free Software","URL":"https://en.flossmanuals.net/phaser-game-making-in-glitch/_full/","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Chesterman","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,19]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDklilByZG8q}(Chesterman, 2019) and an online project-hub linking to all resources []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"TIJlo8RJ","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Chesterman and Potts, 2019)","plainCitation":"(Chesterman and Potts, 2019)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":7672,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/ZDT7FKFZ"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/ZDT7FKFZ"],"itemData":{"id":7672,"type":"report","title":"Phaser Game Making In Glitch - Resource Hub","URL":"https://glitch-game-makers-manual.glitch.me/","author":[{"family":"Chesterman","given":""},{"family":"Potts","given":"Dave"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,22]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDd7F2D7YWOS}(Chesterman and Potts, 2019). I also carried out four video-recorded interviews with practioners who work with creative methods and technology with young people or families. Early analysis of these interviews has helped shape the evolving design of my programme and has brought into focus key areas of interest already identified in journal entries.

In the third iteration in May 2019 I drew on previous work with the MMU Faculty of Education drama department []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"FzkVG4ai","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Patterson et al., 2019)","plainCitation":"(Patterson et al., 2019)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":7592,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/5P66QFBW"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/5P66QFBW"],"itemData":{"id":7592,"type":"chapter","title":"Drama and STEM","container-title":"STEM in the Primary Curriculum","publisher":"Learning Matters","publisher-place":"Thousand Oaks, CA","edition":"1 edition","source":"Amazon","event-place":"Thousand Oaks, CA","abstract":"How can teachers harness the power of STEM education and learning in the primary curriculum?

I also began the data gathering process. I recorded all interactions via use of 360 camera and screen capture of workstations and undertook post-course interviews with participants. Work on analysis of this data is contained in early results section below.

At times these may be shared between participants, at times in conflict. Example interviews with participants showed overlaps and divergence between young people's motivations (to have fun, work with others together, 'learn how to make hard games,' create art), those of parents (create opportunities to learn coding and gain digital skills, 'understand my child's world of games', build collaboration and teamwork skills) and those of the facilitators (create opportunities for collaborative problem solving and media creation between participants, build meta-cognition of participants and roles as peer supporters). I have already started analysis of journal entries and parent and child discourse and wider interactions from the screen capture data. The following areas of interest are emerging.

Early contradictions between my goals and those of families

Initial feedback from participants on stage one showed tensions between my initial desire for a minimally-guided project approach in team groups consisting of three families -- which I believed would maximise personally meaningful goal setting and collaborative work -- and the experience of participants. While participants enjoyed the playful, and flexible approach to learning, they requested more structure and supporting resources. While many appreciated the social nature of the course they found working as a large group problematic at times. Specifically they identified a tendency for the younger participants to focus on making pixel art game elements while parents felt a responsibility to drive coding work. Some parents found coordinating group work stressful particularly in the light of their unfamiliarity with the coding tools and processes. One parent with experience of arts studio practice pointed to a need to have more hands-on time working with the tools before engaging with creative group work.

Subsequently, when more resources were in place, I observed the leveraging of programme tools and resources by parents. I was struck how the printed and online resources designed to support the technical process of game making were used at times by parents to refocus young people on tasks. One iteration of the programme used a narrative device of designing a game for an alien audience. Informal workshop evaluation and interview data shows that this device was embraced not only by young people who enjoyed a surreal and playful elements, but also by parents who used the urgency and direction of the fiction to redirect the attention of young people towards goals which they values such as trying to integrate new coding elements or to work more collaboratively. The intervention seemed successful to resolve some of the tensions present due to their divergent goals.

Tensions and resolutions related to programme goals and family culture

As previously mentioned, there are often significant cultural barriers to computer coding []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"FOwITshn","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Wong, 2016)","plainCitation":"(Wong, 2016)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":7455,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/DIVMGAXL"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/DIVMGAXL"],"itemData":{"id":7455,"type":"article-journal","title":"‘I’m good, but not that good’: digitally-skilled young people’s identity in computing","container-title":"Computer Science Education","page":"299-317","volume":"26","issue":"4","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","abstract":"Computers and information technology are fast becoming a part of young people’s everyday life. However, there remains a difference between the majority who can use computers and the minority who are computer scientists or professionals. Drawing on 32 semi-structured interviews with digitally skilled young people (aged 13–19), we explore their views and aspirations in computing, with a focus on the identities and discourses that these youngsters articulate in relation to this field. Our findings suggest that, even among digitally skilled young people, traditional identities of computing as people who are clever but antisocial still prevail, which can be unattractive for youths, especially girls. Digitally skilled youths identify with computing in different ways and for different reasons. Most enjoy doing computing but few aspired to being a computer person. Implications of our findings for computing education are discussed especially the continued need to broaden identities in computing, even for the digitally skilled.","DOI":"10.1080/08993408.2017.1292604","ISSN":"0899-3408","shortTitle":"‘I’m good, but not that good’","author":[{"family":"Wong","given":"Billy"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12,8]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDDTCWPcvqiu}(Wong, 2016). While early results indicate that for some young people parental involvement in shaping a positive attitude to the programme and persist in undertaking challenging activities, the accompanying challenge of overcoming parental fear of text coding is also apparent. There is also a complexity in conflicting reactions of young people which at times seek to exclude parents from involvement in their game making favouring peer interaction at times and whilst returning for parental approval at others. Media literacy and digital fluency, much more than computational thinking and competency while not a core part of my goals but it emerged as a significant outcomes of pilot studies. Interestingly the remembering of passwords, specific administration processes for webtool use and other aspects of fluency were often delegated to other family members. I am interested in this emerging social dimension of the operationalising -- in the sense of making routine -- of such processes []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"uFQizRNr","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Leont\\uc0\\u8217{}ev, 1974)","plainCitation":"(Leont’ev, 1974)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":7276,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/7U5YYURT"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/7U5YYURT"],"itemData":{"id":7276,"type":"article-journal","title":"The Problem of Activity in Psychology","container-title":"Soviet Psychology","page":"4-33","volume":"13","issue":"2","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","abstract":"In recent years Soviet psychology has undergone rapid development in its various branches of applied research, while theoretical problems of general psychology have received much less attention.

Tensions related to community norms, tools and participant goals

A significant conflict exists between programme tools which promote a social approach to learning, and the individual desire for control over the game making environment. A revision of programme design which allowed participants to self select working grouping led to greater individual and parental pair working. Participants were motivated by their full control over the incorporation of graphical and audio elements and ability to make changes in code and see the effects immediately. This has prompted further adaptations in the learning design which allow for this retention of control, which encourage learners to experiment with multiple pathways but which also promote shared creation of meaning in collaborative activities. Additionally, I identified a tension that excessive fragmentation of the activities undertaken -- driven by the motivating factor of learner choice -- could decrease the ability of participants to learn from each other. My journal entries document my thinking of the role of resources which evolved from a step-by-step guide to a dual approach which encouraged diverse learner pathways stemming from a shared framework and a complementary instruction-based resources. Some parent-child pairs worked through the structured foundation on coding structures and concepts at home and found this supported their more exploratory work in sessions well.

**Observations on frustrations from coding errors **

A simple tension for all participants is that of not being able to achieve goals due to coding errors. While the concept of learning from failure is well worn, the demotivating effect of mistakes that appear unpenetrable to solution was both palpable and time consuming to address. In our context of the glitch.com web coding tool, code syntax errors would often result in a blank white screen. As a counterpoint to this kind of blank screen error were *glitches*. Here the result often retains a recognisable link to the intended effect, but with some unexpected behavior or characteristic. The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce these glitches and their unintended effects in game play. For example when adding a new enemy a glitch would be that they enemy did not zap a player in the way it was intended to. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful.

Next Steps  -----------

As per the timeline of my RD1 I will continue to iterate the design of the programme and record data as detailed above during the next academic year 2019-2020. There is one alteration; development and revision of the programme is happening concurrently to programme delivery via response to in-session feedback and participant interviews rather than separate design sessions outlined in the original.

While, data from in-depth interviews, in-situ observations and conversations with participants have proven to be a extremely rich source of material for revisions to the design, much of this has been on an ad-hoc basis. Two attempts at more to gather design suggestions outside of the making context were less successful. My impression is that participants lacked the language and confidence to fully participate. As such, I will create activities to develop the co-design faculties of participants and to integrate more feedback processes into each session to bring the process more inline with an expansive learning principles outlined in the methodology section.

I will work with university colleagues to further develop a drama process incorporating playful ways to increase a feeling of authenticity within project work. I will incorporate more elements of the Mantle of the Expert approach []{#ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION {"citationID":"CrTkgg60","properties":{"formattedCitation":"(Heathcote and Herbert, 1985)","plainCitation":"(Heathcote and Herbert, 1985)","noteIndex":0},"citationItems":[{"id":374,"uris":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/5EPEW6N2"],"uri":["http://zotero.org/users/1913249/items/5EPEW6N2"],"itemData":{"id":374,"type":"article-journal","title":"A drama of learning: Mantle of the expert","container-title":"Theory into Practice","page":"173–180","volume":"24","issue":"3","source":"Google Scholar","shortTitle":"A drama of learning","author":[{"family":"Heathcote","given":"Dorothy"},{"family":"Herbert","given":"Phyl"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1985"]]}}}],"schema":"https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json"} RNDvuf8cH7Mn1}(Heathcote and Herbert, 1985), specifically in the way in which participants are given challenges to allow them to inhabit the decision-making processes of professionals. My goal here is to facilitate more opportunities for reflection and collaboration between participants.

My work on supporting resources in the form of a starting game code framework, tutorials and supporting code examples, which had been in active development in previous iterations of workshop delivery, has now stabilised. This stability will allow me to give a greater focus to studying the way parents and young people interact with these resources to achieve personal and group goals. I have previously noted parents use of resources to redirect young people's attention to their goals; I am now particularly interested in the way young people demonstrate evidence of their initial goal setting and revision of aims through their interaction with these resources.

In terms of data analysis, my next challenge is the triangulation of the diverse data gathered around critical moments of participant experience. Based on the foundational literature explored above and my journal entries I will evolve a coding structure for workshop and participant interview recordings structured around AT and discourse analysis. I will use the software package NVivo to record and code research data from key moments of interactions and participant interviews.
