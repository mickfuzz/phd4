    1.  Aims of Study          --------------

> *The focus of this study is on collaborative production in family > learning environments. I plan to approach it from constructivist, > sociocultural perspectives.*

Based on need of RSC games in computing , and evidence that choice increases motivation and playfulness, and need to incorporate home learning into educational projects.

Aims are how to leverage power of game making, designing for choice and learning communities to develop collaboration & meta cognition skills.

Research Questions

-   What methods currently exist to facilitate collaborative learning in     > digital game making environments

-   What factors should be considered when designing for participant     > choice in digital game making environments?

-   What effect does family involvement have on the potential for     > collaborative pedagogical approaches to digital game making?

-   What effect does a pedagogical model focused on collaborative design     > learner choice have on parent and child learner experience of     > digital game making ?

-   What is the relationship between learner choice and collaborative     > potential in creative production processes?

    2.  Literature Review         -----------------

### Game Making Overview / Introduction

Reviews of learning dimensions (Earp, 2015; Kafai and Burke, 2015), find some dimensions are relatively well established, computing knowledge & subject knowledge.

-   Examples game making to support computing Logo / Papert, Scratch     > Resnick,

-   Game making to build subject knowledge; maths, natural science

However social / C21 skills including communication and collaboration are less researched, chiefly mentioned as a by-product rather than primary topic of research. An outcome of less priority for such skills in school cultures of individualised assessment (Rogoff, 2003).

In article movement from tools to communities (Kafai and Burke, 2014). the authors acknowledge the influence and of the socio-cultural schools on conceptions of learning

### Social, Collaboration and Choice 

Social aspects vs Personal aspects of learning even conceptions of group work

Collaboration spectrum -- participation to project work to Joint Problem Spaces in problem solving collaboration and negotiation as a key part of collaboration, open problems (Jordan, 2004; Roschelle and Teasley, 1995)

Helping strategies in digital environments, Barron and Roque (Barron et al., 2009; Roque et al., 2016). Using these as a basis for analysis of data.

**Designing educational settings for choice**

Rogoff (1994) in her development of the concept of communities of learners, advocates superseding idea of a spectrum of adult-controlled, instruction based environments and an oppositional conception of child-controlled, exploration based environments.

Rogoff outlines personal, social and community learning planes (1993). and associated terms of guided participation.

### Digital Making, Family and Professional Contexts

For this study the wider community can be considered to be the contexts of digital family learning in the home, retro game playing and wider game making communities of indy games.

Such an area suits an ecological approach to research and our understandings of the learning happening from Rogoff

Some relevant contextual factors that may

-   parental anxiety surrounding digital activity

-   The incorporation of the video game console back into family life in     > response to fragmentation (Chambers, 2012).

-   the role of children as the technology experts in some households     > (Correa et al., 2015; Roque et al., 2016).

-   video game play seen as positive for communication bringing families     > closer together (Itō et al., 2010).

Ito describes a spectrum from participation to to creative production and sees the family environment as a suitable spaces for exploratory messing around (Itō, 2009, p. 44)

### Tensions of Formal & Informal Dimensions & Play as a Solution

Explore the challenge of creating a learning community which brings elements of the informal, ecological into a new environment (Linehan and McCarthy, 2001).

Similar challenge faced by museams and informal learning spaces wanting to design for choice and draw on family experiences (Crowley and Jacobs, 2002; Petrich et al., 2013) as funds of knowledge (Moll et al., 1992).

Bevan and colleagues at the Exploratorium museum in San Fransciso have developed a framework which explores social aspects of tinkering (Bevan et al., 2015, p. 53; Petrich et al., 2013) notably social learning forms a great part of this framework, and is thus inspirational for this study.

**Play as a Strategy\ **Play offers a way to structure interventions without squeezing the fun out of them.

-   Definition on of play, voluntary, based on choice

-   Playful learning approaches & environments

**LINK:** Challenging from a learning design viewpoints, but also requires a different method of assessment / research. A way of describing complex learning environments in detail.

###  

### Activity Theory and Informal Learning Contexts

Background of socio cultural approaches. Engestrom linking US and Russian schools.

Overview of parts of AT and third model

Expansive conception of learning and why particularly suited to this intervention.

As the goals of the individuals and the families involved may change as they deepen their participation in the programme. Or shift in and out of individual focus (creativity), family focus, group focus (advance joint learning of creating a game as a group of learners).
