## Introduction to broad context

In this thesis, I explore digital game making as a vehicle for inclusive pedagogy to coding fluency and participation in coding practices. The potential of digital game making is explored in depth in a review by Kafai and Burke [-@kafai_constructionist_2015]. The most prominent learning objective of making games in educational setting is to develop _coding and computing skills_. There are extensive studies on _game making to learn other subjects_ including maths, biology and chemistry but diverse examples exist. Game making can also develop social skills, self-reflection, cultural awareness and a range of technical abilities that allow participation in information society. They are also a powerful vehicle for exploring issues involving race, sex, social issues [@tekinbas_quest_2010]. While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research.

In line educational research which highlights the important of learning contexts, my own interest is on the process of the creation and evolution of game making cultures. The development of agency in the participation in game making communities is of particular interest to me. This interest stems in part from my desire to develop learner agency in my wider work on student project-based approaches in higher education and STEM education, and also in part from my past involvement in grass-roots music and campaigning projects. The next section is a summarise the root of this interest through an exploration of my personal context.


<!-- New software tools to make games which offer new pedagogical possibilities emerge regularly. Game playing practices and the opportunities provided by participation in wider communities also continue to evolve. For example, casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014]. My study, in part, asks how the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities can be brought into more structured educational environments.    -->




## Personal context and motivation for undertaking this study

<!-- In 1995, as anyed recent graduate and new editor of a fanzine on the fledling electronic music scene centred around the Hulme venues of the Nia centre and New Adri, I was directed to this centre as it had the software Abiword which had the ability to print out rounded text boxes, a feature I thought would look pretty snazzy cut and pasted over over-photocopied backgrounds from 2000AD. No physical place in the UK seemed to better live out the counter-cultural, dystopian, cyberpunk ethic popularised by 2000AD and the author William Gibson. -->

<!-- In the middle of regenerated Hulme on the corner opposite the Birley fields campus is a squat unassuming building called the church of the Ascension. It is notable Apart from being  a site of sanctuary for the political refugee Viraj Mendis in a notable anti-deportation campaign of the 1980s, it was also the site of one of Europe's first electronic village halls, Hulme Community
##  Computing Centre. Here a encouraged me to make a website a music fanzine I edited, giving me a print out on how to write HTML web pages and offering free space as part the projects website. This spirit of peer-learning combined with my desire to share the ethos of the DIY music scene fuelled many years of using the internet to promote unlicensed music events. In 1995, the internet, like Hulme, seemed to be a corporate free space, a space for oddballs, niche enthusiasts and more importantly activists. This period saw increasing alignment with the growth of the internet to link up activities of disparate political and cultural groups around gatherings international finance institution (IFIs). For me this culminated in helping to organise and promote an event for June 18th 1999. Similar carnival-themed events drew on the blue print of reclaim the streets mixing street blockaded by outdoor sound systems. While the site of street party and protests as a chaotic and inspirational environment has been explored [@carmo_reclaim_2012; @jordan_notes_2005]. -->

In 1995, the internet seemed to me almost free of corporate messages. It was a space for oddballs, niche enthusiasts and more importantly activists. As someone involved with counter culture and political activism, the growth of the internet offered huge potential. I was involved in the resultant linking of activities of disparate political and cultural groups around gatherings international finance institution (IFIs). I found the, so-called, party and protest movement an inspirational site of learning. My involvement with the movement led me to help develop my internet publishing skills aligning myself with a broad network of media and internet activists centred around the Indymedia project [@pickard_united_2006]. On a personal level, my development as a media activist including but not limited to: graphic design; web page creation; computer programming; video editing; audio-visual events tech; and server maintenance was driven with motivation and support provided by people involved in that scene. As time developed, my activist activities aligned with arts techniques, integrating performance art and activist outreach particularly at film screenings. I enjoyed being part of a wide network of activists embracing playful, performance based actions and activism [@klepto_making_2004; @routledge_sensuous_2012].

There was a resonance between the non-hierarchical approach of activist spaces and the decentralised organising principles of the free software movement and the associated free culture approaches [@lessig_free_2004]. The ethos and new uses of technology of these networks and was something that I wanted to share with local networks and organisations. I developed a specialism in internet and media creation training and community development as paid activity to support my environmental and migrant-rights activism. I set up and ran three media centres. The first at an activist social centre, another for Community Arts Northwest and the last for People's Voice Media in Salford.

I documented and promoted low-cost media and web production processes in as a member of with FLOSS Manuals and Transmission international networks. As part of this process I co-wrote A Open Web which celebrated the opportunities of the decentralised, even playing field provided by open source web technology and processes.

<!-- In 2001 later after working as a teacher, and being immersed in the party and protest scene I returned to Manchester and found a home in the Redbricks estate. Since 1999 local residents had rented a pre broadband T2 internet collection and used linux servers and snaking, self-made  network cables across roads, through roof spaces, to share this connection for affordable prices. Pete helped set up our connection for a home office for a new internet project called Beyond TV which was a pre-YouTube internet sharing site off shoot of the Undercurrent VHS magasine video activist project [^4].   -->

<!-- The reality that the police and wider authorities had just been letting direct actions happen and even instigating some of them was stark. -->

In 2011, it was revealed that several activist groups I had been involved with were infiltrated by an undercover police officer (Mark Kennedy / Stone)[^1]. While I had suspected undercover police interest in our work previously, the extent and proximity of this infiltration still had a significant impact on me. My role in outreach for this movement became very uncomfortable as it became clear to extent to which participation in this movement came with hidden risks. The ongoing news of further police infiltration of activist networks, and the use of undercover police staff developing personal relationships with activist to further spy on and disrupt to community [^2], took a heavy toll on my mental health and my world outlook.

Our attempts to create systemic change were being countered with response from the state who were far better resourced than we were. The momentum of this movement had been in part by driven by new uses of technology and grass-roots organising processes. There were responses from both governmental and corporate institutions using legislative, intimidatory and other tactics. For example, Mark Kennedy / Stone's moved from police to a private firm spying for corporate clients on similar networks. While an inquiry on undercover policing scandal dragged with little to show for it, policing legislation of protest movements continues apace. The growth of the open web as a means for more egalitarian and non-corporate means of publishing was also attacked. A process exemplified by the embrace, extend & extinguish [^3] tactic. The open posting Indymedia network became difficult to maintain in part due to extensive posting of misinformation and ad-hominem attacks from suspicious sources, an early example of state-sponsored troll farms targetting community activism on social media [Jensen].   

<!-- Jensen, Michael (September 24, 2018). "Russian Trolls and Fake News: Information or Identity Logics?". Journal of International Affairs. 71 (1.5): 115–124. -->

<!-- Project-based community and communications felt rewarding but the legs of community-based adult education were being cut off by the coalition government. -->
<!-- My response was to shift focus towards community work and training and documentation work with international networks and then eventually to informal learning of media creation with young people and families. While this move was a retreat from other domains in part driven by painful experiences outlined above, my shift of interest towards young people and family was a positive and strategic shift to align with my new role as a university tutor in education and as a new parent. -->

<!-- There are positive elements to this otherwise sad story. My experiences have helped focus my interests on how change can happen and happen quickly when new opportunities become available to a community eager to use them. They also caution against unrealistic expectations of systemic change when faced with opponents with deep pockets and extensive resources. I would like to communicate a pragmatic approach of finding the limits of your agency, strategically pushing against them, and cautiously observing what happens. An informed activism built on a critical view of the nature of the system in question. -->

In response to growing discomfort around involvement in political and environmental activism, I shifted focus towards less _frontline_ activities.
community work and training and documentation work with international networks and then eventually to informal learning of media creation with young people and families A key vehicle for this work was FLOSS Manuals where I wrote and promoted documentation and online learning resources media creation and and collaborative processes using Free Software. This work gave me access to diverse international networks whose work was informed by participatory and egalitarian methods. One partnership was Mozilla Webmaker education programme. Webmaker involved creating tools and workshops guides with networks of informal educators. The motivation was to involve teens in being web literate through making web products inspired in part by Douglas Rushkoff's call for everyone to know at least a little bit of coding [@rushkoff_program_2010].

    And as we move into an increasingly digital reality, we must learn not just how to use programs but how to make them. In the emerging highly programmed landscape ahead, you will either create the software or you will be the software. It's really that simple: Program, or be programmed. [@rushkoff_program_2010].

This avenue offered a positive way to discuss the politics of independent communications and an empowerment agenda. The rhetoric accompanying the launch of a new curriculum promised the ability to undertake game and media project production as a way to increase learners authentic real-world programming skills through creating authentic projects [@livingstone2010next]. This motivation as well as the reduction in funding for adult education austerity agenda, led me to retrain. I undertook a masters in Computing and then an PGCE in teaching Computing. During my PGCE year I found it challenging to bring in the kind of project based learning techniques to the classroom, a theme explored in this thesis.

I did however manage to create a pilot scheme to teach javascript in playful ways, using Mozilla's webmaker tools and ethos, which I trialled in the classroom and wrote up as a dissertation and published the results as an addition to the Mozilla's online teaching resources. While the context of secondary schools within which I trained did not suit creative project based approaches, a new role Manchester Met University role doing community partnerships as part of their EdLab project [^4] did provide opportunities to pursue this work.

SHIFT The turn to investigate game creation as a creative media project stemmed a consultation with home educators partnership work. To align with the interests of parents and children at the consultation asked if we could lead activities which drew on interest in games like Minecraft to start to do computer coding.

The shift from making web-based media to games made sense given the patch success I had had with web coding pages with school children. Rather than using media to mobilise and feed into social movements, games became a medium to explore and create as a playful educational experience. Both were grounded in self-expression, participatory culture and I was to find out both could use similar technology.

<!-- To inform this work I returned to Mozilla's web developer resources to discover two step-by-step tutorials outlining how to game making in the browser using a javascript library called Phaser.  -->

<!-- I was able to combine my work using the code playground Thimble with the js library Phaser to create an potentially accessible toolset for young learners. -->


**Contextual details aligning with personal motivations**

Fluency with the focus on personal expression aligns with motivation of empowerment and equality of access not only to future employment but a broader participation on a digital society. This agenda has parallels with other domains of participatory culture involving music and protest culture that I have been involved in.

<!-- - DIY music and protest event organisation
- Participatory media making for social and environmental causes
- Documentation writing using collaborative processes
- Creative coding -->

In summary, as a Computer teacher candidate I was drawn to the possibilities offered by a new technologies and the shifts in computer pedagogy. In the reality of schools that I taught in working within the constraints of the curriculum, exams and competing pressures for time worked together to prevent the kind of authentic activities that first attracted me.

However, a new position as a project work for EdLab allowed me the ability to explore this outside of the classroom in more innovative programs and partnerships.

### Revisiting my overall aim in relation to the process of this chapter and RQs


The use of new technologies by communities to achieve new aims. New technology can provide communities with tools to leverage new opportunities in a way which gives participants greater agency. Community-based approaches to learning can facilitate this process. The process of learn through undertaking creative media projects is explored in existing PBL literature but more work is needed which share effective practice. This study, in part, explores ways in which how the motivational and navigational affordances of enthusiast game making communities can be brought into more structured educational environments.

RQ2 explores this with a focus on the use of game design patterns, a concept used in both professional and enthusiast settings.

#### The complex role of agency in this thesis

RQ3 addresses the process of developing agency within a community.

My personal context is an example that changes happening within one system may cause a reaction from wider system elements and actors, which pushes back to reverse the initial changes. My story illustrates the 'risky' process of collective agency working on objectives that may run away to involve unforeseen outcomes [@edwards2009systemic, p. 200]. On a personal level, I want to transcend feelings of regret associated with not being wary enough of unintended effects of embracing possibilities for social change offered new technologies.

The link with this thesis here is that the process of community change can be rapid and transformational and that greater understanding of the processes involved are of value. Thus, a wider goal is the research is to reflect on experiences of developing agency. While agency and autonomy have disputed, often inter-related definitions [@huang_autonomy_2013; @matusov_mapping_2016]. This study uses the following terms which can help locate RQ3 more precisely:
instrumental agency, relational agency and authorial agency.  

 <!-- To address this Summary of what is in Ch.3 -->

While RQ3 is necessarily limited in the extent it directly addresses forms of agency. The surfacing of my conflicted understandings of the experimental change need to acknowledged here for context as they do emerge in the way I locate the findings in relation to other research in later chapters.


## Conceptual Context


### The utility of understanding projects and socio cultural and activist concepts of activity

In this section I briefly explain CHAT as a suitable choice to explore this research based around a shared project.

I also problematise educational projects beyond the sometimes superficial take on educational project in schools with wider concepts derived from the socio cultural tradition.

While the kind of learning explored in this study may not traditionally be thought of as an activist project, I find synergies between activist conceptions of education and learning and my wider concerns in a modest but achievable way. Specifically as a desire to move beyond curricular and technical concepts of computational thinking to wider concerns based on empowerment [@lee_none_2016].   

In addition the wider framework of CHAT is optimistic but realistic in the focus on the possibility of change.

This process links back to my own feelings of entrapment, powerlessness and guilt after being involved with wider activist movements and projects. I want to be able to give detailed tools of critically analysis that do not paralyse but also do not unthinkingly evangelise social change in ways which may be unsafe or unrealistic.


## Context of teaching and learning coding via game making


While there has been a large body of research on the value and practice of game making for educational purposes, it is a dynamic landscape which has many areas which merit additional research. New software tools to make games which offer new pedagogical possibilities emerge regularly. Game playing practices and the opportunities provided by participation in wider communities also continue to evolve. For example, casual and retro games played by both adults and children are increasingly available via smart phones and home consoles. The nostalgia around such games and the associated aesthetics of cuteness creates a potential for connection between younger and older players [@boyle_retro-futurism_2017]. The sustained popularity of retro games together with easy-to-use game making tools and code frameworks provides an entry point for game players into game making cultures which is reflected in the success of amateur games publishing websites like itch.io [@garda_nostalgia_2014].

### Overview and motivations of game making (for learning)

The title of Kafai and Burke's book "Connected Gaming: What Making Video Games Can Teach Us about Learning and Literacy" [@kafai_connected_2016]  indicates their desire to mirror Gee's work around the importance of context and community the process of game making. The structure of the book revolves around studying personal, social and cultural element of game making. In doing so the authours outline motivations for learning to code specifically via game making. Which are in summary:

- for intrinsic pleasure of making games or other products
- for commercial purposes to join games industry
- STEM pipeline in more general terms
- for empowerment of individual and health of society

also

    - From Kafai's review (not directly) draw on
    - personal
    - more general / social / 21st C, computational fluency
    - more general / social / 21st C,
    - Computational Fluency - expression [@bers_coding_2021; @resnick_closing_2001; @resnick_fulfilling_2017]

While this book is rightly regarded a  keystone work in this area the coverage of the cultural elements of game making is not as strong as other aspects focusing mainly on studies of diverse participants rather than sharing culturally focused pedagogies.

## Context of game making for curricular purposes

The context of many studies of game making to learning either computer science or other subject knowledge in curricular for the most part happens in a school or after school environment.

### Computing as a School Subject in the UK

The influential report "Next Gen: Transforming the UK into the world’s leading talent hub for the video games and visual effects industries" was focused on providing the UK games and animation industry with the talent needed to succeed [@livingstone_next_2011]. The top recommendations were to include computer science in core curriculum, introduce a new Computing GCSE (a general exam for 16 year olds before they progress to more specialised study) exam, offer bursaries for computing teachers and to implement well-supported use of games and visual animation in the school curriculum as a way to attract more young people to the subject.

The After the Reboot report [@waite_pedagogy_2017], returned to the subject of game making as a way of increasing engagement in the process of coding. The review highlighted several areas of promise which needed more research: using games for engagement, use of design patterns - a term explored later in this chapter - and the involvement of girls in coding and social and cultural aspects of coding. The "After the Reboot" report also contained concerning observations. The report found that girls, ethnic minorities, and students of lower socio-economic status were all less likely to take computing as a subject at GCSE level. Game making aligns well with the principles of inclusive practices and project-based learning (PBL). It provides: learner choice in projects which increases motivation; authentic and shareable project outcomes to encourage peer feedback and reflection;  iterative projects work supporting student mastery; and challenging goals and guidance in goal setting aiding self-regulation in learners.


<!-- The benefits of game making aligns with those of wider creative computing projects. There has been extensive publication on computing education and techniques aimed to support teachers often new to the subject. These include a new website with materials, including quick guides and writing around a set of 12 computing principles.
A lot of this literature is aimed at helping teachers in a classroom context and with a focus of explaining and exploring computing context.
MORE ON THIS - OTHER TIPS FROM NCCE AND LINKS TO RESOURCES.
BUT NOT TOO MUCH
While projects are mentioned as a principle that allows learners to deepen their understanding on computing concepts by putting them into practice. There is less on specifics of how teachers can support project work or indeed how to best develop resources to support project work in schools. -->
<!-- One of the recommended strategies is a Game Jam which focuses on real life issues.

-->


## Context of digital making and culture in informal settings

The context of these communities is important to situate the relevance of this study. These contexts are explored in summary.

While key pedagogies used in this area are explored in chapter two, at times context and pedagogy are not neatly separated. Thus in this section brief summaries of strategies are sometimes included to be explored in more depth in Chapter 2.


### Context of authenticity of tools, practices and relationship with agency and empowerment

Later in this thesis I problematise the use of the work authentic in learning [@lee_none_2016]. In this introduction I refer making games that will be played by audience of friends and family and using tools used beyond the scope of education, professional communities.  

In additions, the practices of code patching and remixing are authentic skills used by professional coders who find and combine existing code libraries rather than coding everything from scratch.

**Authentic web technology**


<!-- Javascript is an authentic language, core the web. Phaser is a professional and enthusiast framework.  -->

<!-- Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals. -->


<!-- Aligning with the activities of Nicola Whitton exploring the rules and components of games in a playful way. -->

In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity. The motivation was to align to authentic web technology due to my previous experience. The reason for working with code this authentic bears exploration. Characteristics of broader dimensions of authenticity of tools and processes in learning environments are explored in the literature review. A brief summary being: similarity to workplace settings; facilitating activity which serves a need of participants; an ability to showcased resulting work to an audience [@shaffer_thick_1999; @warr_bridging_2020]. While my choice of open source digital tools allowed for a high level of aligning with professional practices, it was also potentially complex in terms of use of tools. In part my motivation for choice of code language (Javascript, Phaser) was driven by desire to align with common workplace practices and to be potentially extensible for future student-led web projects.

**Mozilla - Teach the Web as context and community**

A Mozilla white paper [@mozilla_foundation_webmaker_2014] outlines the power of exploring web technology as an empowering activity. My own work in this area has been informed by work developing teaching materials for the Mozilla Foundation as part of the Teach the Web programme.

The tools created by Mozilla to investigate and to remix HTML pages scaffolded the experiences of new learners and paralleled  my own early experiences of self-expression through hacking a new technology. My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics and Scratch.



 <!-- This programme introduced a broad set of competencies name Web Literacies including; digital literacy
- web literacy - narrower
- webmaker - and more specific affordances of key web based coding and exploring tools -->

I contributed to the Mozilla teach the web programme by writing a course called Quacking Javascript. My report on the underlying pedagogical approach outlines the following possibilities; playful approach, use of online games, use of popular culture references to increase engagement [@chesterman_webmaking_2015].  

#### Code playgrounds

Glitch is a code playground which while used for learning and which was chosen by Mozilla as a replacement tool for the education focused Thimble, is also used by professionals. In the early selection of tools the use of a framework based on javascript and web technology is driven by authenticity and thus an ability . My work on teach the web for Mozilla was motivated in part in the extensibility of this choice of language which can be compared to block based environments or game specific making tools like game-star mechanics.

MOVE TO LR.
The process of running web code can be complicated by setting up a server environment locally to test and then finding a live webserver and the complexity of transferring files to the server via FTP/SSH processes. . Code playground allow users to circumvent such problems. While originally designed more for problem solving, a service more recent code playgrounds provide is to act as a more permanent host for web projects.  

In their brand style and selected  picks of projects, many code playgrounds celebrate and encourage a playful spirit of creativity and sharing.

<!-- NOTE  - I loved FTP and feel nostalgic? perhaps rfer back to that in conclusion? -->

<!-- DROPPED -  There are strong parallels in this presentation to that Scratch community and to the sharing ethos integral to the maker-movement (explored in Lit Review). The interplay between play and work via shared experimentation is developed further in a later discussion chapter. -->

<!-- #### Other online asset creation tools

There are other ways to create assets online. Piskel is a pixel graphics editor, audio creation of assets. These tools are provided by a mix of enthusiast coders and communities of game makers. ### Mozilla, Webmaking and code playgrounds

#### Phaser.js

While the Webmaker program was discontinued and the end of a funding cycle, ongoing core work of Mozilla to provide resources for webdevelopers. One strand of this is game development using javascript  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games

Mozilla chose phaser as a javascript library/ framework (see Glossary). Phaser is a javascript framework embedded in html page. Unlike many game making tools this tools set can be extended to other kinds of projects and is a professional and foundational toolset used to build the majority of websites and many phone applications.

#### Summary of authenticity- COMMENT OR MOVE

Javascript as coding language, Phaser as a game making framework and Glitch as a code environment, are highly authentic and used by both professional coders and enthusiasts alike. -->



## Digital gaming and making culture


Building on the concept of participatory culture [@jenkins_confronting_2009], where x and y, there are several streams of activity that are important to reference as foundational context for this study.

### On  Gaming (move to a gaming cultures section? )

The work of Livingstone is foundational in the area of home learning of digital technologies[@livingstone_digital_2018].

Research exploring home game playing and digital activity uncovers material that families may bring into a non-formal game making process.


One of the reasons that I was interested to shift to game making was the potential that seemed to be present for intergenerational work based around retro gaming based on its place in public memory [@heineman_public_nodate]. The place in public memory of retro games is complex but for older participants, the effect of nostalgia is significant.

What era and technologies constitute retro games can be disputed, however for this study I use a definition of early arcade games from the 1970s and early 1980s and early generation of home consoles Atari 2600, Nes, Snes and Megadrive before the advent of 3D graphics.

Retro games have a particular aesthetic driven by graphical limitations and the simplified game mechanics which are
due to the limited capabilities of the hardware and storage space involved.



### Home making and consuming of media


Messing around and affinity groups. Ito's work on  and naturalistic studies of digital use and creativity in the home including the value of informal playing around [@ito_connected_2013-1; @ito_hanging_2010], and Gee and the process of tapping into affinity groups and affinity spaces [@gee_what_2004].  Gee's (2004b) work on games and associated culture as learning experiences is founded on his understanding of how the engender a shared discourse and emerging identities .

In addition, maker culture more generally is relevant due to the alignment with tinkering as educational practice in stem education, supported by family involvement and brokering of experiences. The details of tinkering as a pedagogical practice are explored in more detail in the literature review of this thesis.


## Context of Home Education and family learning

The move to family learning as a context suited the trajectory of my interests and the opportunities available as part of University context.

Many professional programmers began with support provided by family.

Barron and Livingstone have outlined the advantages and processes involved in family involvement of technology use and learning in the home. There is clearly an inequality of access to these well paid profession that the development of the computing curriculum and the skills based and creative process focus that was part of the initial narrative is laudable the aims of equality.

However the practical and and cultural difficulties of undertaking a project-based approach withing the curriculum are significant. Factors of difficulties associated with technology projects compound difficulties.

In this research I made the decisions not to focus on the adaptation  of a  informal club approach to the restrictions of in-school classes but rather instead to embrace key elements of it and to explore processes in situ. While the context of home education is not a core to the goals of this research it is important to situate this study accurately.

**Outline of the home eduction context of this study:** The processes and motivations driving of home education are varied [@fensham-smith_invisible_2021]. Classic ideas of reasons for HE include pedagogy and ideology [@galen_home_1991] [@rothermel_can_2003], and often both. My involvement with home ed networks stemmed from University outreach work. In the following section I draw on relevant research to identify characteristics and motivations of the networks and families that I tapped into.

- Unschooling, Holt, drawing out interests of children in everyday activities and facilitating learning around that [@gray_challenges_2013]
- Webs of learning Illich - home ed families active in identifying networks to tap into [@doroudi_relevance_2023] has a relevance with social networking groups and email lists used by home educators to share and align activities.




## Review of relevant barriers to participating in coding practices emerging in the literature

<!-- NOTE - THIS IS ALSO IN THE DESIGN CHAPTER
CHOOSE CAREFULLY WHERE TO PUT THE RESULTS. -->


This section draws on concepts of the introductory section to review existing research on digital making to identify barriers to participation in digital making and in particular coding practices.


Here, the term barrier is used in a general way. In the next chapter it will be examined with greater criticality.

<!-- NOTE: there is overlap here with contextual factors in the introduction and with the new direction of chapter 4 - probably move a lot of this.  

This section then which summarises existing research in this area needs a clear and different focus.
-->



##  Barriers

### Technical Barriers -  Difficulties in learning to program

Summary here [@gomes2007learning] [@joao_cross-analysis_2019]. and here

    <!-- Through a literature review on this topic, we aim to organize and   systematize the main difficulties into four dimensions of analysis: (i) subject and complexity of languages; (ii) technologies and applications; (iii) teachers and teaching methodologies; and (iv) pupils’ skills[@joao_cross-analysis_2019] -->

In particular, the dilemma between more authentic languages and block based approaches [@joao_cross-analysis_2019].

More literature which examines the complexity of language and development environments should be found here.

Complexity of syntax and problem of leading with syntax [@gomes2007learning]

Issues of needing levels of abstraction in learning programming [@gomes2007learning].


*Specialist coding tools and computational kits*

There may software and hardware kits aimed at novice coders and in particular younger audience [@yu_survey_2018].

This section briefly summarises some of the adaptation in particular, that software has undergone to adapt to this audience.

Much work has been taken out by MIT family developing Papert's ideas on constructionism in tool use

 - Block coding vs text coding, syntax
 - Design principles for game making tools, [@kafai_connected_2016; @resnick_reflections_2005] ()
 - Barriers in using support material for code examples- mapping, understanding, [@wang_novices_2021]


Scratch and GSM merit particular examination as mini-case studies. The  

- Scratch and community element.
- Remix as a feature: [@amanullah_evaluating_2019]
- Online log in
- library of assets to speed up creation
- In built asset authoring tools.

Game star Mechanic added quest ability, and a narrative set in a steam punk aesthetic. Of interest to this study are the motivational use of narrative, and accompanying resources which help analysis of game design patterns and systems based challenges.

### Cultural / Identity barriers to participation in ...

**Barriers to participation**

Develop from introduction, move to a overview of literature which addresses  barriers in participation in coding communities from literature.

The focus of this review is to identify broad streams and currents in research.


#### Barrier - Identity and computer cultures

Early work from Papert and Turkle addresses cultural barriers to computing culture [-@papert_epistemological_1990]. The distinction between hard and soft approaches to learning is explored particularly in studies refuting conceptions that there is a right way to do computer coding. In this context, the hard approach infers a top-down perspective, highlighting advance planning and logical deconstruction of large problems. Papert and Turkle identify the privileging of abstract thinking over concrete approaches in classroom teaching a tendency which is mirrored by recent conceptions and advancement of computational thinking as teaching ideology [@wing_computational_2008].

Paper and Turkle locate different, softer but equally effective coding strategies. Soft coding suggests a more immediate and learner-directed connection with the materials or digital artefacts involved. The learner is presented as adapting a familiar set of concepts and processes to new situations and challenges as they arise as a 'tinker' might use well worn tools to skilfully bodge a repair job [@papert_childrens_1993, p. 143].

Kafai and Peppler also address the issues of gender identities and game design [@kafai_beyond_2014] asking how to create new communities and learning environments which align with values of participants rather than aiming to break into existing ones. They propose that we ask not *How can we bring girls into the game making clubhouse* but rather *How can we build new clubhouses suitable for the interests of girls*. Two of the playful elements they suggest are textiles related technology and the promotion of more collaborative online spaces as opposed to technology competitions.

<!-- #### Barrier - Unfamiliarity with design process due to instruction based schooling systems

When faced with choice learners are sometimes unsure how to start creating.
Design scaffolds have been created to support this. -->




### Barrier - unfamiliarity with support practices

While home education support practices of families are expressed in this setting, a computing context requires specific support techniques that may be unfamiliar to parents [@roque_engaging_nodate; @roque_becoming_2018].




 <!-- Low floors: a tool that is intuitive enough to allow new users to acclimate to it gradually and with a degree of confidence.
 High ceilings: a tool that also allows more experienced users to create constructs (in this case, video games) that can grow increasingly complex and nuanced as one’s own proficiency increases.
 Wide walls: a tool that—in addition to low floors and high ceilings—allows its users to create a wide range a constructs, letting users tap into elements of personal experience as well as popular culture to design and develop something entirely unique and representative of their own interests and backgrounds.
 We added a fourth principle to emphasize the equally important social dimension of construction tools:11

 Open windows: a tool to facilitate the sharing of digital media. The creation of digital communities represents the new frontier in terms of making computer programming a more accessible skill for youths. -->





### Studies informing cultural barriers / aspects of game making

Illingworth critique's Kafai and Burke's book due to lack of specificity in the game making techniques outlined. This is particularly the case in chapter x which explores cultural elements of game making research. This observation may stem in part from a lack of concepts in constructionism to describe cultural elements of learning environments.


  **Studies exploring identity and barriers to participation**

  Game making is thus a suitable mediumn to support existing collaborative practices and home interests to overcome difficulties in computer coding.

  Issues of identities and barriers have been explored in relation to gender in terms of game making in several studies.
  REWRITE WITH CORRECT CITATIONS - ALSO INCLUDE THE GAME TESTERS OF BLACK STUDENTS.   

  **Gender related identities**

  The Girls Creating Games programme which asked similar questions concerning the impact of a Flash-based game programme on computer proficiency and desire to continue with computer studies Denner, 2007). Findings were again mixed but encouraging in some areas. While there was no increase in desire to persue computing, there were marked increases in computer related confidence, ability and a decrease in gender stereo typing around computer use.

  The issues of gender stereo-typing and identity in relation to computers were explored by Pelletier as part of the Making Games project using the Mission Maker software 2008).

  <!-- Data was recorded from two UK schools in an 18 month after school programme. Pelletier draws on the work of Butler 1988) to caution against overdue influence of a set conception of gender or cultural stereotypes, seeing gender as a personal and flexible product of continuing activities and interactions. In this study, she explored the promise of the process of game design and the analysis of gaming habits as a platform and set of tools for young participants to explore and construct their gender identity over time. This area is a rich seam to explore and a more recent study by Fisher and Jenson critically explored diverse themes through a summer game making programme 2017).

  **Research**
  Extensive research by Roberson on game making in schools measured gender differences in performance and attitudes to game making and computing in pre post tests [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_influence_2013].  

  The findings were mixed as while girls outperformed boys in use of computational structures, neither gender ended the programme with a greater desire to learn more about computers in the future.

  The Girls Creating Games programme which asked similar questions concerning the impact of a Flash-based game programme on computer proficiency and desire to continue with computer studies [@denner_girls_2007] .

  Research on making computing inclusive highlights the value personal expression within the process as a motivational factor [@robertson_making_2012; @robertson_adventure_2007].  



  **Race related identities**

  In study by Thayter and Ko [@thayer_barriers_2017] the work of Margolis et al is analysed using concepts from communities of practice, type of barriers, and personal obstacles [@margolis_stuck_2008;]

      Stuck in the Shallow End: Education, Race and Computing by Margolis, Estrella, et al. [ 12] examined the racial gap in high school CS, finding barriers that included lack of access to classes (formal boundary), cultural expectations on who the classes were for, feelings of isolation in classes, divisions within classes between those who “have it or don’t have it” (informal boundaries), and lack of social support(personal obstacle). Additional studies found participation and success in computing programs depended on background experience [ 2, 27 ], comfort level [ 27 ], sense of belonging and stereotypes (dis proportionately negatively affecting women) [ 2 , 5, 10, 16 ], view of self as an “insider” [21], and believed role of luck [27]

  I adopt a similar approach but use the language of AT contradictions, barriers and tensions.

## Case Studies
### 5th Dimension Case Study

Insert a summary of context, motivation and some of the processes to address cultural issues in 5th dimension project

A case studey from a socio-cultural perspective is exemplified by the 5th Dimension (5D) project led by Michael Cole [@cole_design-based_2016]. This educational intervention used University support of volunteers, equipment and technical support in after-school settings in the San Diego area.

The intervention introduced a fictional narrative to create a shared 'project' for the different participants involved to promote a shared understanding of the work via intentional goal setting [@brown_cultural_2008].

In the 5D intervention, a narrative fiction of a 'wizard' to rapidly construct a shared sense of the guiding activities. In similar approach to Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert, roles are created and breathed into life by the facilitator and affordances of the learning design to accelerate an adoption of principles of practice.

This technique emerged in this study as one of value and is explored in chapters x and y.

### Creative Family Learning - Roque



<!-- As Amy Bruckman pointed out, "tools are not enough... Tools are effectively constructionist only when they are embedded in a constructionist culture." (Bruckman, 1998, pp. 51-52) -->

There is limited research on how to create learning communities making games for educational purposes. Existing research [@xiao_fostering_2007] has close parallels with project approaches and has a focus on fostering online collaboration and resources sharing. Many popular and well researched online communities exist [scratch, itch.io, new grounds](Bruckman). However researchers [@roque_family_2016] highlighted the limitations of accessibility of online participatory culture. In response Roque [@roque_family_2016]  FCL study addressed it with face to face session with help from family members.  


Roque's work is founded on sociocultural / situated understandings of learning and brings it into a non-formal learning environment. A key question she asks is how can facilitators help develop participation in community activities [@roqueBecomingFacilitatorsCreative2018].


It is of value to explore the community aspect of providing support to parents, and support and structure to staff members supporting parents.

The work of Roque to operationalise Barron's work on parental roles in a making context is of particular interest to this study.

I extend this in this study, how can the learning design contribute to aid this process and empower young people as well.

## Summary of the thesis motivation and structure

### Recap of motivation

A motivation is to better understand my practice as an activist, community worker and educator.

While I am wary of runaway objects, I am still active in a community and university setting.

An understanding of this controlled experiment in creating culture can shed light on previous work.

Theories of situated learning view transmission of educational practice as a thorny problem as the process of learning is dependant on many contextual factors.

Thus why would this study based on observations of one context be of use?
Thoughts:  
  - similar contexts exist
  - underlying treads may emerge which may transcend context  

#### An area of tension to address - limited leaner choice in process if driven by curriculum.

Authors note that UMC and the value of project based exploration can clash with classroom culture driven by curriculum goals.

    "Constructionist learning experiences are often designed to give the learner agency in the activity, encouraging exploration throughout the process of constructing public and shareable artifacts [16, 26]. The open-endedness can be difficult to adhere to when used in a context where there are specific learning objectives or when trying to introduce new conceptual material or practices. Noss & Hoyles [24] call this the Play Paradox, an inherent tension between supporting a freedom of exploration while constraining the activity to ensure specific concepts or practices are encountered."

Quote from [@franklin_analysis_2020]


### Gaps in existing research / Contribution to knowledge of this thesis


Sharing practice for researchers and practitioners is complicated. The results are often too abstract to be useful or easily understood by practitioners or too concrete to replicate. Notable exceptions include design pattern collections and design heuristics like that of Brennan and Silverman [@resnick_reflections_2005]

**Gaps in research**
- Kafai's review on game making research is thin in cultural terms.
- Not many addressing the explicit intention to create a community.  
- Game design patterns emerged in this research as fruitful and is under researched


**Other thoughts on thesis**

This research is valid in the following ways:

- generative nature of research. It has created teaching resources
- the detail of game making pedagogy, suitable for other researcher and Teachers
- tools are novel - media practices are situated, thus will differ with technology
- application of guided participation as lens to this domain
- something about methods using 360 and screen capture?



### Research Questions

- What pedagogical tools and processes are available to support novices to overcome barriers to game coding and design?
<!-- - What pedagogical factors are significant to support novices learning coding, particularly in game making contexts? -->
- How can participants build agency in an evolving community of game makers?
- How can game design patterns support the development of coding practices with novices?


### Chapter outline

As has been outlined in this introduction the a leading thread of the thesis is my desire to better understand my own experience as a facilitator of learners creating media and digital products in relation with existing research. This chapter has been structured around key contextual factors that have spurred this inquiry and which have emerged from observational research and integrating existing theoretical understandings in this area. While the immediate goal of understanding learning happening in temporary informal environments of learning coding, the findings have implications that of interest to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners who are looking to nurture creative and/or technical design practices in novice learners.  

In line with a situated view of learning the details of process of coding are important. Thus one of the challenges of this work is to explore the details to a non-expert audience. While the literature review will begin to disambiguate some of the terms used in the thesis there is in addition a glossary which outlines short definitions of technical terms used. The glossary is included as an appendix to this study and a summary table is present as an introductory section to the literature review.

The literature review begins the exploration of the key themes and threads that are integral to the findings of this study. These include: authenticity in project based approaches; nature of informal settings in particular home education; barriers to participation in digital making; pedagogies to create inclusive learning environments and to help young people learn computer coding. To follow I outline the theoretical framework and the key methodologies of this study. I explain how the design based research (DBR) aligns well with the aims of the research questions and the use of concepts from the socio cultural school and the leading approach of third generation activity theory (3GAT).

<!-- In doing so I explore the direction of travel of 3GAT and increasing synergies with DBR as methodologies which suit both intervention by researchers into the learning environment being studies and corresponding input by research participants in the resulting design. -->

Chapter three starts with a summary of key concepts aligned with the theoretical framework to aid the analysis of data gathered. This include: the iterative and mutually created and emergent nature of the resources and processes that were created and adopted; identifying a unit of analysis; and transformative conceptions of agency. In the second part of the chapter, I outline the process of how data was gathered, processed and collected using screen capture and 360 cameras. I explore the challenge of gathering large amounts of research data and resulting prioritisation that resulted.   

 <!-- which had been inspired by partnership work between EdLab and the Biosocial Lab -->

Chapter four outlines the learning design that emerged from the research process. To explore emerging tensions in design in a way which communicates relevant context, I outline four conflicts in interrelated activity systems using the terminology of third generation activity theory (3GAT). This chapter discussion begins with an exploration of the tools used through the lens of authenticity. It continues by covering the mutual nature of the evolution of the design, and ends with a synthesis to initial barriers to engaging in game making practices and initial interventions to address them.

Chapter five focuses on the implementation of individual game design patterns (GDPs) and in doing so addresses how data gathered informs thinking on the research question - _how can game design patterns support the development of coding practices by novices_?
This chapter begins by re-examining of game design patterns and game play design patterns in the context of a community of novice coders. Following this a vignette of parent child interaction in game making process introduces an overview of interactions of that pair to help contextualise findings. The chapter then undertakes a systematic analysis of the use of game design patterns by participants drawing on detailed observations of practice. A discussion section explores implications and observations from these findings in relation to existing research and concepts.

Chapter six outline the use of inclusive pedagogical methods that helped participants become part of an emerging community of game makers. It explores the role of the design of games and the surrounding communities that build up around games to support an nurture the development of player identities. The process is shown to have beneficial effects in supporting the creative process. I explore the use of a process drama to draw on their existing knowledge and encourages them to put this into practice via a playful fictional scenario.

Chapter seven concludes the thesis with a final discussion on the significance of my findings in line with other research and discusses the limitations of this research and identifies areas for future work.

### Link to next chapter

It is worth noting at this stage that the process of being guided by personal interests, those of participants and creating and designing
This chapter has explored the context of HE, informal science learning and specifically computer coding and game making. The pedagogies of those areas are explored in the next chapter.
