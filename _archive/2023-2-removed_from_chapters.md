### Visual asset creation and selection   

- Mi's interactions around graphics creation - write up transcript
- Mi's exploration in others.

There was a high degree of personal expression through interaction with the process of creating visual assets in particular.

NOTE THE NEXT SECTION IS QUITE GENERAL MOVE TO START OF THIS SECTION OR LIT REVIEW?
The incorporation of the graphic was relatively quick and easy change to make the game but had a significant factor in the affect towards the game [erikssonUsingGameplayDesign2019;]

In this exerpt parent Mi has spent

    St:  That's Good!
    Mi: Oh do you like it?
    St: Yeah
    Mi: Thank you. I'm very proud of it. Concentrated extremely hard. The thing is, you can get quite consumed doing things like this can't you?
    St: Yeah
    Mi: That's the problem at home I get a bit kind of lost. I can't get the knack of some things. It takes me so long to get it. I'm like  so excited.   
    - Both laugh.
    St: So are you going to do bits at home? When the kids are..
    Mi: I tried and I lost it all. And you know when you just completely... And even Ne didn't know so I just ... what a shame..  hours ....
    Laughs

    Mi - Lost time. Never mind.  We live and we learn.   

    Mi – We’re finished.

    Mi  - Right what’s next? Now I’m an expert pixel?
    Mi – Now I have to figure out how to get it in there don’t I? Without losing it I’ll be very upset.
    St – Have you saved it?
    Mi – No I’ve not saved it.
    St – Save there. (points to relevant button on screen)

We can see Mi cultivating a sense of ownership over the graphical element that she has created. There is also the development of a growing sense of competency in this area of asset design.


#### Other examples of asset creation allowing personal expression

**Repurposing graphical assets  in a playful way**

Pair Sh and Th used a graphic of a cute dog as the background of their game.  

- playing around the graphic - covering it over and revealing it

The child expressed a lot of positive regard to this dog and used it a way to stimulate conversation about their home interest in dogs during play testing.
- participant self-expression and a conversational prompt to other during sharing of the game

The subject was completely unrelated to the previously stated theme of the game.
It may be the parent knew this was a way to sustain involvement and interest.

These interactions re sometimes playful, and sometimes chance to share something serious. It allows young person to talk about dogs and their love of dogs. Even at one point that they used to have two and one died.

**Audio assets**
In the second iteration of glitch game club participants were introduced to tools to create sounds and a free audio resource repository. This allowed for rapid, broad strokes personal expression in a similar way to the use of graphical elements.
Examples? Ru and Ro ? in one of the later weeks?

#### Discussion - on assets and participation

Cultural interactions seem to be able to motivate and sustain other interpersonal activity which may be experienced as work.
This is supported by other research on digital making and motivation. CITATION HERE? - or in cultural discussion?  

**Tangled nature of graphics and narrative in this design**
In the data analysed, young people


**Limitation of asset work as a GDP**
Note the limits of this interpretation.
While the reinterpretation of the MDA framework into a menu of GDP is practical for the elements that they want to change, it is not strictly a pattern to be implemented here.
A tension here to be briefly explored or noted to explore later.



### Discussion - types of blockages / error s

#### Discussion on nurturing tactical responses to blocks

 How do you develop a more granular sense of the kinds of blocks, errors and how to overcome them.

 Professionals build up this sense through experience. While some practices are taught many others become ad-hoc rules of thumb that are difficult to communicate in abstract ways.

 More research would be welcome on how to help learners pick up these understandings.
 Further analysis of the different kinds of errors that are likely to arrive and testing different strategies for dealing with them that take into account the zone or proximal development of the participants may provide not only useful input for the participants, but also opportunities to check understandings of processes and game patterns and computational patterns in use.

 Question - do more useful / less de-motivating errors result from remixing and game patching?

 Question - what impact does the process of being driven by GDPs have on how users deal with errors? PERHAPS EXPLORE LATER?


 Perhaps see the above glitch examples. Not fully understanding every line of code can create a fun, unpredictable environment. We can infer from these examples that wrong behaviour may be easier to investigate and to correct than no-behaviour errors. Aspects of the design encourage this kinds of error. Certainly the process of code patching does.

 <!-- ### On different kinds of snags / blockages

 PERHAPS MOVE BACK TO THE GDP CHAPTER IF SPACE?

 #### On Debugging and Embracing Different Types of Errors

 In analysis of journal notes and recorded screens I began to identify different kinds of problems that blocked participants from progressing. I refer to different kinds of blockages which result from tensions and contradictions between different elements in activity systems.

 Some blockages were non-technical including hunger or grumpyness between participants, others were due to lack of access to the right tools or understanding of processes, others were particular types of coding error. I propose that more granular understanding  of different kinds of design blocks can help facilitators and ultimately learners in building agency in their response to them.

 For example,  on into the detail and types or errors.  These include:

  -   **Syntax and Program Errors** are errors in your code which stop the game from functioning at all, often resulting in a blank screen.
  -   **No Behaviour Bugs** are errors which in your code which don't stop the game from functioning but your intended effect is not present when it should be.
  -   **Glitches** don't stop your game from running but as you play you see that there is an unintended effect. The game does something different from what we want it to do.
  -->

 <!-- #### Examples of Glitch types of errors

 Short examples of different types and the affect implications.

 Glitch errors can be productive.

 **Productive in exploring code / creating new game opportunites**
 An interesting one where the x / y axis mix up for Te 2019-03-18 leads to a new challenge in the game.

 **Productive in in**

 - Glitch - 2019-05-08 - Te and Da  - create moving enemy but it totally leaves the screen. This caused amusement and participants knew how they thought they would follow that up.

  The game making style of some participants -- for the most part young people -- seemed particularly likely to induce glitches and their unintended effects in game play. As a facilitator I began to celebrate these glitches with participants and explore with them the opportunities they provided to understand the related code in a way that was often concrete, engaging and and playful. -->


#### Analysis against (and calls to heed) existing design heuristics

Earlier we examined of challenges of the authenticity of the authentic tools set consisting of js, phaser, html, and a code-playround.

The complexity of coding and the resulting challenges of learning to code has yield much research on guidance in the process of designing toolsets to support novice coders [@resnick_reflections_2005] - (find others on the evolution of LOGO).  

The user-friendly design heuristics of  low-thresholds, wide-walls, high-ceilings - extended by Kafai and Burke to include open windows - can be used to evaluate this design and other designs.  

NOTE - ADD KEY DETAILS OF THE ACCESSIBILITY / CHALLENGE OF THE CORE TOOLS SET

In this design the tools set is disctinct from tools like scratch which are self-contained to a large degree (while interacting with a website)

The online only nature of the toolset does facilitate certain aspects of community participation by shifting the working space away from a desktop only environment, this facilitating some sharing by default. This was picked up on by the community as they viewed each others assets and playtested games.

Indeed, Scratch itself has moved to a web-bsaed online by default process in the lifespan of this research.  

**Summary:** These heuristics provide a useful tool for designers and practitioners supporting creative coding activities.}
