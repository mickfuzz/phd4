title: RD4 - Request for extension.


---



I'm writing to request an extension to PhD submission based on the conditions outlined in my PLP. My supervisor Cathy Lewin is supportive of this. The purpose of this email is to make an official request and to find out the process to get approval for this.

To give an overview of my circumstances. In short, the process of trying to hone down and integrate the many tangental aspects of my study has significantly delayed the process of writing up. I've been doing some good work to manage my stress levels in the process but still keep making progress. However the current deadline of 10th of November would involve a very stressful period managing this work along with teaching commitments of the new term. My mental health profile outlined in my PLP would contribute to and exacerbate this stress, as such I am requesting an extension.

I've submitted a Notice of Intention to Submit with a proposed date of 1st of Feb 2026. Based on conversations with Steve Lee that that period of about two and half months seems about right and gives me the Xmas break to complete.

### Thesis Title  - Supporting collaboration and agency in families’ retro game-making with code

**Research Questions (RQs)**

This research explores how socio-cultural approaches, particularly Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), can inform Computer Game Design and Programming (CGD&P) pedagogies. The study aims to enhance inclusive, engaging, and effective learning experiences within non-formal settings, with findings intended for broader application.


The overall aim of this study is best represented via the primary research question (PRQ) of this thesis: **How can pedagogies to support CGD&P be enriched using socio-cultural approaches to foster inclusive learning in non-formal contexts?**

To achieve this aim three sub-questions follow.

- RQ1. What contradictions emerged during participation in CGD&P activities and how were they addressed via an innovative pedagogy?
- RQ2. How can the use of a collection of game design patterns support CGD&P, in particular in relation to abstract and concrete dimensions of existing pedagogies?
- RQ3. How do learner agency and game-maker identity develop within CGD&P communities of practice, and what pedagogical strategies best support this evolution across diverse learning contexts?


### Research  objectives

<!-- The sub-questions are explored in greater details at the end of Chapter 2 in relation to the problem statement of the thesis. -->
<!-- MAKE THESE MORE SPECIFIC -->
<!-- & motivation (is motivation right here? how different from rationale and significance?) - IS THIS THE PROBLEM STATEMENT -->

This study is structured around three core objectives that align with its sub-questions above and the overarching aim to enrich pedagogical approaches to CGD&P using activity theory as a socio-cultural approach.

Addressing RQ1, the objective is to create a novel toolset and pedagogy that responds to gaps in the current research landscape and the limited resources available to practitioners. The study adapts my existing practice in facilitating web production to a new context: game-making using text-based code with families. This includes the use of FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) and industry-standard web technologies, with the aim of enhancing the longevity, authenticity, and extensibility of the game-making toolset. Through a design-based research approach, the study will identify and analyse the manifestations of contradictions within evolving CGD&P activities and explore their role in driving learning and innovation.

In relation to RQ2, the objective is to develop a clear yet flexible pedagogy informed by gameplay design patterns (GDPs). Given that few studies provide detailed accounts of pedagogical approaches to supporting learners in the game design process, this research explores how GDPs can function as mediating tools. In particular, it investigates their role in supporting the development of learner agency and in facilitating the appropriation of complex game design knowledge within CGD&P learning environments.

<!-- NOTE MAY NEED TO EXPLAIN GDPS A BIT MORE -->

Addressing RQ3, the research seeks to bring greater conceptual clarity to social and cultural motivations underpinning novice participants' engagement in CGD&P. The focus here is on understanding the development of learner agency through the lens of activity theory, and on examining how game-maker identities emerge within the context of a novel community of practice. This objective explores how these identities are nurtured and sustained across different learning communities, and what pedagogical strategies support this developmental process.

### Research implications

The implications of this research highlight the potential for reframing the primary focus of teaching computing through accessible project-based approaches structured around the application of relatable design patterns. I encourage wider testing of these processes to assess the generalisability of the findings based on several motivations. Firstly, the overall approach is aligned with solid foundations for using funds of identity as an inclusive and transformational practice for young people engaging with digital technology, as explored in a special issue of Mind, Culture and Activity [@kajamaa_young_2019-3]. Secondly, the process of using games as a medium for expressing these funds of identity remains a valid approach. While research on game making may have waned in popularity, interest from young people endures. Thirdly, in light of increased concerns about risky online activity and screen time addiction, family involvement in the digital lives of young people remains an ongoing issue. Game making as a joint family activity offers an accessible and inclusive foundation for exploring further digital issues that impact home lives.

Finally, we can hope that the pendulum of digital education in the UK and beyond may swing back from the conservative stance on the power of abstract knowledge, exemplified by Michael Gove's implementation of the computing curriculum and exam structure, towards a more applied approach [@preston_re-engineering_2013]. This shift would align with Papert's vision of computational thinking, which is grounded in concrete, hands-on computing experiences involving projects that can motivate personal connections to the underlying content knowledge in context.
