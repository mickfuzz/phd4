# Annual Review - Year 3 PT PhD

The primary aims of this review document is give to a short update on research activity and to frame emerging results from the study in line with existing material in this field.

## Summary of Activity since RD2

My RD2 was in December 2019. I was suspended from studies in Summer 2020 and restarted earlier this summer in June 2022. This section is a brief summary of some of the activities that I have managed to undertake in this timeframe.

## Data Gathering - Additional Material and Summary

In early 2020 I rad two additional courses on game making. The first involved a similar level of video data capture and participants to earlier courses with 360, the second was more restricted due to the rooms that were available. Limited screen capture data was recorded.

## Data Analysis

The process of data a


## Iterative Project Design Revision

Alternating between concrete and abstract - CT as a source of debate for this area - deepening my understanding and practitioner focus.

Emerging Focus on Design Patterns

### Creation of materials for Make Code

Based on cards for DPs, and additional challenges, and fictional design.


## Dissemination of results

While lock down presented some challenges. There were opportunities to disseminate early results.

- Online Mozilla Conference 2021: Mozilla were pioneers of in informal digital learning and associated tools [@sefton-green_mapping_2013]. I presented an overview of the key salient features of the 3M model during an online conference to replace the in-person event. The interactive presentation was well received.

### Online Presentation at Manchester Games Network

### Informal Participation on Playful Learning conferences

The use of games consoles loaded with games created by participants is an engaging way to talk about my research.

### Book chapters for background information.

The process of writing for and audience of teachers was productive in shaking up my thinking on Computational Thinking.

### Results in the 3M Framework as a book chapter.


## Next Goal write up one chapter of results

### Coding existing data

#### Data processing

#### Nvivo coding

when coding I started with some preset codes from the literature for examples Barron's codes on parent roles when helping digital projects. However, as coding progressed, I modified and extended these codes to better match the data I was working with.

### Explore how to present Missions part of 3M framework as chapter.

This involves developing a stream of activity which is treated in whole. While some writing about foundational aims and background context is included as a summary of the structure of the introduction and literature review of the intended thesis.

#### Revision of Research questions

Part of this early writing up process is to revise research questions. To so this I've used a Kanban software allowing rapid revision and repositioning of questions and concepts. [What is a KanBan approach. ]

The link of project-based learning to my own teaching at university and the focus on inclusive practices of recent writings steered me to include these broad terms into a revision of research questions. However, as coding began, the need to bring more focus to the questions became apparent.
