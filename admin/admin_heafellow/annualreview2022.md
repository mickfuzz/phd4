## Additional Data Gathering

Runs of Make Code
Beginning to

## Iterative Project Design Revision

Alternating between concrete and abstract - CT as a source of debate for this area - deepening my understanding and practitioner focus.

Emerging Focus on Design Patterns

### Creation of materials for Make Code

Based on cards for DPs, and additional challenges, and fictional design.

## Lock Down & suspended study

In Summer 2020 students who were also teaching part time were required to suspend studies. While this was frustrating, I did halt much writing and data gathering.

## Dissemination of results

While lock down presented some challenges. There were opportunities to disseminate early results.

### Online Mozilla Conference

### Online Presentation at Manchester Games Network

### Informal Participation on Playful Learning conferences

The use of games consoles loaded with games created by participants is an engaging way to talk about my research.

### Book chapters for background information.

The process of writing for and audience of teachers was productive in shaking up my thinking on Computational Thinking.

### Results in the 3M Framework as a book chapter.


## Next Goal write up one chapter of results

### Coding existing data

#### Data processing

#### Nvivo coding

when coding I started with some preset codes from the literature for examples Barron's codes on parent roles when helping digital projects. However, as coding progressed, I modified and extended these codes to better match the data I was working with.

### Explore how to present Missions part of 3M framework as chapter.

This involves developing a stream of activity which is treated in whole. While some writing about foundational aims and background context is included as a summary of the structure of the introduction and literature review of the intended thesis.

#### Revision of Research questions

Part of this early writing up process is to revise research questions. To so this I've used a Kanban software allowing rapid revision and repositioning of questions and concepts. [What is a KanBan approach. ]

The link of project-based learning to my own teaching at university and the focus on inclusive practices of recent writings steered me to include these broad terms into a revision of research questions. However, as coding began, the need to bring more focus to the questions became apparent.
